This prefix is expressed in Sanskrit by पुनर् or प्रति, by the former when ‘re’ signifies again, as in the verbs, ‘re-absorb,’ ‘re-appear;’ by the latter when it signifies back, as in the verbs, ‘re-demand,’ ‘repay.’ In cases where the word formed with ‘re’ is not given in this Dictionary, the student must take the simple verb or noun, and use the above prefixes."
