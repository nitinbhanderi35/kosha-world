            "content": "called also by the name अष्टक or पाणिनीय-अष्टकः name given to the SUtras of Paanini comprising eight adhyaayaas or books. The total number of SUtras as commented ' upon by the writers of the Kasika and the Siddhaantakaumudi is 3983. As nine sUtras out of these are described as Vaarttikas and two as Ganasutras by Patanjali, it is  evident that there were 3972 SUtras in the Astaka of Paanini according to Patanjali. A verse current among Vaiyakarana schools states the number to be 3996; cf. त्रीणि सूत्रसह्यखाणि तथा नव शतानि व ' षण्णवतिश्च सूत्राणां पाणिनिः कृतवान् स्वयम् | The traditional recital by Veda Scholars who look upon the Astadhyayi as a Vedaanga, consists of 3983 Sutras which are accepted and commented upon by all later grammarians and commentators. The SUtras of Paanini, which mainly aim at the correct formation of words, discuss declension, conjugation, euphonic changes, verbal derivatives, noun derivatives and accents. For details see Vol.VII, Vyaakarana Mahaabhaasya, D. E. Society's edition pp. 152-162."
