Saṃśaptakavadha). § 591: <i>Droṇa</i> confessed his inability to seize <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> if <i>Arjuna</i> were by. The <i>Trigarta</i> king said that <i>Arjuna</i> had always injured them, and took an oath that either <i>Arjuna</i> or the <i>Trigartas</i> should be slain. This oath was taken by the five brothers <i>Satyaratha</i>, etc., (α) with their 10,000 chariots, and by the <i>Mālava</i> king, etc. (β). Then they summoned <i>Arjuna</i> towards the southern part of the field. <i>Arjuna</i> told <i>Satyajit</i> to guard <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and went out against the <i>Trigartas</i> (VII, <b>17</b>). —§ 592: THE TWELFTH DAY'S BATTLE. The <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> rejoiced at the prospect of fighting <i>Arjuna</i>, who addressed Kṛṣṇa about this ill-timed joy, and terrified them with the sound of <i>Devadatta</i>, and attacked them. <i>Subāhu & Arjuna; Suśarman</i>, etc. (α) & <i>Arjuna</i>; they fled to <i>Duryodhana</i>; but urged by the <i>Trigarta</i> king, they once more returned to the field with the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> cowherds (VII, <b>18</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> conveyed <i>Arjuna</i> to the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>. The <i>Nārāyaṇas & Arjuna</i> (<i>+ Kṛṣṇa); Arjuna</i> blew <i>Devadatta</i> and employed the <i>Tvāṣṭra</i> weapon, that confounded the foes, who began to fight each other; <i>Arjuna</i> crushed the <i>Lalitthas</i>, etc. (β), and with the <i>Vāyavya</i> weapon he dispersed the arrows shot by his foes, and <i>Vāyu</i> blew away crowds of <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> with their steeds, etc. Meanwhile <i>Droṇa</i> attacked <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (VII, <b>19</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> had arrayed his troops in the shape of a <i>garuḍa: Droṇa</i> in the mouth; <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers = the head; <i>Kṛtararman</i> and <i>Kṛpa</i> = the two eyes; <i>Bhūtaśarman</i>, etc. (γ), in its neck; <i>Bhūriśravas</i>, etc. (δ), in the right wing; <i>Vinda</i>, etc. (ε), in the left wing before <i>Aśvatthāman</i>; in the back the <i>Kaliṅgas</i>, etc. (ζ); in the tail <i>Karṇa</i> with his sons, etc.; <i>Jayadratha</i>, etc. (η), in the bosom; in the midst the <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> king. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> disposed his troops in the shape of a semicircle. <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna &</i> <i>Droṇa + Duṛmukha Dhārtarāṣṭra; Droṇa</i> dispersed <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira's</i> host (VII, <b>20</b>). <i>Droṇa & Yudhiṣṭhira + Satyajit +</i> <i>Vṛka; Satyajit</i> was slain by <i>Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira</i> fled. The <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (θ), attacked <i>Droṇa</i>, and were consumed; <i>Śatā-</i> <i>nīka</i> (younger brother of the <i>Matsya</i> king) & <i>Droṇa</i>, who slew him; the <i>Matsyas</i> fled. <i>Droṇa</i> defeated the <i>Cedis</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa; Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc. (κ), & <i>Droṇa; Droṇa</i> slew <i>Kṣema. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> fled away. <i>Droṇa</i> slew <i>Pāñcālya</i> (<i>Pāñcālyanāmnā</i>, Nīl.). <i>Droṇa</i> crushed the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (λ), and, supported by the <i>Kurus</i>, he vanquished <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (μ). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> fled away in all directions (VII, <b>21</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> addressed <i>Karṇa</i> in joy, beholding the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (ν), broken by <i>Droṇa</i>, and <i>Bhīmasena</i> abandoned by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Sṛñjayas. Karṇa</i> said that <i>Bhīmasena</i>, followed by <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ξ), would never leave the fight; <i>Duryodhana</i> proceeded to <i>Droṇa's</i> chariot, where a deafening noise was heard of <i>Pāṇḍava</i> warriors returning to the fight (VII, <b>22</b>). At the request of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> described the steeds of <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (ο), especially mentioning <i>Bṛhanta (b</i>); the standards of <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (π), and the bows of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ρ) (VII, <b>23</b>). The despondency of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, mentioning <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (σ) (VII, <b>24</b>). When the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> returned to fight and attacked <i>Droṇa</i>, the <i>Kurus</i> were afraid. <i>Duryodhana</i> urged his troops against them. <i>Durmarṣaṇa Dhārtarāṣṭra</i> <i>& Bhīma; Kṛtavarman & Yuyudhāna</i>; the <i>Sindhu</i> king & <i>Kṣatravarman; Subāhu & Yuyutsu</i>, who cut off the two arms of <i>Subāhu; Śalya & Yudhiṣṭhira; Bāhlīka & Drupada</i>; <i>Vinda</i> and <i>Anuvinda & Virāṭa</i>; that encounter between the <i>Matsyas</i> and the <i>Kekayas</i> resembled that between D. and As. in days of old; <i>Bhūtakarman Sabhāpati & Nakula's</i> son <i>Śatānīka; Bhūtakarman</i> was slain by <i>Śatānīka; Viviṃśati &</i> <i>Sutasoma; Bhīmaratha (Dhārṭarāṣṭra</i>) slew <i>Śālva; Citra-</i> <i>sena's</i> son & <i>Śrutakarman; Prativindhya & Aśvatthāman</i>; the son of <i>Duḥśāsana & Śrutakīrti</i> (the son of <i>Arjuna</i> by <i>Draupadī</i>); <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> (son of <i>Duryodhana</i>) & <i>Paṭaccarahantṛ</i>; <i>Vikarṇa (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & Śikhaṇḍin; Aṅgada & Uttamaujas</i>; <i>Durmukha & Purujit; Karṇa</i> & the five <i>Kekaya</i> brothers; <i>Durjaya + Jaya + Vijaya (Dhārtarāṣṭrāḥ) & Nīla +</i> the <i>Kāśi</i> king + <i>Jayatsena; Kṣemadhūrti + Bṛhanta & Sātyaki</i>; the <i>Cedi</i> king & <i>Ambaṣṭha; Kṛpa & Vārdhakṣemi; Soma—</i> <i>datta's</i> son & <i>Maṇimat; Vṛṣasena</i> (the son of <i>Karṇa</i>) & <i>Pāṇḍya; Ghaṭotkaca & Alambuṣa</i> (VII, <b>25</b>); <i>Duryodhana &</i> <i>Bhīmasena</i>; the <i>Aṅga</i> king (Mleccha king) & do.; <i>Bhīma</i> slew him, and his divisions fied; the <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> king (upon his elephant <i>Supratīka</i>) & <i>Bhīma</i> (who knew the <i>añjalikāvedha</i>); <i>Bhīma</i> escaped from the elephant, but was supposed to have been slain; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (+ the <i>Pāñcālas</i>) & <i>Bhagadatta</i> (upon <i>Supratīka</i>); the <i>Daśārṇa</i> king (upon his elephant) & <i>Bhagadatta; Bhagadatta & Yuyudhāna; Bhagadatta</i> destroyed the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops; <i>Bhīma & Bhagadatta</i>, whose elephant frightened <i>Bhīma's</i> steeds, that bore <i>Bhīma</i> away; <i>Ruciparvan</i> (<i>Kṛtī-sutaḥ) & Bhagadatta</i>, who slew him; <i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc. (τ), & <i>Bhagadatta's</i> elephant; <i>Yuyutsu</i> had his steeds and charioteer trod down and fled; <i>Duryodhana(?) & Abhimanyu</i>; <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (υ) & <i>Bhagadatta</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops fled (VII, <b>26</b>). Urged by <i>Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa</i> began to proceed against <i>Bhagadatta</i>; the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> (10,000 <i>Trigartas</i> and 4,000 <i>Nārāyaṇāḥ (Vāsudevasyānugāḥ</i>)) challenged <i>Arjuna</i>, and he encountered them, shot the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, defeated and slew them, and then turned against <i>Bhagadatta</i> (VII, <b>27</b>); but as <i>Suśarman</i> with his brothers followed him from behind, he again attacked <i>Suśarman</i>, and then again <i>Bhagadatta</i> (VII, <b>28</b>); <i>Bhagadatta</i>, at last, by means of <i>mantras</i> changed his hook into the <i>Vaiṣṇava</i> weapon, which, received by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> on his breast, became a garland. As <i>Arjuna</i> taxed <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> for his taking part in the battle, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> related the history of the <i>Vaiṣṇavāstra (c</i>). “The great <i>Asura</i> has now been divested of that supreme weapon; now slay <i>Bhagadatta</i>, that enemy of the gods, even as I formerly for the benefit of the worlds slew the <i>Asura Naraka.”</i> <i>Arjuna</i> then slew both <i>Bhagadatta</i> (who was ever the favourite and friend of <i>Indra</i>, v. 1302), and the elephant (VII, <b>29</b>). Then <i>Arjuna</i> slew the two brothers <i>Vṛṣa[ka]</i> and <i>Acala</i> (sons of the <i>Gāndhāra</i> king <i>Subala</i>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> sons attacked <i>Arjuna</i>, and <i>Śakuni</i> created illusions in order to confound him and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>: clubs, etc., and asses, etc., which <i>Arjuna</i> slew with celestial weapons; then darkness, whence proceeded harsh voices; this <i>Arjuna</i> dispelled with the weapon <i>Jyotiṣka</i>; then waves of water, dried up with the <i>Āditya</i> weapon; <i>Śakuni</i> fled. <i>Arjuna</i> slaughtered the <i>Kuru</i> army: one stream proceeded towards <i>Droṇa</i>, one towards <i>Duryodhana</i>; a fierce battle took place on the southern side between <i>Arjuna</i> and the <i>Kurus</i>. The various divisions of <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira's</i> force smote the foe on every part of the field (VII, <b>30</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> + the <i>Kurus & Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ϕ), + the <i>Pāṇḍavas; Nīla & Aśvatthāman</i>, who slew him; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> regretted that <i>Arjuna</i> was engaged in the southern part of the field in slaughtering the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> and the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> force (VII, <b>31</b>). <i>Bhīmasena & Bāhlīka + Karṇa; Droṇa</i>, etc. (χ) & <i>Bhīma; Yudhiṣṭhira</i> despatched <i>Nakula</i>, etc. (ψ), to the rescue of <i>Bhīma; Bhīma</i>, etc., & <i>Droṇa</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ω) & <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (αα). <i>Arjuna</i>, having slain the <i>Saṃśaptakas, & Droṇa</i> + the <i>Kurus + Arjuna</i>, who employed the <i>Āgneya</i> weapon; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ββ) & <i>Karṇa</i>; <i>Arjuna</i> slew three of <i>Karṇa's</i> brothers (γγ); <i>Bhīma</i> slew fifteen of <i>Karṇa's</i> combatants; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> slew <i>Candra-</i> <i>varman</i>, etc. (δδ); <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (εε) & <i>Sātyaki</i>, rescuing <i>Karṇa; Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ζζ) protected <i>Sātyaki</i>.
