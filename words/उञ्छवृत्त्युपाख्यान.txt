Then there came to him a wise brahman as a guest (XII, <b>354</b>); him he asked what he, having entrusted his duties as a householder to his son, should do in order to perform the highest duty of men, as he had no respect for the religion of the <i>Yatis</i>, who depend upon alms. The guest said that he was himself perplexed, as heaven had many doors (examples) (XII, <b>355</b>); he told him (according to what he learnt from his preceptor) to repair to <i>Padma</i>, the righteous <i>Nāga</i>, who lived in the city called after the <i>Nāgas</i> in the <i>Naimiṣa</i> forest, on the banks of the <i>Gomatī</i>, whence, in a former creation (<i>pūrvābhisarge</i>) the wheel of righteousness was set in motion (<i>dharmacakraṃ pravartitaṃ</i>), and where all the gods had, in days of old, performed a great sacrifice, and where king <i>Māndhātṛ</i> neglected (<i>atikramañ</i> <i>cakre) Indra</i> (XII, <b>356</b>). The host became delighted, and passed the night happily conversing with his guest about the fourth mode of life (<i>caturthadharma</i>) [i.e. <i>sannyāsa</i>, renunciation, PCR.; = <i>mokṣadharma</i>, Nīl.]; the next morning, having dismissed his guest, he set out for the abode of the <i>Nāga</i> (XII, <b>357</b>), was shown the way by an ascetic, and received by the beautiful wife of the <i>Nāga</i>; as the <i>Nāga</i> had gone to draw the chariot of <i>Sūrya</i> for a month, and would be back in seven or eight days, he passed this time on the banks of the <i>Gomalī</i> (XII, <b>358</b>). On the 6th day the <i>Nāgas</i> of the city, seeing him abstaining from food and [only] reciting <i>mantras</i>, came and asked him to eat; but he wanted to keep his fast for eight days; if then the <i>Nāga</i>-chief had not come back, he would break his fast. Then the <i>Nāgas</i> returned (XII, <b>359</b>). When the <i>Nāga</i>-chief came home, he was informed by his wife about the brahman's arrival (XII, <b>360</b>). The <i>Nāga</i> doubted whether that brahman was a human being, as the <i>Nāgas</i>, even by D., As., and D-ṛ, are considered to be endued with great energy; his wife told him to go and speak to the guest without the wrath which is natural to <i>Nāgas</i>; the <i>Nāga</i> himself also blamed wrath, citing <i>Rāvaṇa</i> (who became the rival of <i>Śakra</i> and was slain by <i>Rāma</i>) and the sons of <i>Kārtavīrya</i> (who were slain by <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>) and <i>Kārtavīrya</i> himself (XII, <b>361</b>). The <i>Nāga</i> met with the brahman (who characterized himself as a righteous being (<i>dharmāraṇya = muni</i>, Nīl.)) on the banks of the <i>Gomatī</i>, engaged in Yoga and reciting the <i>Vedas</i> in order to dispel all evil from the <i>Nāga</i> (XII, <b>362</b>); he asked the <i>Nāga</i> whether he had seen anything wonderful in those regions where he had drawn the one-wheeled chariot of <i>Vivasvat</i>. The <i>Nāga</i> described the wonders of which the Sun is the source (α). The most wonderful was that one day, in former times, at the hour of noon, a being came through the sky like a second sun and entered <i>Sūrya</i> (XII, <b>363</b>). <i>Sūrya</i> declared it to be a brahman, who had attained to heaven on account of his having been crowned with success (<i>siddhaḥ</i>) in the gleaning-vow (<i>uñchavṛttivrate</i>) (description), and because he had gratified <i>Bhava</i> (Śiva) by praising him with <i>saṃhitāḥ</i>, and now he “goes round the earth staying in the disc of <i>Sūrya</i>; neither D., nor G., As., nor Pn. are superior to those creatures that attain to this excellent end” (XII, <b>364</b>). The brahman then betook himself formally to the practice of the <i>uñcha</i>-vow (XII, <b>365</b>), and having saluted the <i>Nāga</i>, he went to <i>Cyavana Bhārgava</i>, who initiated him and recited the story of the brahman in king <i>Janaka's</i> palace to D-ṛ. <i>Nārada > Indra ></i> the foremost brahmans. “During my (i.e. Bhīṣma's) battle with <i>Rāma</i>, the <i>Vasus</i> told it to me.” The brahman proceeded to another forest (XII, <b>366</b>)."
