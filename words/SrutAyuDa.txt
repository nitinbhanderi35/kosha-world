Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 23; Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 16, Verse 34). <dvsn n='NI'/>In Bhārata battle he took his stand on the Kaurava side and at first clashed with Bhīmasena. Even at the beginning of the battle, Bhīma killed Satya and Satyadeva, two of the assistants of Śrutāyudha. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 50, Verse 69). In the end, he used his cudgel—which was given to him by Varuṇa—against Śrī Kṛṣṇa who did not take part in the battle at all. Śrutāyudha died by his own Cudgel. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter, 67, Verses 43-48). (See also under Śrutāyus II)."
