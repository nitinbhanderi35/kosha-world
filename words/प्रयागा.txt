            "content": "<i>Prayāgā</i> (II)¦ — (Māhātmyam): Markaṇḍeya to Yudhiṣṭhira on; here is Prajāpatikṣetra; people who bathe here go to heaven and who die here are liberated from <i>samsāra;</i> guarded by Indra; there are five deep channels in Prayāgā with the Ganges flowing in their midst. Sins are washed off by entering its boundary. The goddess Yamunā, the daughter of the Sun God is ever present: It is a place haunted by the Gods, Asuras, Ṛṣis and Siddhas;<sup>1</sup> one who remembers Prayāgā from his own native home or from a foreign place on the eve of his death goes to the world of Brahmā. Leaving the heaven, he is reborn as a King of Jambūdvīpa; gifts of cows, jewels and gold here attain great merit: The giver is born in Uttara Kuru regions and enjoys long life.<sup>2</sup> One should not drive to the place in a conveyance drawn by bullocks lest the virtue of bathing should be lost. Giving daughters in marriage, and death near the Akṣayavaṭa helps one in going to the world of Śiva. One should go and do charities with utmost faith. Here are 60 crores and 10000 holy spots; wellknown for a Śiva shrine: Pratiṣṭhāna lies to the east of the Ganges, and to its north lies the Hamsaprapatana <i>Tīrtha.</i> There are again Ūrvaśīramaṇa, Sandhya Vaṭa, Koṭī <i>Tīrtha,</i> and others, all holy;<sup>3</sup> by merely listening to the greatness of Prayāgā a man gets liberated. To the south of Prayāgā there is a Ṛṇamocana <i>Tīrtha</i> where by residing for a night and by bathing, one never runs into debts. A pilgrimage to P. gives the benefit of an Aśvamedha sacrifice: relieves his <i>manes</i> for ten generations: its circumference is five yojanas and every step is sacred: the greatness of the Yamunā described;<sup>4</sup> a man dying at P. gets the benefits of a Yogin: the king of all <i>tīrthas:</i> P. is again the place where both Kambala and Aśvatara reside. It is the altar of Prajāpati. It is more sacred, being situated on the banks of the Ganges. It is the giver of heaven, the personification of bliss and truth: Reading the Mahātmya takes one to heaven;<sup>5</sup> Here Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva are all present. Brahmā stands on the Northern part of the <i>Tīrtha</i> to protect it: Viṣṇu is represented as Veṇī Mādhava, while Śiva is present in the shape of a banyan tree. In addition to them, the gods, oceans and mountains also live there. It is known as Prajāpati Indrakṣetra. One who remembers this every day attains heaven. After hearing this, Yudhiṣṭhira is said to have bathed in Prayāgā.<sup>6</sup> <F>1) M. ch. 104.</F> <F>2) Ib. ch. 105.</F> <F>3) Ib. ch. 106.</F> <F>4) Ib. chh. 107-8.</F> <F>5) Ib. chh. 109-110.</F> <F>6) Ib. chh. 111-112; 180. 56; 192. 11; 193. 19.</F>"
