When the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara ended and the Vaivasvata Manvantara commenced all the twelve were born as sons of Kaśyapa of his wife Aditi. Because they were born of Aditi they were called Dvādaśādityas. They were Viṣṇu etc. Thus the Tuṣitas of the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara were the Dvādaśādityas of Vaivasvata Manvantara. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15)."
