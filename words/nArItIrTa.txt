Once Arjuna bathed in Bharadvājatīrtha. The Apsarā women called Vargās were living in the five tīrthas in the form of crocodiles as the result of a curse. With the arrival of Arjuna there, the crocodiles resumed their previous forms as Apsarā women and returned to Devaloka. (For the curse etc. see under Vargā)."
