When Bhagīratha brought Gaṅgā from heaven to the earth, sea water began to rise and the temples situated near the sea were submerged. At that time Śuṣka went along with other Maharṣis to visit Paraśurāma at the Mahendra mountain. In response to Śuṣka's prayer, Paraśurāma raised the submerged temples including the Gokarṇa temple, above the water."
