But the knowledge of the river is implied in the reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>26</sup> We find from the Amarakośa<sup>27</sup> that Revā is another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the name of the chief was derived from his association with the river.<sup>28</sup> The Raghuvaṃśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).<sup>29</sup> It has been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas.<sup>30</sup> The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from serpents.<sup>31</sup> The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.<sup>32</sup> According to the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from the Vindhya itself.<sup>33</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.<sup>34</sup> Several rivers such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī<sup>35</sup> are mentioned as falling into the Narmadā."

Out of the three cities comprising Tripura, (s.v.) two fell down reduced to ashes. The first city became converted into the Śri Śaila hill, and the second Amarakaṇṭaka hill, both adorned by the Siddhas, Gandharvas and so on. The Lord enshrined at the latter is Jvāleśvara.
