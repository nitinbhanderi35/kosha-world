Mahāprasthānika(ṃ) parva(n)).—§ 794: <i>Janamejaya</i> said: Having heard of the battle with iron clubs between the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i>, and of <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> ascension to heaven, what did the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> do? <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the <i>Vṛṣṇis, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> set his heart on leaving the world, saying to his brothers that it is Time that ripens every creature, of which they approved. He made the kingdom over to <i>Yuyutsu</i> and installed <i>Parikṣit</i> as king in <i>Rāstinapura</i>, while <i>Vajra</i> ruled in <i>Indraprastha</i>. Then he offered oblations of water to <i>Kṛṣṇa, Rāma</i>, and <i>Vasudeva</i>, etc., and <i>śrāddhas</i> to his deceased kinsmen, and fed <i>Vyāsa, Nārada, Mārkaṇḍeya</i>, and <i>Yājñavalkya</i>, and gave jewels, etc. (specification) to brahmans in honour of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. <i>Kṛpa</i> was installed as the preceptor of <i>Parikṣit</i>. Then he summoned his subjects and informed them of his intentions; they tried in vain to dissuade him. He and his brothers and <i>Draupadī</i> removed their ornaments and wore barks of trees; then they threw their sacred fires into the water. Then they set out on their journey: the five <i>Pāṇḍavas, Draupadī</i>, and a dog. <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc., stood around <i>Yuyutsu; Ulūpī</i> entered the waters of <i>Gaṅgā; Citrāṅgada</i> set out for <i>Maṇipūra</i>; the grandmothers of <i>Parikṣit</i> surrounded him. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc., set out with their faces turned towards the east, devoting themselves to <i>yoga</i>, resolved to observe the religion of renunciation; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> first, then the other <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in the order of their birth, behind them all <i>Draupadī</i>; a dog followed them. They reached the sea of red water. <i>Agni</i> came, and mentioning the <i>Khāṇḍava</i> forest, etc. (α), he caused <i>Arjuna</i> to throw the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> and his inexhaustible quivers into the water to be given back to <i>Varuṇa</i>. Then <i>Agni</i> disappeared. They now proceeded towards the south; then, by the northern coast of the salt sea, to the south-west; then towards the west, where they saw <i>Dvārakā</i> covered by the ocean; then to the north, observant of <i>yoga</i>, desirous of making a round of the whole earth (XVII, <b>1</b>). They crossed <i>Himavat</i>, and beheld a vast desert of sand, and then <i>Meru. Kṛṣṇā</i> dropped down; asked by <i>Bhīmasena</i>, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that this was the consequence of her partiality for <i>Arjuna</i>. Then <i>Sahadeva</i> fell down; asked by <i>Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said it was because he never thought anybody his equal in wisdom. They went on. <i>Nakula</i> fell; asked by <i>Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said it was because he thought that nobody equalled him in beauty, though his righteousness was without blemish. <i>Arjuna</i> fell down; asked by <i>Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that it was because <i>Arjuna</i> had said that he would consume all the foes in a single day, but did not accomplish it. <i>Bhīmasena</i> fell down; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> told him it was because he was a great eater, and used to boast of his strength. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> went on with the dog (XVII, <b>2</b>). <i>Indra</i> came with a chariot, and asked <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to ascend it for going to Heaven; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wanted to take <i>Draupadī</i> and his fallen brothers with him; <i>Indra</i> said they have already reached Heaven, where he will see them; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> would have the dog to accompany him; † as <i>Indra</i> said there is no place in Heaven for persons with dogs, as the <i>Krodhavaśas</i> take away all the merits of such persons, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> refused to ascend the chariot. Then [the dog, transformed into] <i>Dharma</i>, said to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (†vv. 80—9) that he had formerly tested him in the <i>Dvaitavana</i>, where he had chosen the revival of <i>Nakula</i>, disregarding <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, for doing good to his [step] mother; “there is no one in Heaven that is equal to thee.” Then <i>Dharma, Indra</i>, M., A., D., D.-ṛ., causing <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to ascend the chariot, proceeded to Heaven on their respective chariots. <i>Nārada</i> said that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was superior to all the R.-ṛ. there. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to proceed to where his brothers were; <i>Indra</i>, saying that his brothers had won regions of felicity, tried to persuade him to stay, beholding D.-ṛ. and Si.; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to be united with his brothers and <i>Draupadī</i> (XVII, <b>3</b>)."
