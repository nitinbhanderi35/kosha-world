Bhīṣma went to Madra and brought Mādrī for Pāṇḍu. (Chapter 112, Ādi Parva). At the time of Arjuna's birth there was a voice from heaven which said, “This child will grow up and capture many countries like Madra”. Aśvapati, father of Sāvitrī, was a king of Madra. Karṇa condemned Madra and Vāhīka as countries which had fallen low in virtue. (Chapter 44, Karṇa Parva)."
