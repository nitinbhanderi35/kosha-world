There are innumerable stories of this kind in Purāṇas. Some important events connected with Menakā are given below: <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Mother of Pramadvarā.</i> Once Menakā became pregnant by a Gandharva named Viśvāvasu. On the day she delivered she threw the child on the banks of a river and went to Svarga. A sage named Sthūlakeśa who was doing penance nearby took the babe and brought it up. When she grew up she was named Pramadvarā and Ruru married her. (See under Pramadvarā). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Birth of Śakuntalā.</i> When Viśvāmitra was performing penance in the forests, Menakā, under instructions from Indra, went and enticed Viśvāmitra and broke the continuity of his penance. A girl was born to Menakā and became later the celebrated Śakuntalā. (See under Śakuntalā). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Again with Viśvāmitra.</i> Once again when Viśvāmitra was performing penance in Puṣkaratīrtha, Menakā approached him and again Viśvāmitra fell in love with her and they lived together for ten years. Then one day Viśvāmitra realised his folly and leaving her went again to the forests for penance. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Maṅkaṇa was enticed</i> See under Maṅkaṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) When once Durvāsas visited Devaloka it was Menakā who presented him with a flower garland. This incident led to the churning of the milk ocean at a later period. (See under Amṛta). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Menakā was one among the six prominent celestial maidens. Urvaśī, Pūrvacitti, Sahajanyā, Menakā, Ghṛtācī and Viśvācī are the six. (Śloka 68, Chapter 74, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Menakā attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna and sang on the occasion. (Śloka 64, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Menakā was a dancer in the court of Kubera (Śloka 10, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Menakā once gave a music performance in the court of Indra in honour of Arjuna. (Śloka 29, Chapter 43, Vana Parva)."
