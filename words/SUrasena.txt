Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha explains how the Yādava Kings came to rule over Mathurā. <dvsn n='NI'/>There was a region called Madhuvanam in the Kālindī river valley. Madhu, the Asura, who lived in Madhuvana had a son named Lavaṇa. Lavaṇa who was a tyrant and an oppressor of the gods, was killed by Śatrughna who established his rule there. In course of time, the place came to be known as “Madhurā”. After Śatrughna's time his two sons ruled over the country. Thus the Solar dynasty came to an end and Mathurā purī came under the rule of Yadus. The first King of Yaduvaṃśa was Śūrasena. Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of this Śūrasena. After the death of his father, since Vasudeva took up the occupation of tending cows, Ugrasena became King there.
