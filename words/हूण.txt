            "content": "5. <i>Hūṇa</i>¦ (No. 13, L. 15): They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 — 467) is stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.<sup>107</sup> The defeat inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their depredations.<sup>108</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a Central Asian tribe. <dvsn n='P'/>Uigur<sup>109</sup> transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’, the other <i>‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’.</i> The first part (<i>xun</i> — ) of the last form is not in doubt and neither is the <i>u</i> of the last part, the only question is about the change of the initial <i>i</i> of ancient Chinese into <i>y</i> in Uigur before <i>u</i> and in Sandhi, and about the pronunciation of the final consonant.<sup>110</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close to the <i>Hunu</i> as to the Sanskrit <i>Hūṇa</i> is very similar to the Chinese “transcription” <i>Xunu</i> or <i>Xūnu,</i> and Avesta <i>Hunu,</i> except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel <i>‘u’</i> the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that language. “The Purāṇas have a form <i>Urṇa</i> which together with Epic Skr. <i>Hūṇa</i> suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, <i>Xūrnu</i>”.<sup>111</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We may note here the Tibetan <i>Hor,</i> which corresponds with the first syllable of the reconstructed form <i>Hūr-ṇa.</i> The difference of vowels may indicate a back diphthong or back vowel between <i>o</i> and <i>u,</i> as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since the Greeks wrote <i>u (y)</i> for Indic <i>u.</i><sup>112</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form, we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns, Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosibirians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that there must have been several subject people and subject armies in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.<sup>113</sup> Otto Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology, and archaeology<sup>114</sup> and has pointed out that the greater part of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol<sup>115</sup> Later Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the <i>Hsiung</i>-nu and <i>Huns</i> were Turks.<sup>116</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Louis Bazin<sup>117</sup> and Von Gabain<sup>118</sup> also reached the conclusion that in language of the <i>Hsiung-nu</i> there was a high percentage of Turkish words.<sup>119</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the second century B.C. the <i>Hiung-nu (Huns)</i> started a movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half of the fourth century A.D., a branch of them, the White Huns, or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the Guptas into pieces’.<sup>120</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia. Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.<sup>121</sup> We know of a <i>Hūṇa-deśa</i> placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab region practically suggesting the same area.<sup>122</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.<sup>123</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription<sup>124</sup> and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.<sup>125</sup> These two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab) referring to <i>Rājādhirāja Mahārāja</i> Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla), whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned in the Eraṇ Inscription,<sup>126</sup> but others regard the two as quite different.<sup>127</sup> Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscriptions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any reference to the Hūṇas. <dvsn n='P'/>We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).<sup>128</sup> Here Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrabhāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.<sup>129</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rājataraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas. <dvsn n='P'/>It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal<sup>130</sup> and Fleet<sup>131</sup> held that Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow<sup>132</sup> holds that Toramāṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed, and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.<sup>133</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian literature. D.C. Sircar<sup>134</sup> opines that the Indian names <i>Hūṇa,</i> <i>Hārahūṇa</i> or <i>Hārahūra,</i> supposed to be associated with the Chinese name <i>Hiung-nu</i> and ‘the White Hun’ of the European writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘<i>ajayad-gupta</i> (or Japto or Jarto) <i>Hūṇān</i>’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to express an event which occurred within the life-time of the author.<sup>135</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman<sup>136</sup> a reference is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named. The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed countries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas could subdue.<sup>137</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.<sup>138</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.<sup>139</sup> The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily overwhelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirakula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihirakula but finally triumphed over his rival.<sup>140</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to be even a disturbing element in Indian History.<sup>141</sup> The Purāṇas place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras, Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.<sup>142</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus<sup>143</sup>, the (pale) faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands (who died in the battle).<sup>144</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Varāhamihira<sup>145</sup> mentions them under the jurisdiction of Ketu and places them in the North.<sup>146</sup> Dr. Upendra Thakur<sup>147</sup> remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost lost their original name of <i>Hiong-nou</i> or <i>Huns.</i> Later the powerful Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the <i>Hiong-nou</i> or <i>Huns</i> received different names in different periods beginning with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their exact origin and ethnic affinities. <dvsn n='P'/>We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa (a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-MalwaGujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings of Bengal<sup>148</sup>"
