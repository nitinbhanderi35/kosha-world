Seeing the daughter of <i>S., Parvata</i> asked if she was Śrī, etc. (α). <i>Nārada</i> obtained her as his wife. <i>Parvata</i> cursed <i>Nārada</i>, saying that he should not go to heaven at his will, and <i>Nārada</i> (enumerating what constitutes a marriage) cursed <i>Parvata</i>, saying that he should not go to heaven without him. Meanwhile, king <i>S.</i>, desirous of a son, prevailed upon the brahmans to ask <i>Nārada</i> on his behalf, and, urged by <i>Nārada</i>, he prayed for a son possessed of every accomplishment, and whose urine, etc. should be of gold. This son was named <i>Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin</i> (“gold-spitter”), and increased the wealth [of his father] beyond all limits (description). Some robbers seized the prince and slew him, and cut his body into fragments but without finding any gold. The robbers then slew one another and sank into an unimaginably awful hell. To <i>Sṛñjaya</i>, who was afflicted with deep sorrow, the D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i> told the <i>Ṣoḍaśarājika</i> (q.v.), i.e., the histories of sixteen kings who had died (except the last, viz. <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>), ending each narrative with the words: “as he died who was superior to thee and to thy son, thou shouldst not grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.” (Each narrative then ends with the words: <i>Śvai-</i> <i>tyeti vyāharan</i> [read <i>vyāharat</i>]; Nīl. takes Śvaitya (i.e. son of Śvitya) as a name of <i>S.</i>, cf. also XII, 1052) (VII, <b>55-70</b>).

(pl.): Name of a people, very likely a section of the Pāñcālas; sometimes they are almost identified with them, but sometimes mentioned along with them and / or with Somakas. <b>A.</b> Description of their warriors: Magnanimous (<i>mahātman</i>) 6. 85. 21; very vigorous (<i>mahaujas</i>) 7. 132. 41; heroic (<i>vīra</i>) 6. 68. 15; of great strength (<i>mahā-</i> <i>bala</i>) 6. 86. 76; 6. 103. 11; difficult to be attacked (<i>durādharṣa</i>) 6. 103. 10; great archers (<i>maheṣvāsa</i>) 6. 16. 42; 8. 40. 4; great chariot-fighters (<i>mahāratha</i>) 8. 40. 2; tigers among men (<i>puruṣavyāghra</i>) 7. 101. 51. <b>B.</b> Epic events: (1) Bhīma told Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to get back the kingdom by waging war with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas wish well of him and keep quiet (only he and Draupadī got excited) (<i>sarve te priyam</i> <i>icchanti bāndhavāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ / aham</i> <i>eko 'bhisaṃtapto mātā ca prativindhyataḥ //</i>) 3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their share of kingdom before war broke out in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5. 56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upaplavya, he asked him (Saṃjaya) to enquire about the health of all including Sṛñjayas (<i>teṣāṃ bhāgaṃ … purā yuddhāt sādhu tasya</i> <i>pradānam // … anāmayaṃ madvacanena pṛ-</i> <i>ccheḥ</i>) 5. 22. 8-9, 38; (3) Sañjaya wanted Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and the rest of the assembled kings would live in happiness (<i>śamaṃ kuryā yena śarmāpnuyus te</i>) 5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya to communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were also present 5. 25. 1; Saṃjaya appealed to all of them to act in a way that would lead to the well-being of Kurus and Sṛñjayas (<i>kṛtāñjaliḥ śaraṇaṃ vaḥ prapadye</i> <i>kathaṃ svasti syāt kurusṛñjayānām</i>) 5. 25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had usurped the prosperity of Pāṇḍavas (<i>kathaṃ svasti syāt</i> <i>kurusṛñjayānām / āttaiśvaryo dhṛtarāṣṭraḥ</i> <i>parebhyaḥ /</i>) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were capable of controlling their enemies and delighting their friends (<i>sṛñjayāś … /upāsīnā</i> <i>vāsudevasya buddhiṃ … </i>) 5. 28. 11; (4) Saṃjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that Arjuna wanted him to convey to the Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭadyumna fighting at the head of the army of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṃjaya that their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in astrology had predicted the destruction of Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37, 93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who could see and listen to the words of Kṛṣṇa which were meant for the welfare of Sṛñjayas (<i>bhāratīm … śaṅkarīṃ sṛñjayā-</i> <i>nām</i>) 5. 69. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 71. 2: <i>śaṃkarīṃ kalyāṇakarīm</i>); (6) Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhiṣṭhira that when he met the Kauravas he would try to keep the agitated Kurus and Sṛñjayas away from the noose of death (<i>mocayeyaṃ mṛtyupāśāt saṃrab-</i> <i>dhān kurusṛñjayān</i>) 5. 70. 81; (7) Before Kṛṣṇa left to meet the Kauravas, Draupadī told him that the Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas would be able to face the army of Kauravas (<i>śakṣyanti hi mahābāho</i> <i>pāṇḍavāḥ sṛñjayaiḥ saha / dhārtarāṣṭra-</i> <i>balaṃ … pratisamāsitum</i>) 5. 80. 11 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 82. 11: <i>pratisamāsituṃ</i> <i>pratipakṣatayā sthātum</i>); according to her, severe punishment should be quickly inflicted on Kauravas by Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Kṛṣṇa; he should take care to see that he, along with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas, was not blamed for not killing one who deserved to be killed 5. 80. 14, 18-19; (8) Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura that he would attempt to bring about reconciliation between Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would otherwise perish in war (<i>saṃgrāme vina-</i> <i>śiṣyatām</i>) 5. 91. 8; (9) Duryodhana wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong did the Kauravas do to Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas or for what fault of Kauravas did they want to kill Kauravas (<i>kim asmā-</i> <i>bhiḥ kṛtaṃ teṣāṃ kasmin vā punar āgasi</i>) 5. 125. 11; (10) When Ulūka was asked by Yudhiṣṭhira to convey to the assembly the view of Duryodhana, he spoke to them who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas 5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that in case of war Droṇa would kill Sṛñjayas (<i>gacched antaṃ sṛñjayānām</i>) 5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the war, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana to protect Bhīṣma so that he might kill Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; seeing Bhīṣma at the head of the Kaurava army, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, shivered (<i>samakampanta pāṇḍavāḥ / sṛñjayāś ca</i> <i> … dhṛṣṭadyumnapurogamāḥ //</i>) 6. 16. 42; (13) On the third day of the war, due to the quickness of Bhīṣma's action, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas felt that there were many hundreds and thousands of him (<i>aneka-</i> <i>śatasāhasram samapaśyanta lāghavāt</i>) 6. 55. 22 (also cf. st. 21); (14) On the fourth day, at one stage, Kurus and Sṛñjayas watched the duel between Bhīṣma and Arjuna 6. 56. 28; (15) On the fifth day, towards midday (<i>madhyandinagate sūrye</i> 6. 68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle with Kurus in which arrows, <i>śaktis, tomaras</i> were used 6. 68. 15-16; the battle described 18-19; the same day, later, Sṛñjayas, when they lost their armours, and their chariots were broken and bows were cut off, and their hair dishevelled, they wrestled with Kurus (<i>bāhubhiḥ samayudhyanta</i>) 6. 69. 39; when the sun was about to set (<i>sūrye 'stam upagacchati</i> 6. 70. 34), and when the stopping of the war was declared, Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas, went to their camps 6. 70. 37; (16) On the sixth day, when Bhīṣma and Droṇa started killing the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas fied (<i>palāyanaparābhavan</i>) 6. 71. 32; (17) On the seventh day, when Bhīṣma attacked Yudhiṣṭhira, Sṛñjayas riding chariots, elephants and horses trembled for they feared Yudhiṣṭhira would soon be killed (<i>sarathanāgāśvāḥ samakampanta sṛñjayāḥ</i>) 6. 82. 2-3; later in the afternoon (<i>aparāṃ</i> <i>diśam āsthāya sthite savitari</i> 6. 82. 28) Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikhaṇḍin and attacked Sṛñjayas; they were happy to face Bhīṣma (<i>sṛñjayās tu tato</i> <i>hṛṣṭā … </i>) and raised loud roars and blew their conches; a fierce battle followed in which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28; (18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñjayas not directly mentioned, only Pāñcālas are mentioned); Bhīṣma cut off arms and heads of those riding horses and elephants and deprived the chariot-fighters of their chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84. 3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their army; the Kṣatriyas rolled on the ground like those afflicted by ailments; their cry was like one of those who become lean due to hunger (<i>viveṣṭantaḥ sma dṛśyante</i> <i>vyādhikliṣṭā narā iva // … aniśaṃ śrūyate</i> <i>śabdaḥ kṣutkṛśānāṃ nṛṇām iva //</i>) 6. 85. 20-23; after the death of Irāvant, there was fierce fighting in which the Kaurava army and Sṛñjayas, not caring for their lives in battle, killed one another; with their hair loose and without their armours, when they were deprived of their chariots and their bows were cut off they wrestled with one another (<i>juhvataḥ samare</i> <i>prāṇān nijaghnur itaretaram // muktakeśā</i> <i>vikavacā virathāś chinnakārmukāḥ / bāhu-</i> <i>bhiḥ samayudhyanta samavetāḥ paraspa-</i> <i>ram //</i>) 6. 86. 76-77; when Bhagadatta proceeded to attack Yudhiṣṭhira, he fought a severe battle with Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas who were ready to fight with their weapons (<i>udyatāyudhaiḥ</i>) 6. 91. 79-80; Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that since he had dug up enmity with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas he should fight with them manfully; he himself also would kill Somakas and Pāñcālas (which term includes Sṛñjayas) (<i>yudhyasva</i> <i>tān adya raṇe … puruṣo bhava</i>) 6. 94. 1315; (19) At the end of the ninth day, it appeared that Bhīṣma had defeated Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; so at the start of the night (<i>rātrimukhe</i>) Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and Sṛñjayas held consultation (<i>mantrāya</i> <i>samupāviśan</i>) 6. 103. 8, 10-11; (20) At the start of the tenth day, Kaurava army was being destroyed by the sharp arrows of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; hence, Bhīṣma, not caring for life, attacked them 6. 104. 23, 26, 29; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how on the tenth day Bhīṣma, when attacked by Śikhaṇḍin determined to kill him (6. 104. 45-46), fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas (<i>daśame 'hani</i>) 6. 105. 3; when Bhīṣma began to destroy the Pāṇḍava army, the great chariot-fighters (<i>mahārathāḥ</i>) of Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma to kill him (<i>vadhāyābhyadravan bhīṣmam</i>) 6. 105. 35; as the war advanced Pāṇḍavas, backed by Sṛñjayas (<i>saṃhatāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ</i>), attacked Bhīṣma 6. 110. 40; Dhṛtarāṣṭra once again asked Saṃjaya how Bhīṣma fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas on the tenth day 6. 111. 1; as advised by Bhīṣma, Arjuna led Sṛñjayas (and Pāñcālas) to attack Bhīṣma and kill him; Sṛñjayas were asked to attack Bhīṣma without fear as they would be protected by Bhīma and Arjuna 6. 111. 15-20; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma showering weapons on him (<i>śastravṛṣṭyā</i>); angered Bhīṣma fought with them 6. 113. 16-18; the weapons used by Sṛñjayas are detailed in 6. 114. 2-3; Sṛñjayas and Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 101; at the end of the tenth day when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he wondered who could be the warriors who surrounded Bhīṣma (<i>ke vīrāḥ paryavārayan</i>) while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas; he also wished to know who from among the Kauravas were on the left side of the wheel of Bhīṣma and shot arrows on Sṛñjayas (<i>vāme cakre vartamānāḥ</i> <i>ke 'ghnan saṃjaya sṛñjayān</i>) 6. 15. 25, 28, 32; (21) On hearing the death of Bhīṣma (7. 2. 1), Karṇa admitted that the army which included Pāṇḍavas, Sātyaki, Kṛṣṇa and Sṛñjayas was invincible by kings; 7. 2. 31; (22) On the eleventh day, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas met with arrows Droṇa's attack on them; Droṇa broke and scattered their army; agitated by the arrows of Droṇa, they were again and again scattered by him (<i>te kampyamānā droṇena</i> <i>bāṇaiḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ / punaḥ punar abha-</i> <i>jyanta</i>) 7. 6. 33, 35, 41; Sṛñjayas, though they tried, were not able to kill the army of Droṇa as it was protected by him; since Droṇa was acting very swiftly, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas felt as if there were many Droṇas (<i>ekam āśukāriṇam āhave / anekam iva</i> <i>saṃtrāsān menire</i>) 7. 12. 19, 23; Sṛñjayas trembled seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of Pāṇḍavas (<i>sākṣād agnim ivo-</i> <i>tthitam</i>) 7. 13. 2; Sṛñjayas and others with their weapons raised (<i>udyatāyudhāḥ</i>) met the attack of Aśvasena and others; a fierce battle ensued 7. 15. 11-12; at the sunset when the withdrawal of the Pāṇḍava army was declared by Arjuna (<i>svāny anīkāni … </i> <i>avahārayat</i>), Sṛñjayas greeted him for his deeds during the day 7. 15. 49-50; (23) On the twelfth day, after killing Śatānīka, Droṇa repeatedly defeated Sṛñjayas and others; seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas trembled; due to the heroism of Droṇa, a river carrying the bodies of Kurus and Pāñcālas to the god of death began to flow (<i>nadīm antaka-</i> <i>gāminīm</i>) 7. 20. 23-24, 34, 36; when Droṇa killed a Pāñcāla prince, Sṛñjayas and others attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill Droṇa’ (<i>hata droṇaṃ hata droṇam ity</i> <i>āsīt tumulaṃ mahat /</i>); but Droṇa agitated them who were very angry 7. 20. 48-49; when Sṛñjayas and others were agitated and were pushed back (<i>calitān … praṇunnān</i>) by the arrows of Droṇa, Kauravas raised a loud roar 7. 21. 7-8; Duryodhana drew attention of Karṇa towards Bhīma who was deserted by Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas (<i>hīnaḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayaiḥ</i>) 7. 21. 16; (24) On the thirteenth day, Pāñcāla army which included thousands of Sṛñjayas attacked Droṇa; but Droṇa arrested their advance with arrows; then Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas did not attack him 7. 34. 5-7, 10; when Abhimanyu defeated Duḥśāsana, Sṛñjayas and others were delighted 7. 39. 11, 17-18; when Subhadrā heard the death of Abhimanyu, she pitied Sṛñjayas and the rest who did not seem to know when Abhimanyu was felled down (<i>dhik kekayāṃs … </i> <i>sṛñjayān / ye tvā raṇe gataṃ vīraṃ na</i> <i>jānanti nipātitam</i>) 7. 55. 13; (25) On the fourteenth day, Sātyaki shot arrows at Droṇa who was as though swallowing (<i>grasantam iva</i>) Sṛñjayas 7. 72. 34; the demon Alambusa made a river flow on the battle-field carrying the dead bodies of Sṛñjayas and others (<i>nadīṃ pravartayām</i> <i>āsa</i>) 7. 83. 30; when the Pāṇḍava army, which included Sṛñjayas, attacked Droṇa there was a loud roar among the Sṛñjayas (<i>tatrārāvo mahān āsīt</i>); when Droṇa started killing them, Sṛñjayas found no protector 7. 85. 20, 26; Yudhiṣṭhira assured Sātyaki that when he (Sātyaki) would leave to assist Arjuna, Sṛñjayas and others would be there to protect him (Yudhiṣṭhira) 7. 86. 45; Sṛñjayas and others, thrilled, rushed at Droṇa to fight with him with all their might (<i>sarvaśaktyā</i>); but Droṇa killed them 7. 101. 50-52; Droṇa asked Duryodhana to go to help Jayadratha; he himself would obstruct the onward march of Sṛñjayas and others 7. 105. 21; (26) After the death of Jayadratha, before the start of the night war between the fourteenth and fifteenth day, Droṇa pointed out to Duryodhana the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas marching towards him (Droṇa) 7. 126. 31; he directed Duryodhana to hold back his army if he could, for Kurus and Sṛñjayas would continue to fight even during the night; with these words, Droṇa marched against Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas (<i>tvaṃ</i> <i>ca duryodhana balaṃ yadi śaknoṣi dhāraya</i>) 7. 126. 38-39; then, there was fierce fighting in the evening (<i>saṃdhyāyām</i>) all around between Droṇa and Sṛñjayas 7. 129. 18; when the fierce fighting progressed during the night, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas together attacked Droṇa (<i>rātriyuddhe tathā ghore</i> <i>vartamāne sudāruṇe</i>); Droṇa forced all of them back killing some of them (<i>tān</i> <i>sarvān vimukhāṃś cakre kāṃścin ninye</i> <i>yamakṣayam</i>) 7. 129. 34-35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how did Kauravas feel when Droṇa entered the (army of) Sṛñjayas (<i>kā vo 'bhūd vai matis tadā</i>) 7. 130. 1; Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas followed Bhīma and Arjuna who showered arrows on Droṇa trying to scatter the army of Drupada with Vāyavyāstra 7. 132. 37, 41; 7. 136. 14; Aśvatthāman challenged his opponents to attack him and then killed Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas; they abandoned Aśvatthāman and fled in all directions (<i>vyadravanta diśo daśa</i> 7. 135. 19) when their chariots and banners were scattered (<i>viprakīrṇarathadhvajāḥ</i>) 7. 135. 51; Duryodhana asked Duḥśāsana and his other brothers to offer protection to Droṇa who would then kill Sṛñjayas and their kings (<i>sṛñjayāṃś ca sarājakān</i>); when all Sṛñjayas were killed, Aśvatthāman would kill Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 139. 24-25; in the fighting that followed Aśvatthāman covered Drupada and Droṇa covered Sṛñjayas with smooth arrows (<i>chādayām āsatuḥ</i> <i>saṃkhye śaraiḥ saṃnataparvabhiḥ</i>) 7. 139. 31; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas raised a loud roar (<i>siṃhanādaṃ praca-</i> <i>krire</i>) 7. 141. 32; considering that Bhīma had killed Duryodhana, Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and others made all effort to attack Droṇa to fight with him (<i>sarvodyogenābhijagmur</i> <i> … </i>); a fierce battle then was fought 7. 141. 60; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were being killed by Karṇa, they apprehended his presence nearby even when a blade of grass stirred (<i>tṛṇapraspandanāc cāpi sūta-</i> <i>putraṃ sma menire</i>) 7. 148. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 173. 19: <i>atibhayāt tṛṇacalana-</i> <i>mātreṇāpi karṇaṃ prāptaṃ menire</i>); they mistook a running warrior on their own side to be Karṇa (<i>api svaṃ samare yodhaṃ</i> <i>dhāvamānaṃ vicetasaḥ / karṇam evābhya-</i> <i>manyanta … </i>); hence, afraid, they ran but Karṇa attacked them from behind (<i>pṛṣṭhato vikirañ śarān</i>) 7. 148. 15-17; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were excessively tormented by the Rākṣasas of Alāyudha they had no peace of mind (<i>na</i> <i>śāntiṃ lebhire tatra</i>) 7. 152. 31; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wondered why Karṇa, instead of killing Ghaṭotkaca, did not kill Arjuna with the <i>śakti</i> given to him by Indra; for, the death of Arjuna would have meant the death of all Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas long ago 7. 157. 2; the same opinion was held by Kṛṣṇa (and hence he deluded the mind of Karṇa whenever he faced Arjuna) 7. 157. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how did Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas with their armies arrayed and in striking position (<i>vyūḍhānī-</i> <i>kāḥ prahāriṇaḥ</i>) fight with Kurus and how did they attack Droṇa who, not caring for his life, had plunged into their army after the death of Ghaṭotkaca (<i>jīvitaṃ tyaktvā</i> <i>gāhamānaṃ varūthinīm</i>) 7. 158. 13-15; Droṇa killed three grand-sons of Drupada and then defeated Cedis, Kekayas, Sṛñjayas and Matsyas 7. 161. 31-32; (27) On the fifteenth day, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas, although they were being killed by Droṇa, attacked him and confused him (<i>mohayanto</i> <i>mahāratham</i>) 7. 164. 60; after killing Vasudāna (king of Pāṃśurāṣṭra), Droṇa killed six thousand Sṛñjayas 7. 164. 85; exhorted by Yudhiṣṭhira to assist Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the great chariot-fighters of Sṛñjayas attacked Droṇa in order to kill him; Droṇa with great speed moved against them not minding his death (<i>martavyam iti niścitaḥ</i>); bad omens occurred; Droṇa, encircled by the armies of Drupada, moved burning host of Kṣatriyas and killed a very large number of them 7. 165. 8-16; when ultimately Droṇa was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas attacked the disheartened Kurus with the result that their army was shattered (<i>nirutsāhān kurūn</i> <i> … abhyadravan … tataḥ sainyaṃ vyadīr-</i> <i>yata</i>) 7. 165. 58; when Aśvatthāman used his <i>nārāyaṇāstra,</i> Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were dismayed to see the mid-region filled with different weapons (<i>śastrākṛtibhir ākīrṇam atīva … dṛṣṭvā-</i> <i>ntarikṣam āvignāḥ pāṇḍupāñcālasṛñjayāḥ</i>) 7. 170. 20; at the end of the day, when Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Droṇa, he asked Saṃjaya what was Droṇa doing on the battle-field when Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas managed to kill him (<i>kiṃ kurvāṇaṃ raṇe droṇam</i> <i>jaghnuḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ</i>) 7. 8. 1; Saṃjaya assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that since he was an eye-witness to the whole event (<i>sarvaṃ</i> <i>pratyakṣadarśivān</i>) he would narrate to him how Droṇa fell when overpowered (<i>sāditaḥ</i>) by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 7. 11. 1; (28) On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana was confident that with Karṇa as their general Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas would loose their consciousness (<i>gatacetasaḥ</i>) 8. 6. 31; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa, as intended by Aśvatthāman (<i>aśva-</i> <i>tthāmanaś ca saṃkalpād … </i>) had killed Sṛñjayas 8. 16. 5; Karṇa brought Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas within the range of his arrows and crushed them (<i>śaragocaram ānayat /</i> <i>mamarda</i>); Kurus, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas fought with great effort not caring for their life (<i>vyāyacchamānāḥ subhṛśam … </i> <i>priyān asūn raṇe tyaktvā</i>) 8. 16. 22, 2425; battle described 8. 16. 26-38; at midday (<i>madhyaṃ gate dinakare</i> 8. 17. 100), although Karṇa killed Sṛñjayas they attacked him 8. 17. 117; (29) On the seventeenth day, early morning (<i>prabhātāyāṃ</i> <i>rajanyāṃ tu</i> 8. 22. 29) before the start of the war, Duryodhana while requesting Śalya to act as a charioteer of Karṇa told him that with a good charioteer like him, Karṇa would be able to destroy Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; at the start of the war on that day, Pāñcālas, Cedis and Sṛñjayas fought a fierce battle with the Kaurava army 8. 32. 15; Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had boasted earlier that he alone would kill Sṛñjayas along with Pāṇḍavas 8. 35. 2; Sṛñjayas cut off (<i>śātayām āsuḥ</i>) the arrows shot at them by Kṛpa 8. 38. 4; Karṇa stopped the onward march of Sṛñjayas and others who were led by Bhīma 8. 38. 16; Karṇa killed Cedis, Karūṣas and Sṛñjayas in the presence of Bhīma; when Bhīma left Karṇa to fight with the Kuru army, Karṇa killed thousands of great archers of Sṛñjayas (<i>sṛñ-</i> <i>jayāṃś ca maheśvāsān nijaghāna sahasra-</i> <i>śaḥ</i>) 8. 40. 2-4; Sṛñjayas were ‘burnt’ by the fire in the form of Karṇa (<i>karṇāgninā</i> <i> … dagdhā … </i>) 8. 40. 61; Arjuna pointed out to Kṛṣṇa that the large army of Sṛñjayas was being scattered (<i>dīryate</i>) by Karṇa 8. 40. 81; when Bhīma returned to fight (<i>saṃnivṛtto raṇaṃ prati</i>), Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed him 8. 41. 3; Kurus led by Karṇa and Sṛñjayas led by Yudhiṣṭhira faced one another without fear (<i>abhītāḥ</i>) 8. 42. 1; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa, after defeating Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas was looking for Arjuna: when the Kuru warriors saw Karṇa displaying his valour by harassing Pāṇḍavas and thousands of Sṛñjayas they raised a loud roar (<i>nadanti</i>); Karṇa encouraged Kaurava warriors to attack Sṛñjayas so that none of them escaped alive (<i>yathā jivan</i> <i>na vaḥ kaścin mucyate</i>) 8. 43. 36; Kṛṣṇa was glad to point out to Arjuna that Bhīma, along with Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas, had once again returned to the battle-field 8. 43. 52; Yudhiṣṭhira wondered whether the encounter of Sṛñjayas and Kauravas in which he was humiliated had become known to the fighters (<i>kaccit saṃgrāme vidito vā</i> <i>tadāyaṃ samāgamaḥ sṛñjayakauravā-</i> <i>ṇām / yatrāvasthām īdṛśīṃ prāpito 'ham</i>) 8. 46. 41; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that all Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with their followers were prepared to fight when they had resorted to him (<i>ete ca sarve pāñcālāḥ</i> <i>sṛñjayāś ca sahānvayāḥ / tvāṃ samāsādya</i> <i> … vyavasthitāḥ</i>) 8. 51. 5; while taking stock of some of the events of the battle which had lasted for seventeen days (<i>adya</i> <i>saptadaśāhāni</i> 8. 51. 2), Kṛṣṇa reminded Arjuna that while Bhīṣma was fighting, Sṛñjayas were unable to look at him; Bhīṣma routed Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas and distinguished himself as the sole war hero (<i>ekavīratvam āgataḥ</i>) 8. 51. 35; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Bhīma, covered on all sides by Sṛñjayas, was being tormented while fighting with Karṇa: if Karṇa was neglected he might kill Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas 8. 51. 105-106; at one stage in the battle, Uttamaujas had engaged Sṛñjayas 8. 53. 6; Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards Karṇa, lest he destroyed all Sṛñjaya great chariot-fighters in battle in their presence (<i>rādheyo 'py anyathā pārthān</i> <i>sṛñjayāṃś ca mahārathān / niḥśeṣān</i> <i>samare kuryāt paśyator nau janārdana //</i>) 8. 57. 8; later, Kuru warriors and Sṛñjayas fought with one another using straightflying and very sharp arrows (<i>śarais</i> <i>tadāñjogatibhiḥ sutejanaiḥ</i>) 8. 57. 67; once again a very severe fighting broke out between Kurus and Sṛñjayas in which they used besides arrows weapons like swords, <i>śaktis,</i> lances, maces and <i>paraśvadhas</i> 8. 62. 40; when Karṇa was killed, Arjuna was honoured by Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others 8. 69. 37; on the seventeenth night (<i>niśi</i> 8. 1. 25) while reporting Karṇa's death to Dhṛtarāṣṭra Saṃjaya told him that Karṇa, before his death, had killed Kekayas and Videhas in the presence of all Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas (<i>sa sṛñjayānāṃ sarveṣāṃ</i> <i>pāñcālānāṃ ca paśyatām / kekayānāṃ</i> <i>videhānām akarot kadanaṃ mahat //</i>) 8. 2. 18; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya who among the Kurus and Sṛñjayas were dead and who were alive 8. 4. 3; (30) On the eighteenth day, when Śalya became the general the Madras encouraged him saying that he was capable of defeating in battle even gods and demons, let alone mortals like Somakas and Sṛñjayas 9. 6. 9; a fierce battle was fought by Sṛñjayas with Kurus which terrorized Kurus (<i>kurūṇāṃ bhayavardha-</i> <i>nam</i>) 9. 8. 1; as a result of the battle there began to flow a terrific river (<i>nadī</i> <i>raudrā</i>) filled with the bodies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas (<i>kurusṛñjayasaṃkulā</i>) 9. 8. 32; seeing the heroic deeds (<i>vikramam</i>) of Śalya, Duryodhana considered Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas (as good as) dead (<i>nihatān … mene</i>) 9. 12. 28; finally, when Śalya was killed, Pāṇḍavas and Śṛñjayas chased the shattered (<i>prabhagnān</i>) army of Kauravas 9. 18. 28; when Śālva, riding an elephant, attacked the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and others thought his swiftly moving single elephant, to be several thousands (<i>sahasraśo vai vicarantam</i> <i>ekam</i>) 9. 19. 6; when the Pāṇḍava army was broken, Kaurava heroes blew, in joy, their conches; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the general of the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas, could not bear the sound of the roar indicative of the joy of Kauravas (8. 19. 10); seeing the (heroic) deeds of Śālva, Sṛñjayas and others encircled his elephant 9. 19. 21; during the war of eighteen days eleven <i>akṣauhiṇis</i> of Duryodhana's army were killed by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 9. 28. 14; Duryodhana felt confident to defeat Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with mace as his weapon 9. 31. 30; Bhīma told Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by Sṛñjayas (<i>sṛñjayaiḥ saha tiṣṭhantam</i>), that he was prepared to accept the challenge of Duryodhana 9. 32. 28; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas applauded Duryodhana's words asking Bhīma to prove his words (<i>darśayasva</i> <i>balaṃ yuddhe</i>) 9. 32. 49-50; when Balarāma came to witness the duel between Bhīma and Duryodhana, he embraced Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas and enquired about their well being (<i>apṛcchat kuśalaṃ sarvān</i>) 9. 33. 11; Duryodhana asked Yudhiṣṭhira, along with Sṛñjayas, to watch the duel 9. 54. 38-39; when Duryodhana was forced to kneel down by Bhīma, Sṛñjayas raised a loud roar; hearing their roar, Duryodhana was enraged 9. 56. 54-55; when Bhīma felled down Duryodhana he told Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas that he had killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra on the strength of Draupadī's <i>tapas (raṇe</i> <i>hatāṃs tapasā yājñasenyāḥ)</i> 9. 58. 9-10; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya what did the Sṛñjayas do when Duryodhana was struck down; Saṃjaya told him that they waived their upper garments and raised a loud roar; the earth was unable to bear them who were filled with delight (<i>āvidhyan</i> <i>uttarīyāṇi siṃhanādāṃś ca nedire / naitān</i> <i>harṣasamāviṣṭān iyam sehe vasundharā //</i>) 9. 60. 3-4; some shook their bows, others their bow-strings; still others blew their large conches or struck the <i>dundubhis;</i> some made sportive gestures, others laughed (<i>cikrīḍus tathaivānye jahasuś ca</i>) 9. 60. 5-6; they praised Bhīma's act in so many words and were happy that he had brought the enmity to an end (<i>vairasya ca gataḥ</i> <i>pāram</i>); they said that the horripilation experienced by them at the time of Duryodhana's fall had not yet subsided (<i>duryo-</i> <i>dhanavadhe yāni romāṇī hṛṣitāni naḥ / adyāpi</i> <i>na vihṛṣyanti tāni … </i>) 9. 60. 7-16; Kṛṣṇa told Sṛñjayas not to rebuke Duryodhana anymore because he was already killed when he refused to give Pāṇḍavas their share although advised to do that, among others, by them (<i>°gāṅgevasṛñjayaiḥ / … procya-</i> <i>māno 'pi</i>) 9. 60. 20; (31) During the massacre which took place at night of the eighteenth day, Aśvatthāman killed Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas who were without weapons and armours and were agitated (<i>apetaśastrasaṃnāhān saṃrabdhān pāṇḍu-</i> <i>sṛñjayān</i>) 10. 8. 74; Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told Aśvatthāman that they had killed Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas by thousands (as they were trying to escape from the camp) (<i>vinikṛttān sahasraśaḥ</i>) 10. 8. 141; (32) More than a hundred Sṛñjayas (<i>sṛñjayāṃś</i> <i>ca śatādhikān</i>) were put on the funeral pyre along with the dead bodies of other fallen heroes and were cremated according to the prescribed rites 11. 26. 30, 33, 38. <b>C.</b> Some person referred to as Sṛñjayas which indicated their relationship with them: (1) Dhṛṣṭadyumna 3. 34. 12 (cf. 3. 23. 46); (2) Hotravāhana (father of Ambā's mother) 5. 175. 7, 12, 28; 5. 176. 4, 17, 20, 26; (3) Vainya, one of the ancient kings 1. 1. 166."

Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) <b>Daivavāta</b> is celebrated as victorious over the <b>Turvaśas</b> and the <b>Vṛcī-</b> <b>vants,</b><sup>1</sup> and his sacrificial fire is referred to.<sup>2</sup> In connexion with Daivavāta is also mentioned <b>Sāhadevya Somaka,</b><sup>3</sup> no doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> we find Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally <b>Suplan</b>) Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by <b>Parvata</b> and <b>Nārada.</b> The Rigveda<sup>5</sup> has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) of <b>Prastoka,</b><sup>6</sup> a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with <b>Divodāsa.</b> Moreover, <b>Vītahavya</b><sup>7</sup> seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though Zimmer<sup>8</sup> prefers to take the derivative word, <b>Vaitahavya,</b> not as a patronymic, but as an epithet. <dvsn n='P'/>It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the <b>Tṛtsus</b> were closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated together,<sup>9</sup> and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.<sup>10</sup> This view is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> which recognizes <b>Devabhāga Śrautarṣa</b> as Purohita of the <b>Kurus</b> and the Sṛñjayas. <dvsn n='P'/>On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas, at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup> to have offended the <b>Bhṛgus</b> and to have ended miserably. There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>13</sup> and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>14</sup> in independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their disobedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this allusion. <dvsn n='P'/>The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain. Hillebrandt<sup>15</sup> suggests that in early times they must be looked for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the <lang n='greek'>Σαράγγαι</lang><sup>16</sup> of the Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer<sup>17</sup> is inclined to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the <b>Madhyadeśa,</b> and were certainly absorbed in the Kurus. <dvsn n='P'/>Of the history of this clan we have one notice.<sup>18</sup> They expelled <b>Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana,</b> one of their kings, from the hereditary monarchy — of ten generations — and also drove out <b>Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,</b> probably his minister, who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, <b>Balhika</b> <b>Prātīpya.</b> Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,<sup>19</sup> as a defeat of the Sṛñjayas. <F>1) Rv. vi. 27, 7.</F> <F>2) Rv. iv. 15, 4.</F> <F>3) Rv. iv. 15, 7.</F> <F>4) vii. 34, 9.</F> <F>5) Rv. vi. 47, 22. 25.</F> <F>6) <i>Cf.</i> Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sutra, xvi. 11, 11.</F> <F>7) Oldenberg, <i>Zeitschrift der Deutschen</i> <i>Morgenländischen Gesellschaft,</i> 42, 212; Hillebrandt, <i>Vedische Mythologie,</i> 1, 105.</F> <F>8) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 132 (on <i>vaita-</i> <i>havya</i>).</F> <F>9) <i>Cf.</i> also the connexion of the <b>Bharad</b> <b>vājas</b> and Divodāsa (Rv. vi. 16, 5; 31, 4; Hillebrandt, <i>op. cit.,</i> 1, 104), and their connexion with the Sṛñjayas (Vītahavya in Rv. vi. 15, 2. 3, and see vi. 27, 7, both passages that can safely be accepted as derived from the Bharadvāja family).</F> <F>10) See, on the one hand, Rv. vii. 18 (Turvaśas and Tṛtsus), and, on the other, vi. 27, 7.</F> <F>11) ii. 4, 4, 5.</F> <F>12) v. 19, 1. <i>Cf.</i> v. 18, 10. 11.</F> <F>13) xii. 3.</F> <F>14) vi. 6, 2, 2, 3.</F> <F>15) <i>Op. cit.,</i> 1, 106.</F> <F>16) Herodotus has the form <lang n='greek'>Σαράγγαι</lang> and <lang n='greek'>Σαράγγεες</lang>, Strabo and Arrian <lang n='greek'>Δράγγαι</lang>.
