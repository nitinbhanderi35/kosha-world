If one or more of the five rites is done properly, the others wrongly, the delinquent remains impure and is called (successively) <b>yadbhūyaskālaka</b>, <i>mostly black</i>; <b>upārdhakālaka</b>, <i>half black</i>; <b>ekadeśakālaka</b>; and <b>pradeśakālaka</b>; if all are properly done, he is <i>pure</i>, <b>apagatakālaka</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab> In the virtual repetition, 〔p. 78〕, <b>pradeśakālakaḥ</b> is accidentally omitted, but <b>ekadeśakālakaḥ</b> (line 13) has the definition given above to pradeśa-k° (only one of the five rites being done wrongly), which seems likely to be right. The <ab>ms.</ab> several times writes -kālika for -kālaka."
