            "content": "[<b>Saṃvar(t)ta-Maruttīya</b>]¦ (“the tale of Saṃvartta and Marutta”): § 778<i>b</i> (Aśvamedh.).** <i>Vyāsa</i> said: In the <i>Kṛta</i> age <i>Manu</i> was the ruler; > <i>Prasandhi > Kṣupa</i> <i>> Ikṣvāku > Viṃśa</i> (the model bowman, the eldest of 100 brothers, all kings) <i>> Viviṃśa > Khanīnetra (c) > Suvarcas (d</i>) <i>Karandhama > Avikṣit (e) Kārandhama > Marutta</i> (who surpassed his father, had the strength of 10,000 elephants, and was equal to <i>Viṣṇu</i>). Desirous of performing a sacrifice, <i>Marutta</i>, coming to <i>Meru</i>, on the northern side of <i>Himavat</i>, caused thousands of gold vessels to be forged; there on a huge golden hill he performed the rites along with other princes (XIV, <b>4</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa</i> said: As the offspring of <i>Prajāpati Dakṣa</i>, D. and As., challenged each other, so did <i>Aṅgiras'</i> sons <i>Bṛhaspati</i> and <i>Saṃvarta</i>; troubled by his elder brother <i>Saṃvarta</i> went naked to the woods. <i>Indra</i>, having vanquished the As., appointed Bṛh. as his priest. Formerly (read <i>pūrvaṃ</i> with B.) <i>Aṅgiras</i> was the family priest of king <i>Karandhama</i> (see <i>d</i>); so also of his son <i>Avikṣit</i> (equal to <i>Yayāti</i>). His son <i>Marutta</i> used to defy <i>Indra</i>, and <i>Indra</i> used to defy <i>Marutta</i>, but could not prevail over him. Then <i>Indra</i> took the promise from Bṛh. that he would not perform priestly offices for <i>Marutta</i> (“thou hast destroyed <i>Namuci, Viśvarūpa</i>, and <i>Bala</i>,” said Bṛh.). <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: Then <i>Indra</i> was cured for his envy and went home (XIV, <b>5</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> said: The ancient tale of the discourse between Bṛh. and <i>Marutta</i> is cited in this connection. <i>Marutta</i> in vain tried to persuade Bṛh. to officiate at his sacrifice (which Bṛh. had himself formerly proposed); D. ṛ. (M.-ṛ.) <i>Nārada</i> told him to apply to <i>Saṃvarta</i>, who now, desirous of seeing <i>Maheśvara</i>, wandered about in <i>Vārāṇasī</i> in the garb of a madman; “having reached the gate of that city, thou must place a dead body somewhere near it, and the man who shall turn away on seeing the corpse, do thou know that man to be <i>Saṃvarta</i>; if he should ask thee to follow me,” said <i>Nārada</i>, “thou mayst even tell him without hesitation that I have ascended the pyre.” <i>Vyāsa</i> said: “By acting thus, <i>Marutta</i> found <i>Saṃvarta</i> in a lonely place; <i>Saṃvarta</i> covered him with mud and ashes and phlegm and spittle. At last he sat down under a <i>nyagrodha</i> tree” (XIV, <b>6</b>). <i>Marutta</i> told him the matter (also that <i>Nārada</i> had mounted the pyre); <i>Saṃvarta</i> then, as a lunatic, scolding <i>Marutta</i> repeatedly with harsh words, told him to go to Bṛh. first (as his elder brother), and taking Bṛh.'s permission he might come back. As <i>Marutta</i> said that he had already been repulsed by Bṛh., and that he now desired to sacrifice even with all his goods in order to outstrip <i>Indra, Saṃvarta</i> consented, if <i>Marutta</i> would agree to do all that <i>Saṃvarta</i> would ask him to do, as Bṛh. and <i>Indra</i> were certain to do all they could to injure <i>Marutta. Marutta</i> took an oath to this. <i>Saṃvarta</i> said that <i>Marutta</i> would surpass <i>Indra</i>, D., and G.; he himself had no desire for wealth, but would only do what was disagreeable to <i>Indra</i> and Bṛh. (XIV, <b>7</b>). <i>Saṃvarta</i> said: There is a peak <i>Muñjavat (f</i>) on the <i>Himālaya</i>, where <i>Śiva</i> is constantly engaged in austerities; go thither and appease <i>Śiva</i>, whose names are <i>Śarva</i>, etc. (α); then thou shalt acquire that gold. <i>Marutta</i> acted accordingly; Bṛh. became sick from envy; <i>Indra</i> with D. came (XIV, <b>8</b>) and was told about the matter (“prosperity of a rival is always painful, and for this reason thou with D. persecutest As. and kills them”). He despatched <i>Agni (g</i>) to <i>Marutta</i>, asking him to let Bṛh. officiate as his priest instead of <i>Saṃvarta</i>, promising him the greatest rewards (“such as the highest regions created by <i>Prajāpati</i> and even the whole kingdom of the gods”); <i>Saṃvarta</i> threatened to burn <i>Agni</i> with his fearful eye, if he ever came again on such an errand. <i>Agni</i> was frightened and returned to <i>Indra</i> and Bṛh. and said that <i>Marutta</i> had refused and did not care for his promises. <i>Indra</i> asked <i>Agni</i> to return to <i>Marutta</i>, and threatened him with <i>Indra's</i> thunderbolt if he did not obey; <i>Agni</i>, afraid of <i>Saṃvarta</i>, suggested that the G. king should go; <i>Indra</i> said that nobody could burn <i>Agni; Agni</i> asked why then <i>Vṛtra</i> could deprive <i>Indra</i> of the sovereignty of Heaven; <i>Indra</i>, mentioning his victories over the <i>Kālakeyas</i>, Dā., and <i>Prahlāda</i>, said that it was because he did not accept <i>soma</i> from a foe, nor strike the weak with his thunderbolt; <i>Agni</i> reminded him of <i>Cyavana</i> at <i>Śaryāti's</i> sacrifice and the creation of <i>Mada</i> (description): “the might of brahmans is greater than that of kṣatriyas” (XIV, <b>9</b>). Then <i>Indra</i> sent G. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> on the same errand, but in vain. <i>Vyāsa</i> said: As the clouds indicated that <i>Indra</i> must be near, <i>Marutta</i> repaired to <i>Saṃvarta</i>, who comforted him, saying that <i>Agni</i> would protect him, and that he would himself dispel the thunder by the winds, and granted him the boon that <i>Indra</i> should come in person to his sacrifice and accept the oblations offered to him, and so should all the gods. And so it happened by the power of <i>Saṃvarta's</i> incantations. Requested by <i>Saṃvarta, Indra</i> himself gave directions to all the gods to erect a hall of assembly: 1,000 well-furnished rooms with a durable staircase for the ascent of G. and Aps., and to furnish that portion of the sacrificial ground reserved for the dance of Aps., like unto the palace of <i>Indra</i> in heaven; <i>Indra</i> said that <i>Marutta's</i> ancestors and the gods had been highly pleased, and told him to offer a red bull to <i>Agni</i>, and a blue bull with a variegated skin to V.-D. Then <i>Indra</i> and the gods returned home. <i>Marutta</i> placed heaps of gold on various spots and distributed immense wealth to the brahmans."
