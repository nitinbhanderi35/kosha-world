That day Māṇḍavya cursed him saying “You will also be beaten like this by a brave monkey”. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa). (More details can be had from the entry Aṇīmāṇḍavya). The āśrama of Māṇḍavya is considered a holy place. Once the King of Kāśī went to this āśrama and performed severe penance there. (Chapter 186, Udyoga Parva)."
