This woman saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa on his way to the palace of his uncle Kaṃsa in Mathurāpurī. Even at the first sight she felt a great respect and devotion towards Kṛṣṇa and she gave him the scented cosmetics she was carrying to Kaṃsa. Kṛṣṇa placed a foot of his on hers and holding her chin by both the hands raised it up and lo! she stood straight without her hunch. She requested Kṛṣṇa to stay with her that night but Kṛṣṇa left her saying he would stay with her on another day which he did the next day itself. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata)."
