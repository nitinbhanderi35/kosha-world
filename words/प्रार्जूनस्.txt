Vincent Smith<sup>392</sup> places the Prārjūnas in the Narasiṃhapur district of the Central Provinces, but a more plausible location is Narasiṃhagarh in Central India,<sup>393</sup> as much as three other tribes which are coupled with Prārjūnas, the Sanakānīkas, Kākas and Kharaparikas, seem to have occupied regions more or less within the bounds of Central India<sup>394</sup> The tribe, associated with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and north-west before the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>395</sup> Kauṭilya knows of a people called <i>Prājjunaka (Prārjunaka).</i><sup>396</sup>"
