This fierce giant was killed by Indra. There is a story in the Purāṇas describing how Namuci was killed. <dvsn n='NI'/>Under the leadership of Namuci a great army of the giants invaded the realm of the gods. Indra came with an army of devas. Though the giants were defeated in the battle Indra was not able to kill Namuci. To save himself from the attack of Indra, Namuci got into the radiance of the Sun and hid himself there. Indra found him out and made a treaty with him, the conditions of which were as said by Indra:— <dvsn n='NI'/>“Oh, noble giant, I will not kill you by wet thing or dry thing, in the night or in the day. What I say is true.” <dvsn n='NI'/>According to this treaty it became impossible for Indra to kill Namuci either with wet things or with dry things and either in the day time or in the night. Only when Indra had agreed to these conditions did Namuci come out. <dvsn n='NI'/>The battle continued and Indra drove away Śumbha and Niśumbha the elder brothers of Namuci, who went to Pātāla. Indra ran after Namuci and in the evening Indra found him hiding on the sea shore and killed him with the foam of the sea. As Indra had violated the condition of the treaty the severed head of Namuci followed Indra. With this Indra incurred the sin of Brahmahatyā (killing a Brahmin). To get remission from this sin Indra approached Brahmā. He was advised to bathe in Aruṇāsaṅgama and doing so Indra got remission of his sin. From that day onwards Aruṇāsaṅgama became a holy bath (tīrtha). (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 40)."

Then by his magic and sorcery Namuci spread darkness everywhere. Indra defeated that strategy also. Then Namuci dashed forward and taking hold of the tusks of Airāvata shook Indra down. Indra stood up and cut off the head of Namuci with his sword. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa)."
