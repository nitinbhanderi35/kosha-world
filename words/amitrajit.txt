Nārada Muni who was delighted by this sight, went to the Palace and said to Amitrajit: “In the city of Campakāvatī there is a Gandharva virgin named Malayagandhinī. She has been abducted by Kaṅkālaketu, a Rākṣasa. She has promised to marry the person who will rescue her from him. Therefore please save her from the Rākṣasa.” As suggested by Nārada Amitrajit killed Kaṅkālaketu in battle and recovered Malayagandhinī and married her. Vīra was their son. (Skanda Purāṇa)."
