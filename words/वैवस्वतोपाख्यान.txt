Requested by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> said: The <i>maharṣi Manu, Vivasvat's</i> son, equal to <i>Prajāpati</i> (i.e. <i>Brahmán</i>), excelled his father and grandfather in strength, etc. He practised austerities in <i>Badarī</i>, standing on one foot, etc., for 10,000 years. Once a small fish came to him on the banks of the <i>Cīriṇī</i> and asked his protection from the greater fishes. He first reared it in a water vessel, and as it grew larger, he carried it to a large tank, and thence into the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, and at last into the ocean. The fish, saying that the world was about to be destroyed, caused him to build a strong ship with a long rope and ascend it with the seven <i>ṛṣis</i> and the seeds that were enumerated by the <i>brahmans</i> of old. The fish then appeared and was recognized by a horn, to which <i>Manu</i> tied the noose. And, while there was water everywhere, the fish dragged the boat through the flood for many years, until, advised by the fish, <i>Manu</i> tied the ship to the highest peak of <i>Himavat</i>, thence called <i>Naubandhana</i>. The fish told him that he was <i>Brahmán</i>, and caused <i>Manu</i> to create (again) by austerities all creatures with gods, <i>Asuras</i>, and men. This is the <i>Mātsyakaṃ Purāṇaṃ</i> (III, <b>187</b>)."
