Maṅki was an aspirant of worldly things and once he got two bullocks. He was ploughing with them one day when a camel came and carried them away. Disappointed he came to the āśrama and lamented deeply over it. This lamentation became known later as the famous Maṅkigītā. By the time the gītā reached its end the mind of the sage was changed and he became one bereft of all worldly desires and he acquired mokṣa. (Chapter 177, Śānti Parva)."

Both had no sons and as per the advice of his guru he went to Sabarmatītaṭa and did penance there. After several years of rigorous austerities he got very many children. The place where Maṅkimaharṣi sat and did penance was known later as Maṅkitīrtha. It is also called Saptasārasvata. In Dvāparayuga the Pāṇḍavas visited the place and gave it the name Saptadhāra also.
