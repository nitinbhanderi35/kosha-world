Having been directed by Vinatā to live upon the Niṣādas (<i>b</i>) but not to injure the brahmans, and being taught by her how to know who is a brahman, he set out, and, having come to the Niṣādas, he raised a great quantity of dust, and opened his mouth; there the Niṣādas entered by thousands, being blinded by the dust, and were devoured (I, <b>28</b>). A brahman who, with his wife of the Niṣāda caste, entered the throat of <i>G.</i>, and began to burn him, was recognized and relieved with his wife by <i>G</i>.

The Vālakhilyas therefore gave him the name Garuḍa (etymology: <i>guruṃ bhāraṃ samāsādyoḍḍīnaḥ</i>, v. 1390). On Gandhamādana he saw Kaśyapa engaged in ascetic devotions. Kaśyapa propitiated the Vālakhilyas (<i>c</i>) for him, then they abandoned the bough and went to Himavat to practise ascetic penances. According to the advice of Kaśyapa <i>G</i>. flew away for a hundred thousand of yojanas to a mountain without human beings, there he threw down the bough and ate the tortoise and the elephant.

Bṛhaspati declared that it was owing to the fault of Indra and the ascetic penances of the Vālakhilyas (cf. § 45) that <i>G</i>. now approached to take away the soma. Indra then caused the gods to surround and watch the amṛta (I, <b>30</b>).— § 45 (Vālakhilya, pl.): I, <b>31</b>, 1436, 1469, 1470 (by the penances of the Vālakhilyas <i>G</i>. had been born as the lord of winged creatures (<i>patatrīṇām indraḥ</i>, v. 1455)).—§ 46 (Āstīkap.): <i>G</i>. attacked the gods, whom he blinded with dust, and Bhaumana lay as dead on the field. Indra caused Vāyu to dispel the dust. The Sādhyas and the Gandharvas fled eastwards, the Vasus and the Rudras towards the south, the Ādityas towards the west, and the Aśvins towards the north. <i>G</i>. then slew nine Yakṣas, Aśvakranda, etc. (α), who guarded the amṛta. The amṛta on all sides was surrounded with fire. <i>G</i>. then divided his mouth into 8100 mouths, and taking water from many rivers he extinguished the fire. Then he assumed a diminutive body (I, <b>32</b>), and passed through the spokes of the revolving keen-edged wheel of steel placed before the soma. Then there were two great snakes, who would reduce to ashes everyone who might be seen by them. <i>G</i>. covered their eyes with dust, and unseen by them mangled them to pieces. He then flew away with the amṛta, not drinking it himself. He met with Viṣṇu on his way and they agreed that <i>G</i>. should stay above Viṣṇu, sitting on the flagstaff of his chariot and be his vehicle, and be immortal and free from disease without drinking amṛta. While <i>G</i>. was flying Indra hurled his thunderbolt at him. <i>G</i>. did not feel the slightest pain, but in honour of Dadhīca and Indra and the thunderbolt <i>G</i>. dropped a feather, and from its beauty he gained the name Suparṇa (I, <b>33</b>). Indra and <i>G</i>. made friendship with each other, and agreed that <i>G</i>. should not give the soma to anyone for drink. Indra should bring it away after it had been put down by <i>G.</i>, and <i>G</i>. should feed on the snakes. The snakes declared Vinatā to be free; <i>G</i>. placed down the soma on some kuśa grass, and while the snakes were performing their ablutions, their daily devotions, and other religious rites, Indra took up the amṛta and reṭurned to heaven.

mind-born (<i>saṃkalpaja</i>) son of Kaśyapa and Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vainateya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatāsūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39; 1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot (<i>sopas-</i> <i>veda bhāṇḍa</i>) for over a thousand years; as advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20; when the proper time came Garuḍa came out of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as soon as born he left the mother and flew up in the sky, from there to seek his destined food (serpents, hence <i>pannagasūdana</i>) 1. 14. 22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62; (1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra for gods who would be a hundred times more powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27. 8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajāpati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that the one to be born as a result of their sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1. 27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma 13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa was of big size (<i>mahākāyaḥ</i>), having blazing lustre and looking like a mass of kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni not to burn the people; they were informed by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa, Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa withdrew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14. <b>B.</b> Progeny: Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya) Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1; these six are thus the founders of the <i>vinatā-</i> <i>kula</i> 5. 99. 3. <b>C.</b> Eminence: Garuḍa compared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13. 14. 158; as the best among the birds he was counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6. 32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought highly of other birds whenever he confronted them 6. 4. 34. <b>D.</b> Bringer of <i>amṛta</i> (Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa approached his mother who, as the slave of Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean; at her instance Vainateya carried on his back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa carried them to a beautiful forest in an island, and from there to another island 1. 23. 1, 6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked serpents how his mother could be freed from slavery; serpents asked him to get <i>amṛta</i> for them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the time of his departure he was blessed by Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14; a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; <i>amṛta</i> 1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka, (an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise), both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25. 7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived in the south and used to fight with each other) with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25. 27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya 1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest of the living beings; they left the branch; Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch; as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited mountain covered with snow and there ate the elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as Garuḍa drew near the place of <i>amṛta,</i> there were bad omens for gods; when Indra enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26. 36-37 (called also <i>amṛta</i> 1. 26. 38); Bṛhaspati told the gods that Garuḍa was of incomparable strength and would achieve what was most difficult to achieve (<i>asādhyam api</i> <i>sādhayet</i>) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart 1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28. 20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were protecting <i>amṛta</i> (1. 28. 6), an with birds (<i>pakṣin</i>) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others; he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after the fight Garuḍa saw <i>amṛta</i> surrounded by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers, poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter the fire he became small in size 1. 28. 22-25; near the <i>amṛta</i> he saw a wheel of iron (<i>ayasmaya</i>), of sharp edge, which was a device (<i>yantra</i>) created by gods to cut down those who might try to steal Soma; as he entered through the spokes of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poison in their eyes (<i>cakṣurviṣau</i>), guarding <i>amṛta;</i> anyone seen by them would be reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya) snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with the force of his speed he uprooted (<i>unmath-</i>) the <i>yantra</i> 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not taste the <i>amṛta</i> but asked a boon from Viṣṇu that he should become undecaying and immortal without tasting <i>amṛta</i> 1. 29. 11, 14; without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa, as he was taking away <i>amṛta,</i> with his <i>vajra;</i> to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from whose bones the <i>vajra</i> was fashioned, the <i>vajra</i> itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather from his wings, as though due to the stroke of <i>vajra,</i> but otherwise was not affected by the <i>vajra</i> 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather of excellent form all beings (<i>sarvabhūtāni</i>) said “may this bird be Suparṇa” (<i>surūpaṃ</i> <i>patram ālakṣya suparṇo 'yaṃ bhavatv iti</i>) 1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship, and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1 (Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1. 27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of taking it away; both hatched a plan— Indra was to take away <i>amṛta</i> once Garuḍa had placed it before the serpents and freed his mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose serpents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his epithets like <i>pannagāśana</i> 2. 22. 23; 5. 110. 5, 15; 5. 117. 23; <i>pannagasūdana</i> 1. 14. 22; <i>bhujagendrāri</i> 5. 110. 1; <i>bhujagāri</i> 10. 13. 4); Garuḍa brought <i>amṛta</i> to serpents and placed it for them on the <i>kuśa</i> grass; he asked them to take it after they had bathed and become auspicious (<i>maṅgalasaṃyuktāḥ</i>); he asked serpents to free his mother from slavery from that day; the serpents agreed and went to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the forest and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa, Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that Garuḍa would free Vinatā from slavery 1. 14. 18); <i>phalaśruti:</i> One who hears or recites this narrative (<i>kathā</i>) will go to heaven due to his glorifying Garuḍa, the lord of the birds (<i>patagapati</i>) 1. 30. 22. <b>E.</b> Gālava episode: Gālava was asked by his teacher Viśvāmitra to give him as <i>dakṣiṇā</i> eight hundred moon-like white horses, each having a black ear on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to procure these, Gālava desired to take recourse to Viṣṇu; just then Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja), the friend of Gālava, appeared before him and offered to take him to any place 5. 105. 14-19; Suparṇa described to Gālava the four directions 5. Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava the etymology of the name of the direction <i>uttarā</i> (<i>yasmād uttāryate pāpāt</i> ‘because one is freed there from sin’ 5. 109. 1; also <i>guṇair</i> <i>anyair dig uttarā</i> ‘a direction superior (to others) in different qualities’, and <i>sarva-</i> <i>karmasu cottarā</i> ‘better (than other directions) for performing all rites’ 5. 109. 24); Gālava requested Garuḍa (named variously as Garutmant, Suparṇa, Vinatātmaja, Tārkṣya, Aruṇānuja) to take him to the east; Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to stand the speed of Garuḍa, Gālava requested him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15; Gālava told Garuḍa that his real purpose was to obtain the eight hundred horses and since he knew no way to obtain them he thought of giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17; Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with Gālava for wanting to end his life and told him: “The time of death is not determined by any person, Kāla is rather supreme (<i>na</i> <i>cāpi kṛtrimaḥ kālaḥ kālo hi parameśvaraḥ</i> [Nīla.: <i>kṛtrimaḥ svecchāsampādyaḥ</i> 5. 112. 20 Bom. Ed.]) 5. 110. 19-20; he told Gālava that they would first repair to mountain Ṛṣabha in the heart of the ocean, eat, rest, and then return 5. 110. 22; on the peak of the Ṛṣabha mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāhmaṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was reduced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī and had planned to take her away from that place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī relented and told Garuḍa that he would be ‘Suparṇa’ again; Garuḍa got back his wings which were stronger than before (Nīla. <i>draviṇavattarau = balavattarau</i> 5. 113. 17 Bom. Ed.) 5. 111. 17; Śāṇḍilī advised Garuḍa not to despise women at any time even if they deserved to be despised (<i>na ca te garhaṇīyāpi</i> <i>garhaṇīyāḥ striyaḥ kvacit</i> 5. 111. 16) 5. 111. 1-17; when Viśvāmitra, on his way, saw Gālava without the horses he had asked for, he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya and said he would further wait for a period of the same duration as before; Suparṇa, having heard what Viśvāmitra had said, explained to Gālava the importance of gold and wealth (he told him the etymology of the word <i>dhana: dhatte dhārayate cedam etasmāt</i> <i>kāraṇād dhanam</i> 5. 112. 2) and took him to his friend, king Yayāti, for getting wealth to purchase the required horses; when they met Yayāti, Garuḍa (<i>vinatāsuta</i>) requested him on Gālava's behalf to part with some wealth; Garuḍa assured Yayāti that Gālava in return would give him a part of his <i>tapas;</i> Garuḍa told Yayāti that since he was qualified to give a gift and Gālava to receive it his giving gift to Gālava would be like pouring milk in a conch shell (<i>śaṅkhe kṣīram ivā-</i> <i>saktam</i> 5. 112. 20) 5. 111. 18-23; 5. 112. 1-20; Yayāti listened to what Suparṇa had said; he was delighted to meet Tārkṣya, his friend; but Yayāti told him that he was no longer wealthy; however as it was not meet to frustrate the hopes of a <i>viprarṣi,</i> he was prepared to part with his daughter Mādhavī by marrying whom to some king Gālava could acquire wealth as bride price (<i>śulka</i>) to buy the horses; Garuḍa having shown the way to Gālava to acquire the horses left him and went to his residence 5. 113. 1-16; when Gālava had procured six hundred out of the eight hundred required <i>śyāmakarṇa</i> horses, he met Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) again 5. 116. 21; Garuḍa (Vainateya) heard Gālava's story; he (Suparṇa) told Gālava that he would never find more than six hundred horses as, before him, Ṛcīka did not get more than six hundred horses; Garuḍa advised Gālava to give Mādhavī to Viśvāmitra in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses; Suparṇa then took Gālava, Mādhavī and the six hundred horses to Viśvāmitra; Gālava was thus able to pay the <i>dakṣiṇā</i> his teacher had demanded with the help of Suparṇa; Gālava permitted Suparṇa to leave 5. 117. 1-23. <b>F.</b> Sumukha (a serpent) episode: Serpent Āryaka told Mātali who wanted his daughter to be married to Sumukha that Cikura, his son, was killed by Vainateya and that the same fate awaited his grand-son Sumukha in a month's time; Mātali assured Āryaka that he would endeavour to mitigate the threat of Suparṇa to Sumukha; when they all approached Indra, Viṣṇu asked Indra to give <i>amṛta</i> to Sumukha and make him immortal; Indra, remembering the prowess of Vainateya, was reluctant to part with <i>amṛta</i> and asked Viṣṇu himself to give it to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again, Indra gave only long life to Cikura but not <i>amṛta</i> 5. 102. 14-27; 5. 101. 24. <b>G.</b> Association with Viṣṇu: (1) As standing on his flag-staff and as his vehicle: While fetching <i>amṛta</i> from heaven, Vainateya met Viṣṇu on way; when offered a boon by Viṣṇu, Garuḍa chose that he should stay above Viṣṇu (<i>tava tiṣṭheyam upari</i>); when Garuḍa in return offered a boon to Viṣṇu, he chose Garuḍa to serve him as his vehicle (<i>vāhana</i>), and since Garuḍa wanted to stand above him Viṣṇu asked Garuḍa to stand on his flag-staff (<i>dhvajaṃ ca cakre</i>) 1. 29. 12-16; hence after the death of Jarāsandha when Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa (Garutmant), he instantly appeared and took his seat on (the flag-staff of) the chariot; the flag-staff then appeared as a raised <i>caitya</i> post 2. 22. 2223; Kṛṣṇa's flag marked with Garuḍa when he started for Hāstinapura 5. 81. 20; when Dāruka brought Kṛṣṇa's chariot for the use of Sātyaki it was marked with Suparṇa 7. 122. 43; also 7. 56. 33 (Vainateya); when Kṛṣṇa got his chariot ready to pursue Aśvatthāman, Vainateya stood on the flag-staff 10. 13. 4; when, at the end, the Vṛṣṇis were helplessly looking on, Suparṇa on the flag of Kṛṣṇa was taken away day and night by the Apsaras 16. 4. 5; Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) is called <i>Garuḍadhvaja</i> 7. 57. 2; 13. 11. 5; 13. 135. 51; <i>Suparṇa-</i> <i>ketu</i> 3. 173. 15; <i>Tārkṣyaketana</i> 2. 2. 12; 12. 48. 14; <i>Tārkṣyapravaraketana</i> 2. 42. 55; <i>Tārkṣyadhvaja</i> 8. 27. 65; (also cf. 12. 46. 34); <i>Tārkṣyalakṣaṇa</i> 12. 43. 8; Kṛṣṇa used Vainateya as his vehicle while fetching Pārijāta from Amarāvatī 7. 10. 22; he used Tārkṣya as vehicle while going to Himavant to propitiate Śiva 13. 14. 26 and Vainateya while waiting on him 13. 14. 142; Garuḍa felt he was disregarded by Indra because he stood on the flag of Indra's younger brother and because he carried him (Kṛṣṇa) on his back and was thus reduced to the state of a servant 5. 103. 13, 8; Viṣṇu asked Garutmant to bring king Vasu Uparicara from Pātāla and make him a <i>khecara</i> 12. 324. 30-35; (2) Removal of Garuḍa's pride: When Garuḍa knew that Indra had granted long life to the serpent Sumukha he blamed Indra for depriving him of his food; he threatened to give up his life and said that as long as Indra was there he had nothing to do with Viṣṇu (<i>na viṣṇuḥ kāraṇaṃ mama</i>) 5. 103. 1-17; Viṣṇu scolded Garuḍa (Tārkṣya, Garutmant) for praising himself although in reality he was very weak; Viṣṇu told Garuḍa that he did not really carry Viṣṇu but Viṣṇu carried himself and also Garuḍa (<i>aham evātmanātmānaṃ</i> <i>vahāmi tvāṃ ca dhāraye</i> 5. 103. 20); however he asked Garuḍa to carry only his right arm, and when the arm was placed on Garuḍa he fell down under its weight and became almost unconscious (<i>vicetāḥ</i>); he shed many feathers; Viṣṇu did not deprive him of his life; finally Garuḍa bowed down to Viṣṇu and begged for forgiveness 5. 103. 18-30. <b>H.</b> Association with Śeṣa: Śeṣa complained to Pitāmaha that his dull-witted brothers (serpents) hated their brother (cousin) Vainateya and he in turn hated them 1. 32. 10-11; Pitāmaha then made Garuḍa (Suparṇa, Vainateya) a friend of Śeṣa 1. 32. 25. <b>I.</b> Association with Skanda: Suparṇa gave Skanda a feather and a peacock as toy (<i>krīḍanīya</i>) 13. 86. 20-21; he gave peacock to Skanda 9. 45. 46; he attended Skanda's consecration as general of the army 9. 44. 14; some of the warriors of Skanda were Garuḍa-faced (<i>garuḍānanāḥ</i>) 9. 44. 79. <b>J.</b> Garuḍa's other feats: (1) Suparṇa swallowed a quail which, however, was freed by Aśvinau 1. 3. 62; (2) Garutmant often went to the mountain Himavant 12. 314. 6; Suparṇa once carried away forcibly the big snake Ṛddhimant living near a lake on the Gandhamādana mountain; the wonderful feat (<i>adbhutam</i>) was witnessed by the Pāṇḍavas 3. 157. 14-15; (3) A serpent (not named), husband of the daughter of Airāvata, killed by Suparṇa 6. 86. 7; (4) Suparṇa (and Suparṇas) fought with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who protected the fire at Khāṇḍava; he fought with wings, beak, and nails 1. 218. 19-20; 8. 63. 68 (<i>nakha, daśana</i> (? for beak); (5) During his fight with demons (Daiteyas) he performed the great feat of killing six of them 5. 103. 11-12. <b>K.</b> Strength: Indra described Garuḍa as a great being (<i>mahad bhūtam</i>) and wished to know the extent of his strength (1. 29. 22, 23); Garuḍa said that although good persons did not themselves describe their strength and virtues he would do so due to his friendship with Indra; Garuḍa could carry the whole earth with mountains etc., the worlds, even with Śakra, with only a quill of his feather (<i>pakṣanāḍī</i>), and this without feeling fatigue 1. 30. 2-5; also cf. 1. 20. 10-14; 1. 26. 6-9; 5. 103. 10-11, 17. <b>L.</b> Greatness: (1) Called <i>mahātman</i> 1. 28. 24; (2) Destined to be the only Indra of all birds and was so consecrated 1. 27. 29, 35; hence he is called <i>khageśvara</i> 1. 20. 14;
