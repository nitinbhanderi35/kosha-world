There is a story regarding them in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, as follows:— <dvsn n='NI'/>Skandadeva approached his father Śiva. At that time Śiva, Pārvatī, Agni and Gaṅgā, all wished in their minds that Skanda should come to him or her. Understanding the desire of each, by Yogabala (the power obtained by union with the Universal Soul) Skanda divided himself into four persons, Skanda, Viśākha, Śākha and Naigameya and went to each of them respectively and fulfilled their desire. (For further details see under Subrahmaṇya)."
