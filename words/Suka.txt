            "content": "ŚUKA I¦. (ŚUKADEVA). The son of Vyāsa. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Birth.</i> The sage Vyāsa once wished to have a son. So he began to worship Śiva for the purpose. His desire was to have a son who would combine in him the essential qualities of fire, earth, water, air and ether He did tapas for a hundred years. Because of the austerity of his tapas, his locks of hair began to blaze like flames of fire. At last Śiva appeared and blessed him to have a son according to his wish. <dvsn n='NI'/>After receiving his boon, Vyāsa returned to his āśrama. Soon after his arrival there, an Apsaras named Ghṛtācī came there in the form of a parrot. On seeing her beauty Vyāsa had an involuntary emission of semen. Śuka's birth was from this semen. (For further details see Para 2, under Ghṛtācī). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Śuka's Boyhood.</i> It was Śiva who performed the Upanayana (wearing the sacred thread) ceremony of Śuka. Since he was born out of the semen which was the result of the fascination for a parrot, the boy was named “Śuka”. He was a divine boy. Soon after his birth, he grew up into an exceptionally brilliant boy. He went to Bṛhaspati and mastered all knowledge. After staying with Bṛhaspati for some years, he returned to his father's āśrama. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>In Vyāsa's hut.</i> Vyāsa was very happy at the arrival of his son after completing his education. In due course he thought of getting his son married to a suitable girl and to prepare him for an ideal Grhasthāśrama. But Śuka did not fall in with his father's proposal. All the efforts of Vyāsa to persuade him were in vain. At last he told Śuka that he was pleased with his stern resolve and allowed him to pursue his life as a Sannyāsī, if he wished for it. <dvsn n='NI'/>From that time Śukadeva and Sūta, the disciple of Vyāsa began the study of Bhāgavata. But Śuka did not find happiness in that study either. Vyāsa taught him spiritual philosophy. Even then Śuka could not find mental satisfaction. So his father sent him to Mithilā. At that time there was none who equalled Janaka, the then King of Mithilā. Before sending him away, Vyāsa made his son promise that he would return to his āśrama, immediately after leaving Mithilā. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Śuka in Mithilā.</i> Śuka started his journey to Mithilā on foot. He passed through many lands and cities on his way. He visited many places inhabited by different classes of people like yogins, sages, mendicants, Vaikhānasas, Śāktas, Pāśupatas, Sauras, Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, etc. After taking two years to cross Mahāmeru and one year for crossing Himālaya he reached Mithilā. At the very sight of the land of Mithilā with its inhabitants living in luxury and prosperity, Śukadeva was filled with wonder. <dvsn n='NI'/>One of the sentries at the palace gate who saw the dignified bearing and majestic figure of Śuka, standing at the entrance, greeted him with joined palms and conducted him into the royal palace. From there, a minister took him to the interior of the palace, where a passage led him to a beautiful park full of flowering trees and swimming pools. After giving him a seat in the park the minister left the place. There, he was attended by women who were like celestial beauties. But Śuka was not happy even in their company or attentions. He spent the whole night in deep meditation. The next morning King Janaka visited Śuka. After the exchange of customary greetings, Janaka enquired of him the object of his visit. Śuka answered that he came there to learn from Janaka the way to salvation, as directed by his father. <dvsn n='NI'/>On hearing this, Janaka said:—“After Upanayana, (investiture with the sacred thread) a Brāhmaṇa should study the Vedas. He should discharge his debts to the Devas and to his Pitṛs by tapas, worship of the guru and Brahmacarya. After the study of the Vedas, after mastering the senses, he should give Gurudakṣiṇā (fee to the teacher). Then the pupil may return home with the permission of the Guru (preceptor). After reaching home he should begin gṛhasthāśrama. After the birth of children, he should follow Vānaprasthāśrama. In that āśrama, a Brāhmaṇa should kindle fire in his soul. He should then renounce the dual state, rise above all desire and remain in Brahmāśrama.” <dvsn n='NI'/>After receiving Janaka's advice, Śuka returned to his father. <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Domestic Life.</i> Śukadeva married the beautiful Pīvarī, daughter of the Pitṛs and thus began his gṛhasthāśrama in Vyāsa's āśrama. He had four sons named Kṛṣṇa, Gauraprabha, Bhūri and Devaśruta and a daughter named Kīrti, by Pīvarī. Kīrti was married by Aṇu, the son of King Vibhrāja. (Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha). <dvsn n='NI'/>6) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Vyāsa composed Bhārata and taught it to Śuka. (M.B. Chapter 1, Verse 104). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Śukadeva recited the Mahābhārata story containing 14 lakhs of stanzas to Gandharvas, Yakṣas and Rākṣasas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 106; Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 55). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Śukadeva taught them the entire Vedas and the Mahābhārata story. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 63, Verse 89). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Śuka attended Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11). <dvsn n='NI'/>7) <i>The End.</i> While Śukadeva was thus leading his family life, teaching the Vedas and reading the Purāṇas, Nārada happened to pay a visit to him. His conversation with Nārada drew Śukadeva nearer to the path of Mokṣa. He left his father, Veda Vyāsa and his own family, went to the peak of Kailāsa and stayed there doing tapas to Paramaśiva. At last he became a perfect Siddha and rising up to the Heavens shone there as a second sun. Devarṣis began to praise Śukadeva. <dvsn n='NI'/>His father Vyāsa was in deep grief at his disappearance and left his āśrama in search of Śuka. After wandering in many places he came to Kailāsa where Śuka had performed tapas and called him. Śiva who saw him utterly tired and weak took pity on him and comforted him in the following words: “Did you not pray to me for a son who would combine in himself the essences of the Pañcabhūtas? As a result of the tapas you have done and by my blessing, such a glorious son was born to you. Śuka has attained the highest position which is inaccessible to those who have not conquered their senses and difficult to attain even by the gods. Why do you worry about Śuka? The glory acquired by your eminent son will continue undiminished as long as the mountains and oceans exist. I give you my blessing that an image exactly like your son will always accompany you from today.” Just then, an image which closely resembled his son appeared before Vyāsa who was filled with rapture. <dvsn n='NI'/>It is believed that even today if any one calls Śiva at the place where Śiva spoke to Vyāsa in answer to his call, Śiva would respond to the call. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapters 332 and 333; Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha)."

These two persons were expert spies who used to gather secret and important pieces of information from the strongholds of Rāvaṇa's friends and enemies and passed them on to Rāvaṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>Soon after Śrī Rāma entered Laṅkā, Rāvaṇa sent Śuka and Sāraṇa to Śrī Rāma's camp. After taking a distant view of the surroundings, they entered the camp of Śrī Rāma in the form of monkeys. Taking care not to come within the observation of Vibhīṣaṇa, they went about the military camps, gathering secret information. Just then they were met by Jāmbavān and Hanūmān. After closely observing them for a considerable time, they understood that they were enemy spies. The monkey-heroes promptly seized them and produced them before Sugrīva. Confused and frightened under a shower of questions they sought the protection of Śrī Rāma. While Śrī Rāma was interrogating them, Vibhīṣaṇa happened to come there. At his sight, Śuka and Sāraṇa were alarmed. Grasping the whole situation in an instant, Vibhīṣaṇa kicked both of them when they assumed their former shapes as Rākṣasas. The monkey-leaders sprang at them. The Rākṣasas begged for pardon and prayed for Śrī Rāma's protection. Śrī Rāma forgave them and set them free. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa; Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa)."
