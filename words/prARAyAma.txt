Spread on the floor a piece of cloth, or animal-skin or Kuśa grass and sitting on it cross-legged, controlling all actions of the sense-organs and concentrating on one single object do prāṇāyāma for the purification of the soul. There are three different kinds of prāṇāyāmas namely Recakaprāṇāyāma, Pūrakaprāṇāyāma and Kumbhakaprāṇāyāma. <dvsn n='NI'/>Holding the nostrils with the left hand and massaging the belly with the other hand one sends out the air within the belly. It is called Recakaprāṇāyāma. Doing just the reverse and getting air inside is called Pūrakaprāṇāyāma. Then the yogī sits, with his belly full of air. Sitting thus without either letting the air out or letting it in is called Kumbhakaprāṇāyāma. Here the yogī sits like a pūrṇa-kumbha (full jar). The body of man is a chariot, the sense organs its horses, mind the charioteer and prāṇāyāma the whip. (Chapter 373, Agni Purāṇa)."
