            "content": "<i>Amṛtotpādanam</i>¦ (see <i>Amṛtam</i>) — suggested by HariAjita to secure immortality for gods. It was to churn the <i>kṣīroda</i> with Mandara as stick and Vāsuki as rope. The Asuras agreed to aid the gods in securing <i>Amṛta.</i> Hari took hold at first of the head, and when the Asuras protested, of the tail of Vāsuki. Seeing exhaustion on the part of gods owing to obstacle of Vighneśa, Hari propped up the Mandara hill, assuming the form of a tortoise. With continuous effort, the churning went on. First appeared <i>Hālāhala</i> which was consumed by Śiva on an appeal from the Prajāpatis and with the permission of Pārvatī. Then came out <i>Kāmadhenu</i> which sages appropriated for agnihotra; <i>Uccaiśśravas,</i> a horse which Bali took; then <i>Airāvata: Kaustubha</i> gem appropriated by Hari, then <i>Pārijāta, Apsaras</i> women and then <i>Srī</i> married to Hari. Then came out <i>Vāruṇīdevī</i> whom Asuras seized, then Dhanvantari with a pot of <i>Amṛta.</i> There was then a rush on both sides to get the <i>Amṛta</i> first when Hari assumed the form of <i>Mohinī</i> and arrested their attention. Moved by her beauty, both gods and Asuras agreed to let her distribute the <i>Amṛta</i> to all of them. She began with the gods and was serving them first. Noticing this <i>Rāhu</i> took the guise of a god. On being pointed out by the sun and moon, Hari cut off his head with his <i>Cakra.</i> The Asuras found that they had been deluded by Hari and set their face against Him. See <i>Amṛtam.</i> <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. VIII. 6. 21-25, 31-32. Ib. ch. 7-9 (whole); Ib. 10. 1."
