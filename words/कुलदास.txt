So the whole will literally mean ‘a servant of the community or family’. Dharmaśāstras prescribe <i>‘dāsa’</i> to be used by śūdras at the end of their names but we do not find any strict adherence to this rule by the society. <i>Dāsa-</i> ending names show devotion. We have such names as ‘Kulabhūṣaṇa’ based on the word <i>‘kula’.</i>"
