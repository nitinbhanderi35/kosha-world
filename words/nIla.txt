To dispel their pride Kṛṣṇa disappeared abruptly from their midst and sported with the woman called Nīlā. Then she also became proud that Kṛṣṇa loved her more than the others, and she asked him to carry her on his shoulders. He stood there ready stretching his neck to carry her. But, when she stood with her legs parted to mount on Kṛṣṇa's neck and looked for him he was missing; he had already disappeared. The Gopikās ultimately shed their pride and then Kṛṣṇa appeared before them. (Ceruśśeri's Malayālam Epic Kṛṣṇa Gāthā)."
