Āṭavī as a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.<sup>80</sup> The Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.<sup>81</sup> We find a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,<sup>82</sup> which needs must influence their future advance to civilization. Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic List of Peoples.<sup>83</sup> Similar terms <i>‘vana-rāṣṭra’</i> ‘forest-countries’ and <i>vana-rājya</i> ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the BṛhatSaṃhitā.<sup>84</sup> But these countries lay in the north-east division of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at any rate, not the countries referred here.<sup>85</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of Sahadeva's <i>digvijaya,</i> Professor Franklin Edgerton changes <i>Āṭavī</i> to <i>Antākhi,</i> so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately associated in history and consequently they are still associated in the minds of Western scholars, and hence <i>Antākhi</i> made more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the Greeks than <i>Āṭavī.</i> But it only represents his personal opinion.<sup>86</sup>"
