(As the history of Nala is included under the word Damayantī, some points which are not given there, are mentioned here). <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Nala was the son of Vīrasena, the King of Niṣadha. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 56). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Once the hermit Bṛhadaśva came to the Palace of Vīrasena and praised Nala a good deal and spoke highly of his good qualities to his father. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 2). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) When Nala was playing in the garden some swans with golden wings flew to the lake in the garden. Nala caught hold of one of them just for fun. The swan said to Nala, “If you will let me off, I will tell Damayantī about you.” So it was released. As a reward it flew to the country of Vidarbha and persuaded Damayantī to love Nala. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) After death Nala sat in the aerial chariot of Indra and witnessed the battle fought by Arjuna with the Kauravas at the end of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 56, Stanza 10). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Previous birth. Two different stories are narrated about the previous birth of Nala. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) In the previous birth Nala was a Vaiśya of the city of Pippala in the Gauḍa country. This Vaiśya became abstinent and after leaving off everything he had, he went to the forest. There, according to the advice of a hermit he undertook the fast of Gaṇeśa. As a result he was born as Nala in the next birth. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) Nala and Damayantī were foresters named Āhuka and Āhukā. Śiva was pleased with the couple. So they were born in royal families in the next birth, and Śiva in the form of a swan, helped them. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudra Saṃhitā)."

A bridge had to be made to cross the sea and reach Laṅkā. Immediately Varuṇa the King of the seas appeared there and said, “Nala who is in the monkeyarmy, is the son of Viśvakarmā. His father had given him a blessing that he would become as expert an architect as his father. So let the construction of the bridge be commenced under his supervision.” Accordingly under the supervision of Nala, Rāma's bridge of rock was completed and Śrī Rāma and the army of monkeys reached Laṅkā by walking over this bridge (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 22). <dvsn n='NI'/>In the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, Nala fought with the giant Tuṇḍaka.
