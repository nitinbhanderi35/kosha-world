But there is probably no justification for taking <i>nidhi-nikṣepa</i> as a single unit. <dvsn n='P'><i>Cf. aṣṭabhoga-tejassvāmya-daṇḍaśulka-yukta</i> (<i>Ind. Ant.,</i> Vol. XIX, p. 247, text line 102), mentioned along with <i>nidhi-</i> <i>nikṣepa-pāṣāṇ-ārām-ādi-catuṣ-prakāra-bīravaṇa-pārikh-āya-sahita.</i> The separate mention of these two groups shows that <i>aṣṭa-bhoga</i> vaguely indicated all kinds of proprietary rights."
