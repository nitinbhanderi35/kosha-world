When the education of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas was over, Droṇa asked his pupils to bring Drupada tied as teacher's gift. An attempt was made to bring Drupada before Droṇa, in which attempt Drupada and Arjuna confronted each other. In this fight it was Satyajit who stood as the right hand of his brother Drupada. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 137, Verse 42). Arjuna defeated this Satyajit. Immediately Satyajit ran away from the battle-field. <dvsn n='NI'/>After the marriage of Pāñcālī, Pāṇḍavas and Drupada became relatives. With this Satyajit also came to be on good relation with the Pāṇḍavas. In the battle of Bhārata this Satyajit was the bodyguard of Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 17). In the battle which followed Droṇa killed Satyajit. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 4)."
