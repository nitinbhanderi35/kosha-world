She sat upon his right thigh and wished him to be her husband. He replied that the left lap was for the wife, but the right for the daughters and daughters-in-law; therefore he accepted her for his son, to which <i>Gaṅgā</i> consented on the condition that his son should not be able to judge of the propriety of her acts. Then <i>Pratīpa</i>, along with his wife, engaged in ascetic austerities from desire of offspring, and when they had grown old, <i>Mahābhiṣa</i> (v. Mahābhiṣop.) was born as a son to them and was called <i>Śāntanu</i>, because his father had controlled his passion (<i>śāntasya santānaḥ</i>, v. 3882, cf. 3799). When <i>Śāntanu</i> had grown to become a youth, <i>Pratīpa</i> told him about his appointment with the celestial damsel, installed him upon the throne, and retired into the woods. <i>Śāntanu</i>, who was addicted to hunting, one day came upon the banks of <i>Gaṅgā</i>, frequented by <i>Siddhas</i> and <i>Cāraṇas</i>, and there he requested <i>Gaṅgā</i>, in the form of a lovely maiden, to become his wife (I, <b>97</b>). (For continuation v. Bhīṣmotpatti.)"
