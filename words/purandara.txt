In Matsya Purāṇa Purandara has been considered to be one among the eighteen Vāstuśāstrakāras (adepts in house building). The other seventeen are: Bhṛgu, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Viśvakarmā, Maya, Nārada, Nagnajit, Viśālākṣa, Brahmā, Kumāra, Nandīśa, Śaunaka, Garga, Vāśudeva, Śukra, Bṛhaspati and Aniruddha. (Matsya Purāṇa, Chapter 252, verses 2 and 3). <dvsn n='NI'/>According to Mahābhārata Lord Śiva wrote a book “Vaiśālākṣa” containing ten thousand chapters dealing with Dharmārthakāmas. Purandara condensed it into a book of five thousand chapters called ‘Bāhudantaka.’ Purandara gave that book that name in honour of his mother who was called Bāhudantī. (Chapters 59, 89 and 90, Śānti Parva)."
