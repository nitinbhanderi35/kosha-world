Bhīṣmotp.): <i>Gaṅgā</i> fully related to <i>Śāntanu</i> the reason why the <i>Brahmarṣi Vasiṣṭha</i> (or <i>Āpava</i>), the son of <i>Varuṇa</i>, had cursed the <i>Vasus</i>. When the <i>Vasus, Pṛthu</i> (or <i>Dhara</i>), etc., were wandering with their wives in the wood near <i>Vasiṣṭha's</i> hermitage, frequented by the <i>devarṣis, Dyaus</i> was prevailed upon by his wife (assisted by his brothers), in the interest of her friend <i>Jitavatī</i>, daughter of <i>Uśīnara</i>, to steal <i>Vasiṣṭha's homadhenu [Nandinī]</i> (daughter of <i>Kaśyapa</i> and <i>Surabhi</i>, the daughter of <i>Dakṣa</i>), by drinking whose milk one could remain in unchanged youth for 1,000 years. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, however, was prevailed upon to let among them <i>Dyaus</i> alone (who was to be conversant with all <i>śāstras</i>, etc.) dwell on earth for a long time without marrying. Then <i>Gaṅgā</i>, taking with her the child (<i>Gāṅgeya</i> or <i>Devavrata</i>, i.e. <i>Bhīṣma</i>), went away, and <i>Śāntanu</i> returned to his capital—“I shall now recount the virtues of the <i>Bhārata Śāntanu</i>, whose splendid story is called the <i>Mahābhārata</i>” (I, <b>99</b>). (For continuation v. Satyavatīlabhop.)"
