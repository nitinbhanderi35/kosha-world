Once under the curse of Bhṛgu Maharṣi, Agni hid himself under the sea. (See “AGNI”). At that time, it was Atharvā who, at the suggestion of the Devas, went under the water and discovered Agni. (M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 8). <dvsn n='NI'/>Atharvā recovered Agni, and re-created the worlds which were lying dormant owing to the absence of fire. (M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 19). <dvsn n='NI'/>Atharvā was born from Brahmā's face. His wife was Śānti, the daughter of Kardama. Citti was another name for Śānti. But there are some Purāṇas which refer to Citti as another wife of Atharvā. Also, there are Purāṇas which say that Atharvā was Aṅgiras himself."

After learning Brahmavidyā from Brahmā, it was this Atharvā who first brought fire to the earth from heaven. Atharvā had two wives named Śānti and Citti. This Atharvā was the same person as Atharvaṇa, the son of Vasiṣṭha. (Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha, Chapter 1)."
