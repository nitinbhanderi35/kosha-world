The two hosts arrayed at sunrise (description). <i>Śakuni</i>, etc. (α), stood each at the head of an <i>akṣauhiṇī</i>; the 11th under <i>Bhīṣma</i> (description) stood in advance of the whole army. The <i>Sṛñjayas</i>, headed by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, looked [beholding <i>Bhīṣma</i>] like small animals beholding a lion (VI, <b>16</b>). On that day <i>Soma</i> approached the region of the <i>Pitṛs</i>. Omens. Every morning <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i> prayed for victory for the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, though they must fight for <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> according to their pledge: <i>Bhīṣma</i> briefly addressed the <i>Kuru</i> army, mentioning <i>Nābhaga</i>, etc. (β), as examples. <i>Karṇa</i>, with his friends and relatives, laid aside his weapons owing to <i>Bhīṣma</i>.

The leaders were <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (ε). Omens (VI, <b>19</b>). When the sun rose the <i>Kauravas</i> stood facing the west, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> facing the east. Disposition of the two armies: <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (ζ) (VI, <b>20</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sorrowfully addressed <i>Arjuna</i>, who consoled him with his truth, righteousness, etc., which <i>Nārada</i>, <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Droṇa</i> knew, and which were a powerful aid towards victory according to <i>Bráhman's</i> words to <i>Indra</i>, etc., on the occasion of the battle between the gods and the <i>Asuras</i>; “victory clings to Kṛṣṇa”; it was by choosing him that the gods under <i>Indra</i> had vanquished the <i>Asuras</i> (VI, <b>21</b>).

Beholding his relatives, etc., <i>Arjuna</i> was filled with compassion and overcome with despondency, and refused to fight (VI, <b>25</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> appealed to <i>Arjuna</i> to shake off his despondency, but in vain. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> then declared to <i>Arjuna</i> the nature and the attributes of the soul, and the folly of grieving for the dead, and exhorted him to comply with the duties of his order by fighting fairly, and to apply himself to work for work's sake, and not for the sake of its results. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> spoke of contemplation (VI, <b>26</b>); on the <i>Sāṅkhyas</i> and <i>Yogins</i>; on devotion to work (VI, <b>27</b>); on his reiterated births; on the best way (VI, <b>28</b>); on abandonment of actions and application to actions; he has the right view who considers <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and <i>Yoga</i> as one (VI, <b>29</b>); on the means of rising to devotion (VI, <b>30</b>); on <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> identified with <i>Bráhman</i> (VI, <b>31</b>); on the nature of Bráhman (VI, <b>32</b>); on <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> as the pervader of the whole universe, and as the enjoyer of all sacrifice (VI, <b>33</b>); on <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> as the source of the gods, etc. <i>Arjuna</i> believed what <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said, and what also had been said by all the Ṛ., and the D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>, and <i>Asita</i> <i>Devala</i> and <i>Vyāsa.
