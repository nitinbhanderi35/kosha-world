Parvasaṅgraha. § 8: Sauti related: Rāma (Jāmadagnya), having in the intervals between the Tretā and Dvāpara yugas repeatedly destroyed the warrior caste, formed five lakes of blood at Samantapañcaka, where he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, until those pacified him, and his lakes became holy <i>tīrthas</i> (places of pilgrimage).—§ 9: Sauti explained the term <i>akṣauhiṇī</i> (an army) and its subdivisions. Eighteen <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> partook of the battle; <i>Bhīṣma</i> holding the command for ten days, <i>Droṇa</i> for five, <i>Karṇa</i> for two, <i>Śalya</i> for half a day, the combat between <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> lasting half a day, and the nightly assault of <i>Drauṇi</i> (i.e. <i>Aśvatthāman</i>), <i>Hārdikya</i> (i.e. <i>Kṛtavarman</i>), and <i>Gautama</i> (i.e. <i>Kṛpa</i>) on <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> army taking place at the end of the same day.—§ 10: <i>Sauti</i> enumerated the 100 smaller parvans, or greater chapters, together with the three parvans of <i>Harivaṃśa</i> (together 103). —§ 11: <i>Sauti</i> enumerated the eighteen books or greater parvans, with <i>Harivaṃśa</i> as the nineteenth, with a summary of their contents, a computation of the number of verses, and renewed praises (I, <b>2</b>)."
