The later story is that the king was induced to abandon his family priests by two Asuras, Kirāta and Ākuli, who by their magic compassed the death of Subandhu, one of the brother priests, and that the others revived him by the use of the hymns (Rigveda, x. 57-60). <F>1) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167 (<i>Journal of the American Oriental Society,</i> 18, 41 <i>et seq.</i>); Sāṭyāyanaka, cited in Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 57, 1; 60, 7; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 83 <i>et seq.,</i> with Macdonell's notes; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 12, 5.</F> <F>2) x. 60, 2. 5; Av. vi. 79, 1. <i>Cf.</i> Bloomfield, <i>Hymns of the Atharvaveda,</i> 499; Max Müller, <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic</i> <i>Society,</i> 1866, 426-465; Böhtlingk's Dictionary, <i>s.v.;</i> Hopkins, <i>Transactions</i> <i>of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and</i> <i>Sciences,</i> 15, 48, n. 1.</F>"
