The <i>puṭṭi</i> and its fractions also denote the area of the land that is supposed by some to produce the particular quantities of grain. According to some, it is a land measure equal to 8 acres being presumably the area which can be sown with a <i>puṭṭi</i> of grain. There were different kinds of <i>puṭṭis,</i> e. g. <i>gāl-</i> <i>puṭṭi.</i> Cf. also <i>pelle-puṭṭi</i> regarded as equal to 80 <i>kuñcas</i> and <i>Malaca-puṭṭi</i> or Malacca ton as equal to 300 to 240 <i>kuñcas.</i> <dvsn n='P'>(<i>EI</i> 4, 27), a land and grain measure. <dvsn n='P'>(<i>IE</i> 8-5), same as Telugu <i>puṭṭi-dosillu,</i> ‘a fee of two handfuls from each <i>puṭṭi</i> of grain paid to the village-servants’."
