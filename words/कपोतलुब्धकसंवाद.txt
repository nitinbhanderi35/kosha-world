In one of the branches of that tree the male pigeon lamented the loss of his wife (XII, <b>144</b>). The she-pigeon answered him from within the hunter's cage, telling him to do the duties of hospitality to the fowler (XII, <b>145</b>). The male pigeon welcomed the fowler, who was stiff with cold, by igniting a fire; as the fowler was hungry, the pigeon (quoting Ṛ., D., and P.) himself entered the fire, at which the fowler became terrified, thinking of his own cruel life (XII, <b>146</b>), expressed his repentance, and set at liberty the she-pigeon, etc. (XII, <b>147</b>). The she-pigeon lamented for the death of her spouse; then she threw herself into the blazing fire; the couple of pigeons ascended to heaven (XII, <b>148</b>). The fowler took to rigid penances, perished in a forest conflagration, and beheld himself in heaven in splendour like <i>Indra</i> among Y. and G. and Si. (XII, <b>149</b>)."
