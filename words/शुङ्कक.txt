The present form may be due to the mistake of the engraver. The word Śuṅkaka is meaningless. Śaṅku is the name of Lord Śiva. We have many names based on the word Śaṅku in literature. Śaṅkuka was the name of a poet (author of the Bhuvanābhyudaya and son of Mayūra),<sup>66</sup> and also of a writer on rhetoric.<sup>67</sup>"
