A small quantity of <i>Rudra's</i> seed, however, leaped into <i>fire</i> and began to develop; mean while, the gods, with <i>Indra</i>, were scorched by As. <i>Tāraka</i>; Ā., V., R., M., A., and Sā. all became afflicted; all the regions of the deities, etc., and the retreats of Ṛ. were snatched away by As.; D. and Ṛ. repaired to <i>Brahmán</i> (XIII, <b>84</b>), who had granted <i>Tāraka</i> the boon that he should not be killed by D., As., or Rā., and <i>Umā</i> had cursed D.; <i>Brahmán</i> said that <i>Agni</i> was not there; therefore his offspring, transcending D., Dā., Rā., even G., N., and birds, will with his dart destroy <i>Tāraka; Kāma</i> is eternal, and in order to slay the enemies of the gods <i>Agni</i> will throw <i>Rudra's</i> seed into the <i>Gaṅgā</i>. The gods failed to find out <i>Agni</i>; a frog, having been scorched by the energy of <i>Agni</i>, appeared on the surface of the water, and said to the gods that <i>Agni</i> was now under the water; <i>Agni</i>, leaving the spot, cursed the frogs, saying that they should be without taste; the gods granted them boons (enumeration). An elephant revealed to the gods that <i>Agni</i> was now residing within a certain <i>aśvattha</i> tree; <i>Agni</i>, entering the heart of the <i>śamī</i> tree, cursed all the elephants, saying that their tongues should be bent back; the gods granted that they should be able to eat everything and utter indistinct cries. <i>Agni</i> was then revealed by a parrot, and cursed the parrots, saying that they should be deprived of the power of speech; the gods granted them to speak the letter k, and made <i>śamī-</i>wood a sacred resting-place of fire. The waters in the nethermost regions had come into contact with <i>Agni</i>, and those heated waters are vomited forth by the mountain springs. The gods asked <i>Agni</i> to rescue D., <i>Prajāpatis</i>, and Ṛ. from <i>Tāraka</i> by begetting a heroic son. <i>Agni</i> united himself spiritually with <i>Gaṅgā</i>; an <i>Asura</i> uttered a frightful roar; <i>Gaṅgā</i> became agitated and unable to bear the seed, and threw it off on <i>Meru</i>; the fœtus had the complexion of gold, etc.; therefore Ṛ. and D. called <i>Agni</i> by the name of <i>Hiraṇyaretas</i> (“having gold for his vital seed”), and the earth <i>Vasumatī</i> (“endued with wealth”). That fœtus, having fallen in a thicket of reeds, assumed a wonderful form; the <i>Kṛttikāḥ</i> reared it as their son, whence it came to be called <i>Kārttikeya</i>; he was also called <i>Skanda</i> and <i>Guha</i> (etymology). It was in this way that gold came into existence as the offspring of <i>Agni (Jātavedas</i>), and hence gold was called <i>jātarūpa</i>; gold is truly the illustrious <i>Agni</i>, the lord of all things, and the foremost of all <i>Prajāpatis</i>; the most sacred of all sacred things is gold; it has for its essence <i>Agni</i> and <i>Soma</i>.— <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> continued: This tale (<i>Brahmadarśana</i>) was also heard by me in days of yore about <i>Brahmán Paramātman</i> (“the Supreme Soul”): In days of yore (<i>lokādau</i>, v. 4163), <i>Rudra</i>, who is <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (δ), having assumed the form of <i>Varuṇa</i> (cf. v. 4133, <i>Varuṇaḥ Pāvanātmakaḥ</i>), performed a sacrifice, to which came the <i>munis</i> and all the deities with <i>Agni</i>, etc. (ε).; <i>Śiva</i> (i.e. <i>Rudra</i>) then himself poured libations into his own self. At the sight of the celestial damsels the seed (endued with <i>sattva, rajas</i>, and <i>tamas</i>) of <i>Brahmán</i> fell upon the Earth; <i>Pūṣan</i> took it up, and it was taken with the sacrificial ladle and poured as an oblation into the fire; thence <i>Brahmán</i> caused the orders of beings to spring into existence; further <i>Bhṛgu</i>, etc. (ζ); for this reason <i>Agni</i> is said to be all the deities. <i>Bhṛgu</i> was reckoned the offspring of <i>Varuṇa, Aṅgiras</i> that of <i>Agni, Kavi</i> that of <i>Brahmán; Bhṛgu</i>, <i>Aṅgiras</i>, and <i>Kavi</i> were all of them <i>prajānāṃ patayaḥ</i>; their offspring (v. 4144—4152) (<i>Bhṛgu's</i>: η; <i>Aṅgiras'</i>: θ; <i>Kavi's</i>: ι) are called <i>Vāruṇāḥ</i>, and <i>Kavi</i> and <i>Bhṛgu Vāruṇau. Agni</i> is <i>Brahmán, Paśupati</i>, etc. (κ); gold is the offspring of <i>Agni</i> (v. 4146); when fire is not obtainable gold is used as a substitute, oh <i>Jāmadagnya!</i> (B. and C. wrongly read <i>Jāma-</i> <i>dagnyaḥ</i>, which PCR. translates “one that knows the identity of gold with fire”) by one who is conversant with the vedic authorities (v. 4165), etc. (v. 4166—7); <i>Agni</i> sprang from <i>Brahmán</i>, and from <i>Agni</i> sprang gold (v. 4168); those persons observant of righteousness who make gifts of gold are regarded as giving away all the deities (v. 4169), etc.; he who makes a gift of gold at the second twilight succeeds in attaining to residence with (<i>sālokyaṃ) Brahmán, Vāyu, Agni</i>, and <i>Soma</i> (v. 4173), and to the regions of <i>Indra</i> (v. 4174), etc.; he has never to fall down from the regions to which he attains (v. 4176). After a long time <i>Kārttikeya</i> grew up, and was chosen as generalissimo by all the gods with <i>Indra</i>; he slew Dai. <i>Tāraka</i> and many other <i>Asuras. Bhīṣma</i> continued: “Thus addressed by <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> [Rāma] <i>Jāma-</i> <i>dagnya</i> made gifts of gold to the brahmans and became cleansed of his sins” (XIII, <b>85</b>). [For continuation v. <i>Tārakavadhopākhyāna</i> (§ 748).]"
