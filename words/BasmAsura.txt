There is no mention about this demon in any of the Sanskrit purāṇas but ‘Śivalīlāmṛta’ in Marāṭhi contains the following story about him. <dvsn n='NI'/>Bhasmāsura was born of the Bhasma dust (ashes) on the body of Śiva. Pleased at the great devotion of the demon towards him Śiva asked him to name any boon he wanted. Bhasmāsura said that he wanted the power to burn to ashes anybody on whose head he placed his hand. Bhasmāsura became arrogant with the boon and he became a nightmare to the whole world. Then Mahāviṣṇu appeared before him in the form of Mohinī, an attractive dancer and alluring him by her charm started on a dance called Muktanṛtya. During the course of this dance Bhasmāsura was forced to place his hand on his own head and the moment his head touched his head he was burnt to ashes."
