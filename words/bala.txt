He created ninety-six different kinds of magic and gave them to the asura magicians who by the use of them gave the devas immense trouble. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once when Balāsura yawned three bad women, Svairiṇī, Kāminī and Puṃścalī were born. They had with them a potable substance called Hāṭaka which they gave to men whom they liked and after enlivening the sex impulse in them enjoyed a sexual life with them to their heart's content. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata). Once during a fight between Indra and Jalandhara Bala defeated Indra in a pathetic way. Indra then sought refuge in him and praised him with songs. Flattered by this Bala asked Indra to ask of him whatever he wanted and the sly Indra requested for the physical body of Bala. Without the least hesitation Bala cut his body into pieces and gave him. Indra threw away the cut pieces to different sides and all the places where these pieces fell were at once transformed into Diamond mines. <Poem>Taṃ tālumūlam pradahantamagnivad Gopālasūnum pitaraṃ jagadguroḥ Cacchardda sadyo 'tiruṣākṣatam BakaStuṇḍena hantum punarabhyapadyata Tamāpatantam sa nigṛhya tuṇḍayor Dorbhyām Bakaṃ Kaṃsasakhaṃ satām patiḥ Paśyatsu bāleṣu dadāra līlayā Mudāvaho vīraṇavaddivaukasām.</Poem> (Chapter II, Daśama Skandha, Bhāgavata). After the death of Balāsura his wife Prabhāvatī went to their preceptor (Kulaguru) Śukrācārya and told him all that took place and requested to bring back to life her lost husband. But Śukrācārya regretted that he could not give life again to her dead husband but could by his powers make her hear his voice again. Prabhāvatī agreed to that and then she heard her husband say “Leave your body and join me”. Prabhāvatī immediately courted death and joining Bala became a river. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 6)."
