Formerly, when the <i>Asuras</i> always defeated the gods, <i>Indra</i>, anxious to find out a leader for the celestial host, repaired to the <i>Mānasa</i> mountain, and, hearing a woman crying for protection, rescued her from the <i>Asura Keśin</i>, whom he wounded and put to flight (III, <b>223</b>). She told <i>Indra</i> that she was <i>Devasenā</i>, daughter of <i>Prajāpati</i>, and that her sister <i>Daityasenā</i> had let herself be taken away by <i>Keśin</i> from the <i>Mānasa</i> mountain, where they used to sport with their female friends with the permission of <i>Prajāpati. Indra</i> said that she was a sister's daughter of his mother <i>Dākṣāyaṇī</i>. She asked <i>Indra</i> to select a husband for her, who was able to conquer the gods, <i>Dānavas, Yakṣas, Kinnaras, Uragas, Rakṣas</i>, and <i>Daityas. Indra</i> was grieved, thinking there was no such husband for her.—§ 496. Then <i>Indra</i> perceived the Sun rising from the <i>Udaya</i> hill, and <i>Soma</i> (the Moon) entering the Sun on the <i>amāvasyā</i> (new-moon day) at the <i>Raudra muhūrta</i>, and the gods and <i>Asuras</i> fighting on the <i>Udaya</i> mountain, the morning twilight tinged with red clouds, the Sea bloodred; <i>Bhṛgus</i> and <i>Aṅgirases</i> offered oblations, and <i>Agni</i> took the oblations and entered the Sun, whilst the Sun was entering the twenty-fourth <i>parvan</i>, and <i>Sindhu</i> was flowing with a current of fresh blood, etc. <i>Indra</i> thought that, if now <i>Soma</i> or <i>Agni</i> gave birth to a son, this son might become the husband of <i>Devasenā</i>. Then he repaired with <i>Devasenā</i> to the world of <i>Brahmán</i>, who promised that it should be as <i>Indra</i> had thought. Then <i>Indra</i>. with <i>Devasenā</i>, repaired to the place where the <i>devarṣis Vasiṣṭha</i>, etc. lived, and the gods also came thither to drink <i>soma</i> and receive their shares of offerings, and the <i>Adbhuta</i> fire came from the solar disc to the <i>āhavanīya</i> and made over the offerings to the gods. He, (Adbhuta), then saw the wives of the <i>ṛṣis</i> sleeping in their <i>āśramas</i> and fell in love. In order to look at them daily, he entered the <i>gārhapatya</i> fire, and dwelt there for a long time, and at last, from despair, repaired to a forest in order to do away with himself. <i>Svāhā</i>, daughter of <i>Dakṣa</i>, who had in vain loved <i>Adbhuta</i>, now resolved upon assuming the guise of the wives of the seven <i>ṛṣis</i> (III, <b>224</b>). <i>Svāhā</i> first gratified her desire in the guise of <i>Śivā</i>, the wife of <i>Aṅgiras</i>, and then, lest somebody should unduly suspect the brāhmaṇa ladies, she went out of the forest in the guise of a bird (<i>garuḍī</i>, <i>suparṇī</i>), and on the <i>Śveta</i> mountain, that was covered with clumps of reeds and guarded with seven-headed poisonous serpents, <i>rākṣasas, Piśācas</i>, etc., she threw the semen, which she held in her hand, into a golden basin. Then, assuming successively the form of five of the others, she did the same on the first lunar day (<i>pratipadi</i>). Only the form of <i>Arundhatī</i> she was unable to assume because of her ascetic merit and devotion to her husband. The semen produced a child, whom the <i>ṛṣis</i> called <i>Skanda</i> (etymology v. 14315), with six heads, etc. On the second day it first assumed a form, on the 3rd it looked like a little child, on the fourth the limbs were developed. Seizing the bow used by the destroyer of <i>Tripura, Skanda</i> uttered a terrible roar, so that the great <i>nāgas Citra</i> and <i>Airāvata</i> sprang up. But <i>Skanda</i> seized them with two of his hands, and holding a dart in one hand, a cock in another, etc., and blowing a conch-shell, he terrified the creatures with his roars. The persons of various orders, who then sought the protection of <i>Skanda</i>, are called his followers by the brahmans (<i>pāriṣadān brāhmaṇān</i>, read <i>brāhmaṇāḥ</i>). Discharging his arrows in the direction of the <i>Śveta</i> mountain, he rent asunder the mountain <i>Krauñca</i>, the son of <i>Himavat</i>; therefore the swans and vultures go to the mountain <i>Meru</i>. The other mountains also screamed aloud. Then, with his lance, he rent in twain one of the peaks of the <i>Śveta</i> mountain. Mount <i>Śveta</i> and the other mountains left the Earth and fled: the Earth was torn asunder on all sides; she went to <i>Skanda</i> and regained her power; the mountains bowed down to <i>Skanda</i> and came back to the Earth, and all creatures worshipped <i>Skanda</i> on the fifth day of the lunar month (III, <b>225</b>).—§ 497. Terrific prodigies were seen everywhere. The <i>ṛṣis</i> tried to restore tranquillity to the universe. The inhabitants of the <i>Caitra-</i> <i>ratha</i> forest accused the wives of the six <i>ṛṣis</i>, other ones the fowl (<i>garuḍī</i>) of being the cause thereof; but nobody suspected <i>Svāhā</i>. The seven <i>ṛṣis</i> divorced their wives with the exception of <i>Arundhatī</i>, though <i>Svāhā</i> claimed the child as hers. <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, having concluded the sacrifice of the seven <i>ṛṣis</i>, had secretly followed the god of fire, and knew everything as it had happened. He sought the protection of <i>Skanda</i>, and performed for him the thirteen auspicious rites of childhood (<i>maṅgalāni kaumārāṇi</i>): the <i>jālakarman</i>, etc., etc. Though <i>Viśvāmitra</i> informed the seven <i>ṛṣis</i> of the innocence of their wives, yet they abandoned them unconditionally.— § 498. The gods asked <i>Indra</i> to kill <i>Skanda</i>, but he dared not attack him, saying that <i>Skanda</i> was able to destroy even the Creator of the world. Then they let the Mothers of the world approach in order to kill <i>Skanda</i>, but they adopted him as their son and let him suck their breasts, especially the daughter of <i>Krodha</i> with a spike in her hand, and the daughter of the Red Sea, who lived on blood; and his father <i>Agni</i> came and, transformed into <i>Naigameya</i> (see BR.) with a goat's month, gratified him with toys (III, <b>226</b>)."
