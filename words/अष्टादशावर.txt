(pl.): Designation of some unspecified eighteen junior families of warriors (?) <b>A.</b> Description: Described as Kṣatriyas arrogant while fighting (<i>kṣatriyair</i> <i>yuddhadurmadaiḥ</i>) 2. 13. 54. <b>B.</b> Epic events: (1) When the danger of Kaṃsa was over, but when Janāsandha was making preparations, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma held a council with the eighteen junior families of warriors (<i>bhaye tu samupakrānte jarā-</i> <i>sandhe samudyate / mantro 'yaṃ mantrito</i> <i>rājan kulair aṣṭādaśāvaraiḥ //</i>) 2. 13. 34; (2) The seat of the Yādavas at Kuśasthalī (2. 13. 49) was garrisoned by the eighteen junior Kṣatriya families of warriors (<i>sadma</i> <i> … aṣṭādaśāvaraīr naddhaṃ kṣatriyair yud-</i> <i>dhadurmadaiḥ</i>) 2. 13. 54; (3) The group of eighteen juniors were engaged in a battle with a certain king named Haṃsa, helped by some others; apparently Haṃsa was killed in this battle (<i>atha haṃsa iti khyātaḥ</i> <i>kaścid āsīn mahān nṛpaḥ / sa cānyaiḥ</i> <i>sahīto rājan saṃgrāme 'ṣṭādaśāvaraiḥ //</i>) 2. 13. 39; (4) Probably these junior families are meant when it is said that eighteen families, along with the northern Bhojas fled to the west due to fear of Jarāsandha (<i>udīcyabhojāś ca tathā kulāny</i> <i>aṣṭādaśābhibho / jarāsandhabhayād eva</i> <i>pratīcīṃ diśam āśritāḥ //</i>) 2. 13. 24."
