They were expounders of the Vedas. Though he was the son of Viśvāmitra his life was mostly connected with Vasiṣṭha. The Purāṇas do not make it clear how this son of Viśvāmitra happened to fall into the circle of Vasiṣṭha who was a foe of Viśvāmitra. He was one of the seven spiritual advisers of King Daśaratha. It is mentioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 48 that eight hermits such as Suyajña, Vāmadeva, Jābāli, Kaśyapa Vasiṣṭha and others lived in Ayodhyā in the palace of the King Daśaratha. <dvsn n='NI'/>When Bharata went to the forest, to bring Śrī Rāma back to Ayodhyā, Jābāli also followed him. Jābāli argued with Śrī Rāma, using several arguments, to make him return to Ayodhyā. These arguments made Śrī Rāma angry. But he was pacified by the consoling words of Vasiṣṭha. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Jābāli comes in the line of disciples of Vyāsa. Vyāsa divided the Veda and taught Sumantu Atharvaveda. The hermit Sumantu first taught Atharvaveda to his disciple Kabandha who divided it into two parts and taught two disciples Devadarśa, and Pathya. The disciples of Devadarśa were Magadha, Brahmabali, Sautkāyani and Pippalāda. Pathya had three disciples. They were Jābāli, Kumuda and Śaunaka. Of these Jābāli was a famous expounder of Atharvaveda. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3)."

Jābāli who performed penance on the mountain of Mandara had several disciples. <dvsn n='NI'/>While Jābāli was going along the forest he saw a young man of handsome appearance engaged in penance on the shore of a lake. Jābāli wanted to know about him and his penance. But as the young man was in deep meditation Jābāli had to wait there for several years. At last the young man awoke from his meditation and told Jābāli the secrets of devotional meditation and contemplation of Kṛṣṇa. The remaining life of Jābāli was spent in the worship of Kṛṣṇa, in consequence of which in the next birth he was reborn as a cowherdess, named Citragandhā in the house of the cowherd Pracaṇḍa. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapters 30, 72 and 109)."

Jābāli became a prey to the enticement of this heavenly beauty and a daughter was born to them. This damsel was carried away by the King Citrāṅgada. The hermit Jābāli cursed Citrāṅgada to become a leper. (Skanda Purāṇa. Chapters 3, 143, and 144)."
