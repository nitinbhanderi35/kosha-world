But three yatis, Bṛhadgiri, Rayovāja and Pṛthuraśmi were taken care of by Indra and Indra taught them Brahmavidyā, Kṣatriyavidyā and Vaiśyavidyā. <dvsn n='NI'/>Pṛthuraśmi compelled Indra to grant him Kṣātratejas also along with Kṣātravidyā. There is now a sāma even in the name of Pṛthuraśmi. (Pañca-viṃśa-Brāhmaṇa)."
