Rāma sent Lakṣmaṇa to Kiṣkindhyā to threaten Sugrīva. Sugrīva, however, said that he had despatched monkeys in all directions to find out Sītā. After a month those who had been sent to the north, the east, and the west returned. After two months Hanūmat, Aṅgada, etc., returned from the south, after having pillaged Madhuvaṇa (<i>b</i>). Hanūmat told that in a cavern of the palace of Maya the ascetic Prabhāvatī had shown them the way; on the shore they had seen the mountains Sahya, Malaya, and Dardura, then they had met Sampāti, the brother of Jaṭāyu(s) (<i>c</i>), and had informed him of everything; Sampāti then had directed them to Laṅkā (<i>d</i>), whereafter Hanūmat had crossed the ocean and slain the Rākṣasī of the water, and had been recognized by Sītā from the words of Avindhya; Sītā had given him a jewel as a credential and told him, as a token, that Rāma on the mountain Citrakūṭa had shot a blade of grass at a crow; Hanūmat then had caused himself to be seized by the soldiers of Rāvaṇa, and set fire to Laṅkā."
