Ambā, however, had been previously betrothed to a king of Śāla and Bhīṣma sent her to him; but the latter rejected her because she had been in another man's house.

Śiva favoured her and promised her the desired vengeance in another birth. Afterwards she was born as <lbinfo n='Śikhaṇ+ḍinī'/> Śikhaṇḍinī, daughter of Drupada, who came to be called Śikhaṇḍin and <lbinfo n='be+came'/> became the cause of Bhīṣma's death.] <b>--5</b> A term in astrology to denote the fourth condition.
