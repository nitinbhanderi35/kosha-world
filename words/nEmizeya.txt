There is a story about it in Mahābhārata as follows:— <dvsn n='NI'/>The Yajña conducted by Śaunaka at Naimiṣāraṇya ended in the twelfth year. The Ṛṣis who came from various parts of the country were put up in āśramas built on the banks of river Sarasvatī. But, many Ṛṣis did not get accommodation there and they moved eastwards. The River Sarasvatī which felt sorry that the Ṛṣis could not be accommodated also turned and moved eastwards, and thus afforded space for āśramas to be built on her banks. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 37)."
