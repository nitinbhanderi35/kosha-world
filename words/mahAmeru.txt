The seat of Lord Śiva, according to the Purāṇas. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>General features.</i> Mahāmeru surpasses even the sun in its dazzling golden brilliance. Devas and Gandharvas attend on it on all sides. It is inaccessible to sinners. There are celestial herbs and serpents at its base. It is Mahāmeru that keeps Heaven in its place by supporting it. The atmosphere there, is always alive with the sweet songs of various kinds of birds. Precious stones are scattered all over its surface. All the 33 crores of gods dwell on the sides of this Mountain. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 17). <dvsn n='NI'/>Saptarṣis like Vasiṣṭha rise and fall on Mahāmeru. Mahā Viṣṇu and Brahmā have their places in Mahāmeru. Viṣṇu's place is in the east. There is a special place there for the residence of Maharṣis. Those who go to Mahāmeru never return. The Sun and Moon go round. Mahāmeru everyday. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 163). <dvsn n='NI'/>There are twenty mountains surrounding Mahāmeru. On the eastern side there are two mountains, Jāra and Devakūṭa. On the western side there are two mountains, Pavamāna and Pāriyātra. On the southern side are the two mountains, Kailāsa and Karavīra and on the northern side, the two mountains, Triśṛṅga and Makaragiri. Thus Mahāmeru shines like the sun in the midst of eight mountains. In the middle of Mahāmeru is situated Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā in a square extending over 10,000 yojanas. This region is of inexpressible splendour. At eight places around this Brahmapurī, are situated the eight posts or abodes of the Aṣṭadikpālas, each of the abodes being 25000 yojanas in extent. Thus there are nine Purīs or Cities on the top of Mahāmeru. They are:— (1) Brahmā's Manovatī in the centre. (2) Due east of it, Indra's Amarāvatī. (3) In the south-east corner, Agni's Tejovatī. (4) On the southern side, Yama's Saṃyamanī. (5) In the south west corner, Nirrti's Kṛṣṇāñjana, (6) On the western side, Varuṇa's Śraddhāvatī. (7) In the north-west corner, Vāyu's Gandhavatī. (8) On the northern side, Kubera's Mahodaya. (9) In the north cast corner, Īśān'as Yaśovatī. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Mahāmeru and Laṅkā.</i> Rāvaṇa's place of abode Laṅkā was really a peak of Mahāmeru. (For further details, see the previous history of Laṅkā in Para 5 under the word Kubera). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>How Mahāmeru got its golden colour.</i> The Purāṇas declare that the sun keeps going round Mahāmeru. Once, while the sun was thus going round, he wished to take a little rest. He asked permission to place the axle of his chariot for a short while on Mahāmeru. The mountain agreed to it. The grateful Sungod (Sūrya) blessed Mahāmeru that it would thenceforth have golden colour. Until it received this blessing, Mahāmeru had the colour of ordinary mountains. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Two daughters named Āyati and Niyati were born to Mahāmeru. They were married by Dhātā and Vidhātā respectively. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter 10). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Vasiṣṭha had an āśrama near Mahāmeru. (M.B. Ādi Parva. Chapter 99, Verse 6). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Mahāmeru attends on Kubera in Kubera's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 73). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) The extensive Jambū Vṛkṣa stands on the southern side of Mahāmeru. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) At the time of Emperor Pṛthu, the earth was turned into a cow and all living beings obtained all their necessaries by milking her. It was Mahāmeru who stood as milking man on behalf of the mountains. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69, Verse 18). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vi) In Tripuradahana, it was Mahāmeru which was erected as the flag-staff in Śiva's chariot. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 202, Verse 78). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vii) Mahāmeru presented two Pārṣadas named Kāñcana and Meghamālī to Subrahmaṇya. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 48). <dvsn n='NI'/>(viii) Mahāmeru once presented heaps of gold to Emperor Pṛthu. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 1). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ix) Mahāmeru is anointed as the King of mountains. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 18). <dvsn n='NI'/>(x) Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 341, Verse 22 says that Vyāsa once stayed on Mahāmeru with his disciples. <dvsn n='NI'/>(xi) Sthūlaśiras and Baḍavāmukha once performed tapas on Mahameru. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 342, Verse 59)."
