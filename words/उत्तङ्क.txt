Pauṣyap.): <i>U</i>. was the disciple of <i>Veda</i>; having resisted the temptations of the wife of <i>Veda</i>, he obtained leave to depart, but first wished to bring <i>Veda</i> some gratuity for his instruction, and having uttered this wish two times, he was ordered to procure the ear-rings of <i>Pauṣya's</i> queen for the wife of <i>Veda</i>. Having met with a bull (<i>Airāvata</i>) and a man (<i>Indra</i>) mounted upon it, he ate of the dung and drank of the urine (<i>amṛta</i>) of that bull, “as his master had formerly done.” Coming to the abode of <i>Pauṣya</i>, he could not discover the queen before he had purified himself properly from the leavings of his last meal. He and <i>Pauṣya</i> cursed one another. Having obtained the ear-rings, <i>U</i>. returned to his master. On the road <i>Takṣaka</i>, the king of the serpents, in the shape of a mendicant, stole the ear-rings and proceeded to <i>Nāgaloka. Indra</i>, with the thunderbolt, made a hole through which <i>U</i>. entered the <i>Nāgaloka</i>, where he hymned the serpents. He there saw two damsels (= <i>Dhātṛ</i> and <i>Vidhātṛ</i>) sitting over a loom, weaving a fabric with black and white threads (night and day), further, he saw a wheel (= the year) with twelve spokes (= the months) turned by six boys (= the seasons), and then a man (<i>Parjanya</i>) mounted on a horse (<i>Agni</i>). At the injunction of the man <i>U</i>. blew into the anus of the horse, whence there issued flames of fire with smoke, which were about to consume the <i>Nāgaloka</i>. <i>Takṣaka</i> then gave back the ear-rings and <i>U</i>. was borne by the horse to his master's abode. His master explained to him all he had seen during his journey. <i>U</i>. then proceeded to <i>Hāstinapura</i> and told <i>Janamejaya</i>, who had some time before returned victorious from <i>Takṣaśilā</i>, to burn <i>Takṣaka</i>, who had bitten <i>Parikṣit</i> to death, and caused <i>Kāśyapa</i> to turn back without relieving <i>Parikṣit</i>, at a snake-sacrifice: I, <b>3</b>, ††747 (<i>°nāmānaṃ</i>), ††748, ††749, ††753, ††756, ††757 (<i>Utta°</i> also C.), ††758, ††759, ††761, ††762, ††763, ††764, ††765, ††770, ††771, ††772, ††773, ††776, ††778, ††779, ††780, ††787, ††789, ††790, ††791, ††793, ††796, ††805, ††815, ††816, ††818, ††819, ††820, ††821, ††822, ††823, ††832, 833, (836), (840), 848, 849, 850.—§ 56 (Parikṣit): I, <b>50</b>, 1991 (<i>ṛṣer U°sya</i>, sc. <i>parābhavaṃ</i>, all. to § 17).—§ 57 (Janamejaya): I, <b>50</b>, 2014 (<i>°sya priyaṃ kartuṃ</i>, do.).— § 474<i>b</i> (Dhundhumārop.): III, <b>201</b>, 13491 (<i>maharṣiḥ</i>), 13492, (13494), 13504, (13505), 13507 (gratified Viṣṇu who granted him boons).—§ 476 (do.): III, <b>202</b>, 13523, 13524, (13525); <b>203</b>, 13546, 13550 (<i>U</i>. urged Bṛhadaśva to slay Dhundhu, but Bṛhadaśva directed him to Kuvalāśva). —§ 478 (do.): III, <b>204</b>, 13589 (<i>°āśramaṃ</i>), 13591 (<i>°āśramā-</i> <i>bhyāse</i>, there Dhundhu had his abode), 13592, 13594, 13619 (<i>U</i>. accompanied Kuvalāśva when he set out to slay Dhundhu). —§ 784<i>b</i> (Anugītāp.): When <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, on his way from <i>Hāstinapura</i> to <i>Dvārakā</i>, had entered the desert, he beheld <i>U.</i>, who enquired whether he came after having reconciled the <i>Kurus</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas. Kṛṣṇa</i> told him the matter; filled with wrath <i>U</i>. threatened to curse him; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> warned <i>U</i>. (who had practised <i>brahmacarya</i> from the day of his infancy) against destroying his penances [by a curse] (XIV, <b>53</b>). <i>U</i>. agreed that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> should first tell him “that faultless adhyātma”, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> explained his own identity with the creator and destroyer of all things. “R., V., Dai., Y., G., Rā., N., and Aps. have sprung from me; etc. <i>Dharma</i>, whose essence is compassion for all creatures, is my eldest-born offspring, and has sprung from my mind; I am <i>Viṣṇu, Brahmán</i>, and <i>Śakra</i> (i.e. Indra).” He always acts as those beings in whose order he lives (XIV, <b>54</b>). <i>U</i>. prevailed upon <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to show him his eternal <i>Vaiṣṇava</i> or universal form, and praised <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who granted him the boon to have water wherever he wished for it (water being scarce in such deserts) by thinking of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. Once, when <i>U</i>. was wandering thirsty in the desert, and thought of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, he saw a naked <i>Cāṇḍāla (mātaṅga</i>) all besmeared with dirt, surrounded by a pack of dogs, and carrying a sword, and bow, and arrows; from his urinary organs there issued copious streams of water; he invited <i>U</i>. to accept this water; <i>U</i>. refused and even censured <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, the <i>Cāṇḍāla</i> disappeared. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came and said that the <i>Cāṇḍāla</i> was <i>Indra</i>, whom he had ordered to give <i>amṛta</i> to <i>U</i>. in the form of water, and that <i>Indra</i> at first had refused to do it, but at last had agreed on the condition that <i>U</i>. should accept it in that way. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> ordained that on those days in which <i>U</i>. would feel a desire for water, there should rise clouds raining savoury water over this desert and that they should be named <i>U</i>.-clouds; even to this day such clouds shower rain on the arid desert (XIV, <b>55</b>): Asked by <i>Janamejaya</i> about the penances of <i>U., Vaiśampāyana</i> related that <i>U.'s</i> preceptor <i>Gautama</i>, having permitted thousands of disciples to return home, was so pleased with the devotion of <i>U</i>. that he would not dismiss him, even after 100 years, and decrepitude overtook <i>U.</i>; one day when he threw the load of fuel he had fetched on the earth, one of his matted locks, white as silver, had become entangled with the load and fell on the earth; beholding that sign of old age, <i>U</i>. gave himself up to loud lamentations; the beautiful daughter of his preceptor, at the command of her father, sought to hold the tears of <i>U</i>. in her hands, but her hands seemed to burn with the dropping tears, and she was obliged to let them fall on the earth; the earth was unable to hold them. Asked by <i>Gautama, U</i>. explained the matter. <i>Gautama</i> permitted him to leave him; as <i>U</i>. spoke of the fee, <i>Gautama</i> said that he was already highly gratified and that if <i>U</i>. became a young man of sixteen years, he would give him his daughter in marriage. <i>U</i>. again became a youth and accepted the maiden. As he spoke of the fee to his preceptor's wife, <i>Ahalyā</i> said that she was already gratified. <i>U.</i>, however, insisted, and <i>Ahalyā</i> then commanded him to bring her the celestial ear-rings which were borne by the wife of <i>Saudāsa</i>, who had [through the curse of <i>Śaktri</i>] become a cannibal. <i>Gautama</i> blamed <i>Ahalyā</i> that she had sent <i>U</i>. to the cannibal. <i>Ahalyā</i> said that she had done it unknowingly, and that <i>Gautama</i> would protect <i>U. U</i>. met <i>Saudāsa</i> in a deserted forest (XIV, <b>56</b>). <i>Saudāsa</i> was of frightful mien, wearing a long beard smeared with human blood, and looking like a second <i>Yama</i>; he congratulated himself that he had met <i>U</i>. at the sixth hour of the day when he was in search of food; <i>U</i>. maintained that while one is employed for the sake of his preceptor, one should not be injured; at last they agreed that when he had brought his preceptor the ear-rings he should come back; <i>Saudāsa</i> told <i>U</i>. to go and see the queen <i>Madayantī</i> (near a forest fountain), as he could not himself see her at the sixth hour. <i>Madayantī</i> told <i>U</i>. to bring her some sign from her husband, as these ear-rings, when placed on the earth, would be stolen by the <i>Nāgas</i>, if worn by one who is impure from eating, they would be taken away by the <i>Yakṣas</i>, and if the wearer fell asleep, the gods would take them away; “also the <i>maharṣis</i> and the <i>Rākṣasas</i> watch for opportunities for carrying them away; they always produce gold and shine brightly at night; they protect against hunger, and thirst, and fear, and he who wears them grows in size” (XIV, <b>57</b>). <i>U</i>. came back to <i>Saudāsa</i>, who gave him a sign. When he had got the ear-rings, <i>U</i>. once more came back to <i>Saudāsa</i>, and asked him about the meaning of the mystic words he had caused him to say to <i>Madayantī</i>, as a sign. <i>Saudāsa</i>, referring to his own terrible condition in consequence of his being cursed [by <i>Śaktri</i>], said that he hoped that this gift to a brahman might save him. <i>U</i>. asked <i>Saudāsa</i> to give him such advice as is approved by the wise: “is it proper for me to come back to thee or not?” <i>Saudāsa</i> said that he would then tell him never to come back. When <i>U.</i>, on his way to <i>Ahalyā</i>, having bound the ear-rings in the folds of his black deerskin, had proceeded for some distance he became afflicted with hunger and climbed a <i>bilva</i>-tree (ægle marmelos), hanging his deerskin on a branch, while he plucked some fruits. Struck by some fruits the deerskin fell down, the knot was untied, and a serpent of <i>Airāvata's</i> race carried the ear-rings, holding them in his mouth, into an anthill. Filled with wrath, <i>U</i>. with his staff, pierced that anthill for thirty-five days, desirous of making a path to the nether regions; the goddess Earth became anxious; <i>Indra</i> came there in the disguise of a brahman afflicted with the sorrow of <i>U.</i>, and told him that the regions of the <i>Nāgas</i> are thousands of <i>yojanas</i> distant; as <i>U</i>. did not desist, <i>Indra</i> united the latter's staff with his thunderbolt, and struck with the thunderbolt, the earth opened a way to the <i>Nāgaloka</i> (<i>c). U</i>. entered the <i>Nāgaloka</i>, very cheerless; then there appeared to him a black steed with a white tail, whose face and eyes were of coppery hue. He told <i>U</i>. to blow into his anus, “which thou often didst at the retreat of <i>Gautama</i> in former days”; the horse turned out to be Agni; <i>U</i>. did as he was directed, a thick smoke enveloped the <i>Nāgaloka</i>, the <i>Nāgas</i>, headed by <i>Vāsuki</i>, gave <i>U</i>. the ear-rings, which he brought to <i>Ahalyā</i> (XIV, <b>58</b>): XIV, <b>53</b>, 1542 (<i>muniśreṣ-</i> <i>ṭhaṃ</i>), 1544 (<i>brāhmaṇaśreṣṭhaḥ</i>), 1555, (1556); <b>54</b>, (1563); <b>55</b>, (1586), (1593), 1596, 1599, 1600, 1601, 1604, 1608, 1610, 1612, 1614, 1623 (<i>°meghāḥ</i>), 1624 (do.); <b>56</b>, 1625, 1626, 1628, 1630, 1632, 1638 (<i>vipraṃ</i>), (1640), (1645), 1653, 1656, 1657, 1660; <b>57</b>, (1664), (1666), (1673), (1675), 1676, (1678), 1680, 1681; <b>58</b>, 1692, (1699), (1701), 1721, (1723), 1730, 1734, 1737, 1746, 1750.—§ 784 (do.): XIV, <b>59</b>, 1751, 1752.
