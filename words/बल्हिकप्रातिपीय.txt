            "content": "2. <b>Balhika Prātipīya</b>¦ is the name of a <b>Kuru</b> king in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where he appears as having been opposed to the restoration of <b>Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana</b> to his hereditary sovereignty over the <b>Sṛñjayas,</b> but as having failed to prevent the restoration being carried out by <b>Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra</b> <b>Sthapati.</b> The epithet Prātipīya is curious: if it connects him with <b>Pratīpa</b> (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is remarkable, Zimmer<sup>2</sup> indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya. In the Epic and the Purāṇas<sup>3</sup> he is in the form of Vāhlīka made a brother of <b>Devāpi</b> and <b>Śantanu,</b> and a son of Pratīpa. To base chronological conclusions on this<sup>4</sup> would be utterly misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be a late figure in the Vedic age, later than <b>Parikṣit,</b> being his great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name Balhika must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort regarding it. <F>1) xii. 9, 3, 3.</F> <F>2) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 432.</F> <F>3) See Muir, <i>Sanskrit Texts,</i> 12, 273 <i>et seq.;</i> Sieg, <i>Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda,</i> 131-136.</F> <F>4) Pargiter, <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic</i> <i>Society,</i> 1910, 52.</F>"
