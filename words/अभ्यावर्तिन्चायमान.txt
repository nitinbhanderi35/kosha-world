In this case he would be prince (<i>samrāj</i>) of the Sṛñjayas. Daivavāta is mentioned elsewhere<sup>3</sup> as a worshipper of Agni. <dvsn n='P'/>Abhyāvartin is also referred to as a Pārthava. Ludwig<sup>4</sup> and Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> maintained that he is thus a Parthian, the latter using the evidence of the two places mentioned in the description<sup>6</sup> of Daivavāta's victories, <b>Hariyūpīyā</b> and <b>Yavyāvatī,</b> as proofs for the western position of Abhyāvartin's people in Arachosia, in Iran. But Zimmer<sup>7</sup> is probably right in holding that the name Pārthava merely means ‘a descendant of Pṛthu,’ and that its similarity to the Iranian Parthians is only on a par with the numerous other points of identity between the Indian and Iranian cultures. <F>1) vi. 27, 8. 5.</F> <F>2) vi. 27, 7.</F> <F>3) iv. 15, 4.</F> <F>4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198 <i>et seq.</i></F> <F>5) <i>Vedische Mythologie,</i> 1, 105; 3, 268, n. 1. <i>Cf.</i> Grierson, <i>Journal of the Royal</i> <i>Asiatic Society,</i> 1908, 604 <i>et seq.</i></F> <F>6) Rv. vi. 27, 5. 6.</F> <F>7) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 133 <i>et seq.,</i> 433; Bergaigne, <i>Religion Védique,</i> 2, 362.</F>"
