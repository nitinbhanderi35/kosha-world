            "content": "[<b>Sauptikaparvan(°va)</b>]¦ (“the section including the nightly attack”: (<i>a</i>) the 10th of the greater parvans of Mhbhr., including the 83rd and the 84th of the minor parvans; (<i>b</i>) the 83rd of the minor parvans; cf. Sauptika): § 616: <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. proceeded towards the south. At the hour of sunset they reached a spot near the encampment. Hearing the shouts in the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> camp, they proceeded farther and reached a dense forest. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> interrupted <i>Sañjaya</i> by expressing his grief for <i>Duryodhana</i>, and then inquired about the acts of the three survivors (α). <i>Sañjaya</i> continued: <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc., laid themselves down for rest under a huge banyan; <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i> fell asleep; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> was kept awake by wrath and the desire of vengeance. He saw a fierce owl coming to that banyan and slaying a large number of crows roosting on its branches; at this sight he formed the resolution of slaying the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army while buried in sleep; he roused <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, unfolded his project before them, and asked for their advice (X, <b>1</b>); <i>Kṛpa</i> dissuaded him from executing his wicked design; “Let us repair to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī</i>, and <i>Vidura</i>, and ask them as to what we should do” (X, <b>2</b>); <i>Aśvatthāman</i> tried to refute <i>Kṛpa's</i> arguments (β) (X, <b>3</b>). <i>Kṛpa</i> promised to aid <i>Aśvatthāman</i> if the latter would fight the foe the next morning during daylight (γ); <i>Aśvatthāman's</i> answer: he would not desist (δ) (X, <b>4</b>). <i>Kṛpa</i> earnestly remonstrated with <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who declared his resolution to be unaltered (ε), yoked his steeds to his chariot, and proceeded alone, saying that he would avenge his father (ζ); <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i> followed him. Approaching the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> camp, <i>Aśvatthāman</i> stopped at the gate (X, <b>5</b>). He beheld a being of gigantic frame (description; hundreds and thousands of <i>Hṛṣīkeśas</i> issued from its flames) ready to resist him, and fearlessly fought it; it devoured all the weapons of <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who repented of his rash deed, and resolved to seek the protection of <i>Mahādeva</i> (X, <b>6</b>), to whom he recited a hymn (η). A golden altar appeared before him with a blazing fire on it; many mighty beings of extraordinary appearance came there (description), worshippers of <i>Mahādeva. Aśvatthāman</i> felt no fear at the sight; he offered himself to <i>Mahādeva</i> as a libation on the fire; <i>Mahādeva</i> appeared and declared that the period of life of everybody in the camp had ran out; he gave a sword to <i>Aśvatthāman</i> and filled him with his own energy; many invisible beings and Rā. proceeded to his right and left as he set out (X, <b>7</b>). He asked <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i> to stand at the gate and slay everybody who would seek to escape; he entered the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> camp like a thief and slew <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (θ) (description; he employed the <i>Rudra</i> weapon); Rā. uttered loud roars in joy; also Y. came there; <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i> set fire to the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> camp in three places; “<i>Arjuna</i> is incapable of being vanquished by D., As., G., Y., and Rā.” Before midnight the vast host of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> was slain by <i>Aśvatthāman</i>; the camp was invaded by Rā. and Pś. that gorge upon blood and flesh. <i>Aśvatthāman</i> forgot his grief for his father; when morning dawned he issued from the camp and joined <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked why <i>Aśvatthāman</i> did not achieve such a feat before; <i>Sañjaya</i> answered that the absence of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, as also the sleep, was the cause of <i>Aśvatthāman's</i> success. They congratulated each other and resolved to give notice of the slaughter to <i>Duryodhana</i> (X, <b>8</b>). They beheld <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> still living, surrounded by wolves, hyenas, etc. They lamented and informed him (ι); <i>Aśvatthāman</i> asked him, when he came to heaven, to inform <i>Droṇa</i> and embrace <i>Bāhlīka</i>, etc. (κ), and informed him who were yet alive (λ) and who had been slain (μ). <i>Duryodhana</i> regained his senses and praised <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (ν). Saying “we shall all meet again in heaven”, he gave up his life-breaths; his soul ascended to heaven. At early dawn <i>Sañjaya</i> came to the city and lost his spiritual sight. <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc., ascended their chariots. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> breathed long and hot sighs (X, <b>9</b>)."
