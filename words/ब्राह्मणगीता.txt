The brahman discourses on acts; on the seat of the soul, where <i>Bráhman, Soma</i>, and <i>Agni</i>, etc., dwell, and for whose sake <i>Brahmán</i>, etc., in <i>Yoga</i>, worship the indestructible, etc.; the life-breaths <i>prāṇa</i>, etc. (α); in the midst of them is <i>Agni Vaiśvānara</i>, whose seven flames are the nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear, the mind, and the understanding (<i>boddhavyaṃ</i>), etc. (XIV, <b>20</b>). In this connection an ancient story is cited, viz. that of the institution of the ten <i>hotṛs</i>, i.e. the ear, the skin, the two eyes, the tongue, the nose, the two feet, the two hands, the genital organ, the lower duct, and speech; sound, etc., are the ten libations; the points of the compass, wind, sun, moon, earth, fire, <i>Viṣṇu, Indra, Prajāpati</i>, and <i>Mitra</i> are the ten fires, etc. (XIV, <b>21</b>); in this connection an ancient story is cited, viz. that of the institution of the seven <i>hotṛs</i>, the nose, the eye, the tongue, the skin, the ear, the mind, and the understanding (<i>buddhiḥ</i>), not knowing the qualities of one another; the nose, etc., and the understanding never succeed in apprehending doubt, it is the mind [alone] that apprehends it; the nose, etc., and the mind never succeed in apprehending determination; it is the understanding alone that apprehends it; in this connection this ancient narrative of a discourse between the senses and the mind is cited: as the nose does not smell, etc., without the mind, the mind thought itself to be the eternal and foremost one of all the elements; but the senses said that without them the mind would have no enjoyments at all, etc. (XIV, <b>22</b>); likewise the ancient story of the institution of the five <i>hotṛs: Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna</i>, <i>Samāna</i>, and <i>Vyāna</i>; the wind nursed by <i>Prāṇa > Apāna ></i> <i>Vyāna > Udāna > Samāna</i>; these asked <i>Brahmán</i> in days of yore as to which of them was the foremost; <i>Brahmán</i> said that he upon whose extinction all the life-breaths become extinct is the foremost; it turned out (as <i>Brahmán</i> said) that they are all foremost and not foremost, as they possess the attributes of one another (XIV, <b>23</b>); likewise the ancient story of the discourse between <i>Nāraca</i> and Ṛ. <i>Devamata. Devamata</i> said: Which part of a creature that takes birth comes first into existence, is it <i>Prāṇa</i> or <i>Āpāna</i>, etc.? <i>Nārada</i> seems to give the following explanation: <i>kāma</i> (desire) is (1—2) <i>samāna</i> and <i>vyāna</i>, which move transversely and alternately [from the man to the woman, and <i>vice versa?</i>] and have sprung from <i>sattva</i>; from <i>kāma</i> springs the vital seed [in the man] and the <i>rajas</i> or blood [in the woman]; from the union of these two springs (3) <i>prāṇa</i>, and from the seed being modified by <i>prāṇa</i> springs (4) <i>apāna</i>; these two move up and down and represent the two libations in the [mystical] fire; from the sexual intercourse of the loving pair springs <i>harṣa</i> (pleasure), which is (5) <i>udāna</i> = the fire between <i>prāṇa</i> and <i>apāna</i> = the fire between day and night = the fire between <i>sat</i> (the existent) and <i>asat</i> (the nonexistent) = [the union between <i>Samāna</i> and (Nīl.)] <i>Vyāna</i> <i>= Śānti</i> (tranquillity) = eternal <i>Bráhman</i> (“as the brahmans know”); in fire the smoke is <i>tamas</i> (darkness), and the ashes <i>rajas</i> (passion). [Nīl. takes all the expressions figuratively in a philosophical sense; according to him the seed (<i>śukra</i>) is = <i>adṛṣṭa</i>, i.e. the <i>karman</i> of past lives, the blood (<i>śoṇitaṃ</i>) = attachment to the objects of sense, <i>prāṇa = liṅgātman</i>, <i>apāna</i> = death, etc.] (XIV, <b>24</b>); likewise the ancient story of the <i>Cāturhotra</i>, i.e. the sacrifice with four <i>hotṛs</i>; the instrument, the action, the agent, and emancipation; at the sacrifice of <i>yoga</i> the <i>Prāṇa</i> is the <i>Stotra</i>, etc. (β); people knowing <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> recite some Ṛcs; to <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> animals (i.e. the senses, Nīl.) were offered in days of yore; and some <i>Sāmans; Nārāyaṇa</i> is the soul of all (XIV, <b>25</b>); †there is one ruler, residing in the heart, etc.; instructed by him the seven Ṛ.'s shine in the firmament; having lived with that instructor. <i>Indra</i> attained to the sovereignty of all the worlds. There is one enemy, residing in the heart; instructed by him all snakes are always hated (†v. 746—750). In this connection the old story of the instruction of the snakes, the gods (and As.), and Ṛ. by <i>Prajāpati</i> is cited; asked by them what is highly beneficial, he said <i>om</i>, i.e. <i>Bráhman</i> in one syllable; then they ran away in various directions from desire of selfinstruction; first arose in the snakes the disposition of biting; in the As. the disposition for ostentatious pride; the gods betook themselves to gifts, and M.-ṛ. to self-restraint (XIV, <b>26</b>). The brahman compared the world to an impassable fastness (<i>durgaṃ</i>), and <i>Bráhman</i> to a great forest; asked by his wife, he described this forest copiously (XIV, <b>27</b>); “it is not I, but nature that smells scents, etc.” In this connection an ancient discourse between an <i>adhvaryu</i> and a <i>yati</i> is recited: Beholding an animal sprinkled with water at a sacrificial ceremony, a <i>yati</i> blamed the <i>adhvaryu</i> for that destruction of life. The <i>Adhvaryu</i> appealed to the <i>Vedas</i>, saying, “This goat will not be destroyed, but will be benefited; that part of it which is of earth will go to earth,” etc.; the <i>yati</i> said that if the sacrifice was to the benefit of the goat, then the goats ought to give their consent; “abstention from cruelty is alone worthy of approbation; one should be guided by perception”; the <i>adhvaryu</i> objected that by smelling what belongs to the earth, etc., one takes life, as all these entities have life; the <i>yati</i> distinguished between the indestructible and the destructible of the soul (<i>ātmanaḥ</i>); of these only the indestructible is really existent; to him who is freed from all existent objects there is no fear; the <i>adhvaryu</i> admires and praises him, and says that he has no fault by performing those rites according to the <i>mantras</i>; the <i>yati</i> remained silent; the <i>adhvaryu</i> proceeded with the sacrifice (XIV, <b>28</b>). Follows the ancient story about the 1,000-armed king <i>Kārtavīryārjuna</i> and the Ocean; v. <i>Arjuna Kārtavīrya</i> (<i>c</i>) and <i>Paraśu-Rāma (d</i>) (XIV, <b>29</b>) with <i>Alarka (e</i>) (XIV, <b>30</b>). The brahman said: There are three foes in the world (i.e. ninefold, on account of the three guṇas); exultation, satisfaction, and joy 〈 goodness; desire, wrath, and hatred 〈 passion; lassitude, sloth, and delusion 〈 darkness. Persons conversant with the ancient <i>kalpas</i> recite some verses which were sung in days of old by king <i>Ambarīṣa</i>, who had acquired a tranquil soul: “I have killed all foes, etc., but the greatest vice has not yet been destroyed by me…” (XIV, <b>31</b>). Then the old narrative of the discourse between a brahman and king <i>Janaka(f</i>) is cited (XIV, <b>32—33</b>). Asked by his wife as to how this knowledge may be acquired, the brahman said: Know that <i>Brāhmaṇī</i> (i.e. <i>buddhi</i>, Nīl.) is the [lower] <i>araṇī</i>, the preceptor the upper <i>araṇī</i>; penances and conversance with the scriptures turn the upper <i>araṇī</i>; knowledge is the fire produced. Asked by his wife about the symbol (<i>liṅgaṃ</i>) of <i>Bráhman</i> called <i>kṣetrajña</i>, the brahman answered that he is without symbols and qualities. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said: Then the mind of that brahman's wife, upon the destruction of the <i>kṣetrajña</i>, became that which is beyond the <i>kṣetrajñas</i>, in consequence of the knowledge of <i>kṣetra</i>. Asked by <i>Arjuna</i>, where now that brahman and his wife were, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said: “My mind (<i>manas</i>) is the brahman, my understanding (<i>buddhi</i>) is the <i>brāhmaṇī</i>; he who has been called <i>kṣetrajña</i> is I myself” (XIV. <b>34</b>)."
