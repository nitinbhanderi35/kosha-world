Fascinated by the irresistible charm of Amoghā, Brahmā had an involuntary emission of seminal fluid. He felt ashamed of his own weakness and left the Āśrama immediately. The Maharṣi who returned to the Āśrama soon after, came to know from his wife whose semen it was. He asked Amoghā to accept Brahma Deva's precious semen and not to let it be wasted. Being a devoted wife, she accepted it, but unable to bear the divine pregnancy, she deposited it in the water lying in the valley of the Yugandhara mountain. From that time, it became a place of holy bath, known as Lohita. It was by bathing in this holy water that Paraśurāma washed away his sin of annihilating the Kṣatriyas. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, 55)."
