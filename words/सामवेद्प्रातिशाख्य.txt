It is probable that there were some Pratisakhya works written dealing with the different branches or Sakhas of the Samaveda, as could be inferred from indirect references to such works. For instance in the Mahabhasya there is a passage 'ननु च भोश्छन्दोगानां सात्यमुग्रिराणायनीयाः अर्धमेकारमर्धमोकारं चाधीयते। ..पार्षदकृतिरेषां तत्रभवताम् ' which refers to such works At present, however, one such work common to the several branches of the Samaveda, called Rktantra is available, and it is called Samaveda Pratisakhya. It is believed to have been written by औदव्रजि and revised by शाकटायन."
