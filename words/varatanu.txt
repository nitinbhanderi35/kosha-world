In the rebirth his name was Śrīdhara. He lived with his wife Prabhāvatī for a long time, but did not get children. When the hermit Vyāsa came to his palace once, the King asked him for the reason of his remaining childless. Vyāsa replied “Oh King, hear why you have only one wife and why you do not get children. In the previous birth you had been a brahmin named Varatanu. Your wife was called Śaṅkarī. When both of you were going somewhere once, you happened to see a lowcaste child falling into water. Without paying any heed to it, you went on your way. The child was drowned. Though both of you have taken births in royal families due to the several good deeds of yours, you have become childless because of that one sinful act.” <dvsn n='NI'/>According to the instruction of Vyāsa, he gave Brahmins alms of gold, clothes, oxen, pumpkin etc. and performed Bāla vrata, the rite for the sake of children. Thus he got remission of his sin. Within a year he got a son loved and respected by everyone. That handsome prince became an emperor who came to be the founder of a dynasty. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa, Chapter 6)."
