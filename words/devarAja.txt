Once he met a whore at the bathing pool and got so inextricably tied up with her that he killed his parents and wife for her sake. Then one day he had to go to Pratiṣṭhānanagara on business where he heard sacred stories being read. He had also a glimpse of the divine. A month after that he died. Though an evil fellow, because of his having worshipped Śiva for a month he had the good fortune to go to Mount Kailāsa after his death. (Śiva Purāṇa Māhātmyam)."
