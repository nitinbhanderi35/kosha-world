Although the people of India always believed in the greatness of the Vedas, the Vedas became unintelligible even to scholars owing to changes in language and differences in grammar. It was Yāska and Sāyaṇa who saved the country from that plight. Yāska became famous by composing “Nirukta” (etymology). There is a reference to this ancient sage in Mahābhārata, Chapter 342, Verse 72."
