No. 33 gives his titles as <i>‘parama-</i> <i>daivata’, ‘paramabhaṭṭāraka’</i> and <i>‘mahārājādhirāja’.</i> In No. 53 he is mentioned as the son of Pūrugupta born of the queen Candradevī.<sup>96</sup> In No. 55 his title is <i>Mahārājādhirāja.</i> According to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other Gupta prince between Pūrugupta and Bhudhagupta and their relationship is clearly mentioned by the word <i>‘putra’</i> occurring at the end of line 6.<sup>97</sup> In other words pūrugupta was the father of Budhagupta. <dvsn n='P'/>In his description of Nālandā, Hiuen Tsang says that the monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgatagupta and Bālāditya.<sup>98</sup> On the strength of this statement it has been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I who had the title of <i>Mahendrāditya</i> (Mahendra = Śakra).<sup>99</sup> In view of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.<sup>100</sup> The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line. <dvsn n='P'/>The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury. Budhism had quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view of the special leaning of Gupta kings towards the brahmanical faith we prefer to interpret Budha as referring to Mercury either as god Mercury (regarded as a son of Soma or the Moon) or as the planet Mercury.<sup>101</sup>"
