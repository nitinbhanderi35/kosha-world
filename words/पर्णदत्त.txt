Sankalia considers it to be an Iranian name.<sup>23</sup> But it can can very well be an Indian name. Parṇa means a leaf and is as well the name of a tree called Palāśa. We find ‘Parṇadatta’ to be the name of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>24</sup> It signifies ‘a person born as a result of the worship of the Parṇa (Palāśa) tree’."
