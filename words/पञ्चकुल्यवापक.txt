Literally it means ‘a plot of land five kulyavāpas in area: It seems to refer to a village or locality comprising five kulyavāpas of land.<sup>672</sup> A kulyavāpa is ‘an area of land requiring one kulya measure of seed grains to be sown’.<sup>673</sup> This land measure differed in different ages and localities. Maity<sup>674</sup> gives this area of five kulyavāpas in terms of modern measurements as follows: <dvsn n='P'/>5 kulyavāpas = 1 pāṭaka = 192-240 bighās = 72-88 acres and believes the lower figures to be more correct."
