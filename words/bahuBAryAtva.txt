It is said in the Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 10, Anuvāka 3, Sūkta 11 that the bride should proceed to the house of the husband, after the marriage. A spell (mantra) meant for keeping down one's co-wife, is seen in the Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 10, Anuvāka 11, Sūkta 17. It is a prayer to destroy the love of husband for a co-wife and to direct that love towards oneself. The deity of this spell is Indrāṇī the wife of Indra who was a polygamist. In those days marriage was an essential duty. Widow marriage was not forbidden."
