That beats all!</i> Once, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.286.1〕, jitaṃ (<ab>v.l.</ab> jidaṃ) occurs by itself; the daughters of Māra, reporting to Māra, say: (any other man than the Bodhisattva, seeing us,) so jitaṃ mūrchitvā prapatiṣyad vā … cittakṣayaṃ vā prāpuṇe (but the <ab n='Bodhisattva'>B.</ab> was unmoved); here too <i>astonishment</i> might be the connotation of the particle; <i>he, good heavens! would have fallen down fainting …, or lost his wits</i>. No etymology is apparent for the word."
