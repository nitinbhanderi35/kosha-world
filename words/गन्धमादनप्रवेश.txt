Tīrthayātrāp.): <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in vain proposed that <i>Bhīma</i> should return with <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, <i>Sahadeva, Dhaumya</i>, the charioteers, cooks, etc., to <i>Gaṅgā-</i> <i>dvāra</i>, while <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> should proceed with <i>Nakula</i> and <i>Lomaśa. Bhīma</i> promised to carry <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> and the twins. <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> said that she would be able to go. They entrusted to the <i>Pulinda</i> king (v. 10866, <i>Kulindānāṃ</i>) <i>Subāhu</i> on the <i>Himavat</i> (inhabited by <i>Kirātas, Taṅgaṇas</i>, and <i>Pulindas</i>), the servants <i>Indrasena</i>, etc., the cooks and stewards, and <i>Draupadī's</i> accoutrements, and began to proceed (III, <b>140</b>).— § 420: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> complained to <i>Bhīma</i> that he had not seen <i>Arjuna</i> for five years. They now should, in company with brahmans of strict vows, enter <i>Gandhamādana (b</i>), etc. (III, <b>141</b>).—§ 421: Exhorted by <i>Lomaśa</i>, when they were about to go to the mountain <i>Mandara (b</i>), they adored <i>Ākāśagaṅgā</i> (v. 10902, read with B. <i>puṇyā</i> for <i>puśyā</i>) (<i>c</i>), and then proceeded with the <i>ṛṣis</i>.—§ 422: Then they saw the bones of the <i>Daitya Naraka (b</i>) like to a white mountain.—§ 422 <i>bis</i>: Varāhāvatāra (q.v.), III, <b>142</b>.—§ 423: As they, with the brahmans, entered <i>Gandhamādana (b</i>) a terrible wind arose, followed by showers of rain, lightning, and torrents, during which they took shelter under trees, etc., <i>Sahadeva</i> carrying the sacred fire (<i>agnihotrāṇi</i>). When the tempest was over and the sun reappeared, they continued their journey (III, <b>143</b>). When they had proceeded only a <i>krośa, Draupadī</i> sank down. <i>Nakula</i> ran forward and supported her, and the others hastily came, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> took her on his lap and lamented. <i>Dhaumya</i> and the other brahmans comforted and blessed him, and by reciting <i>mantras</i> capable of dispelling <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and by performing ceremonies, while she was touched and fanned by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, they made her regain her senses. The twins pressed her feet with their hands. <i>Bhīma</i> promised <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to carry them all over the snowy mountains, “or <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> will carry us all.” With <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> permission <i>Bhīma</i> thought of <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, who immediately came and was embraced by <i>Bhīma</i> (III, <b>144</b>). <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> carried <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> through the air, and hundreds of other <i>Rākṣasas</i> carried the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the brahmans, while <i>Lomaśa</i> moved along the path of the <i>Siddhas</i>. So they proceeded through regions inhabited by <i>Mlecchas, Vidyā-</i> <i>dharas</i>, monkeys, <i>Kinnaras, Kimpuruṣas, Gandharvas</i>, etc., and the northern <i>Kurus</i>, towards <i>Kailāsa</i> and <i>Badarī (c</i>), where they were received by the numerous <i>ṛṣis</i>, and where they dwelt, beholding <i>Maināka, Hiraṇyaśikkara, Bindusaras</i>, and <i>Bhāgīrathī</i>, and offering oblations, etc. (III, <b>145</b>)"
