            "content": "<b>Pañca-janāḥ,</b>¦ the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various names in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup> Who are meant by the five is very uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> explains the five to be gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers. Aupamanyava<sup>3</sup> held that the four castes (<b>Varṇa</b>) and the <b>Niṣādas</b> made up the five, and Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> is of the same opinion. Yāska<sup>5</sup> thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods, Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be regarded as probable. Roth<sup>6</sup> and Geldner<sup>7</sup> think that all the peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters (<b>Diś</b>), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer<sup>8</sup> opposes this view on the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is not in harmony with the distinction so often made between Āryan and Dāsa; that neither <i>janāsaḥ,</i> ‘men,’<sup>9</sup> nor <i>mānuṣāḥ,</i> ‘people,’<sup>10</sup> could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is referred to as being among the five tribes;<sup>11</sup> that the five tribes are mentioned as on the <b>Sarasvatī,</b><sup>12</sup> and that Indra is <i>pāñca-</i> <i>janya,</i><sup>13</sup> ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the <b>Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas,</b> and <b>Pūrus,</b> who are all mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the Rigveda,<sup>14</sup> and four of whom occur in another hymn.<sup>15</sup> But he admits that the expression might easily be used more generally later. Hopkins<sup>16</sup> has combated Zimmer's view, but his own opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa, and that theory is not very probable. <dvsn n='P'/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former work<sup>19</sup> seven peoples are alluded to. <F>1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 31; iv. 27; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 1, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 6; xxxii. 6; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 9 (<i>pañca-janāḥ</i> as a compound).

See Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204.

For his view, Av. iii. 24, 3, can be cited: <i>pañca</i> <i>pradiśo mānavīḥ pañca kṛṣṭayaḥ,</i> ‘the five directions, the five races of men.’</F> <F>7) <i>Siebenzig Lieder,</i> 18. See, however, <i>Ṛgveda, Glossar,</i> 103, where he recognizes the use of the phrase to denote five tribes, as well as all mankind.</F> <F>8) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 119-123. His view is accepted by Macdonell, <i>Sanskrit</i> <i>Literature,</i> 153; Muir, <i>Sanskrit Texts,</i> 1^2, 179, is doubtful.</F> <F>9) <i>Cf.</i> its use in Rv. ii. 12, <i>sa janāsa</i> <i>Indraḥ,</i> where the address must be to Āryan men.</F> <F>10) <i>Cf.</i> Rv. viii. 9, 2, and i. 52, 9, with viii. 70, 11; x. 28, 8.</F> <F>11) Rv. ix. 65, 23.</F> <F>12) Rv. vi. 61, 12 <i>(pañca jātā).

In vii. 18, cited by Zimmer, 122, the five tribes do not occur <i>eo nomine,</i> for <b>Yakṣu</b> replaces Yadu.
