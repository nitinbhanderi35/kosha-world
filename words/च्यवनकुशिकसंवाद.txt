Once he slept for twenty-one days, while <i>Kuśika</i> and the queen kept themselves awake, foregoing all food; then <i>Cyavana</i> went out, followed by the king and the queen, and disappeared (XIII, <b>52</b>); the king with the queen sorrowfully returned to the palace, where he found <i>Cyavana</i> stretched as before on his bed, and sat by his side, while he slept for twenty-one days; then <i>Cyavana</i> ordered them to rub him, and then entered the bathing house, and once more disappeared by means of his <i>yoga</i>-power. The next time, <i>C</i>. was seen on the throne; then he ordered food (description), but reduced it all to ashes, and disappeared. <i>Kuśika</i> with his queen stood there in the same posture the whole night without speaking a word, without giving way to wrath. So it went on every day. <i>Cyavana</i> failed to notice any fault in the conduct of the king. Then he ordered them to yoke themselves to a chariot and pull him along; it should be the king's battle-chariot with every weapon, etc., and the goad (description); they must drag him slowly in the sight of the people, who lamented; suddenly he struck them with the goad, so that they were covered with blood; no food had passed their lips for fifty nights; on his way he began to give away very largely of the king's property. Then <i>Cyavana</i>, delighted, came down from the chariot, unharnessed the royal couple, and granted them a boon; he softly touched them with his hands, the healing virtues of which were like ambrosia, and all their fatigue, etc., was dispelled, and they once more became endued with youth. He dismissed them till the next day, himself remaining on the banks of the <i>Gaṅgā</i>. Meanwhile <i>Cyavana</i>, by his <i>yoga</i>-power, converted that delightful wood on the bank of the <i>Gaṅgā</i> into a retreat full of wealth of every kind and jewels and gems (XIII, <b>53</b>). The next morning <i>Kuśika</i> came with his wife, and saw that palace made entirely of gold, etc. (description), and Aps. and G., and thought that it was the country of the <i>Uttara-Kurus</i> or <i>Indra's</i> abode <i>Amarāvatī. Cyavana</i> lay stretched on a costly and excellent bed, and at the same time on a mat of <i>kuśa</i>-grass. In a moment everything disappeared, Aps., G., etc. <i>Cyavana</i> praised <i>Kuśika</i> and his queen; <i>Kuśika</i> said that he had a sufficient boon, not having been consumed by the fire of <i>Cyavana's</i> penances; he asked him to expound some doubts (XIII, <b>54</b>). Asked by <i>Kuśika, Cyavana</i> explained the reason of his conduct: In days past, when the gods had assembled together, he had heard <i>Brahmán</i> say that, owing to a contention between <i>brahman-</i> and <i>kṣattriya-</i>energy, there would occur an intermixture in his race; therefore he had resolved to exterminate the <i>Kuśikas</i>, but had failed to find any fault with <i>Kuśika</i>; seeing the delightful palace he had created, <i>Kuśika</i> had had a foretaste of heaven and had become desirous of the status of a <i>brahman</i> and the merit of penances; “the person who will be the third in descent from thee shall attain to the status of a <i>brahman</i>; through the energy of the <i>Bhṛgus</i>, thy grandson will be an ascetic endued with the splendour of fire; I shall set out on a <i>tīrthayātrā.”</i> <i>Kuśika</i> asked in what way the status of brahmanhood would attach to his race (XIII, <b>55</b>). <i>Cyavana</i> foretold that the <i>Kṣattriyas</i> would exterminate the <i>Bhārgavas</i>, except <i>Ūrva</i>, who would cast the fire of his wrath into the mare's mouth (<i>Vaḍavā-vaktra</i>) in the Ocean; he would have a son <i>Ṛcīka</i>, to whom <i>Dhanurveda</i> in its incarnate form would come in order to exterminate all <i>Kṣattriyas</i>; he would communicate it to his son <i>Jamadagni</i>: <C n='1'/>Kuśika <C n='1'/>Gādhi <C n='2'/>Ūrva <C n='1'/>Viśvāmitra <C n='2'/>[Satyavatī]~Ṛcīka <C n='1'/>Jamadagni <C n='1'/>Rāma <i>Kuśika</i> became filled with joy; <i>Cyavana</i> set out on his <i>tīrtha-</i> <i>yātrā</i>; everything fell out as <i>Cyavana</i> had said (XIII, <b>56</b>). [Cf. Viśvāmitrop., § 721<i>b</i> = XIII, <b>4</b>.]"
