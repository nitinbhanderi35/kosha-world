Two sons were born of <i>Satyavatī, Citrāṅgada</i> and <i>Vicitravīrya</i>. Before the last had attained to majority, <i>Śāntanu</i> died and ascended to heaven, <i>Bhīṣma</i> placed <i>Citrāṅgada</i> on the throne. <i>Citrāṅgada</i> considered nobody his equal, not even the gods and <i>Asuras</i>. Therefore the king of the <i>Gandharvas</i> bearing the same name fought a three years' battle with him at <i>Kurukṣetra</i> on the banks of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, where <i>Citrāṅgada</i> was slain; then the <i>Gandharva</i> ascended to heaven. <i>Bhīṣma</i> installed <i>Vicitravīrya</i>, yet in his minority, on the throne of the <i>Kurus</i> and ruled for him. (For continuation v. Vicitravīryop.)"
