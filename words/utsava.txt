            "content": "UTSAVA¦. Celebrations conducted in temples from olden days. There are Śāstraic (scriptural) injunctions as regards conducting utsavas. Utsava is an indispensable celebration when once the deity (idol) is installed in the temple. Utsava should be celebrated for one day, three days or seven days in the very same month in which the deity was installed, because noncelebration of Utsava will render the installation ineffective. Utsava should be conducted either during Uttarāyaṇa (movement of the sun from south to North) or Viṣu (when the Sun is in the centre) or at a time suitable to the temple authorities who conduct the utsava in Śayana, Upavana or Gṛha. It should commence with auspicious ceremonies like the sowing of seeds of nine varieties of foodgrains, and with dance, song, instrumental music etc."
