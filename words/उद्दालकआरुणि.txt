            "content": "<b>Uddālaka Āruṇi.</b>¦ — Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāhmaṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was teacher of <b>Proti Kausurubindi</b> of Kauśāmbī,<sup>2</sup> and that his son <b>Svetaketu</b> is found disputing among the Pañcālas.<sup>3</sup> He was a pupil of Aruṇa, his father,<sup>4</sup> as well as of Patañcala Kāpya,<sup>5</sup> of Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya<sup>6</sup> Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki,<sup>7</sup> although the former is represented elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as having silenced him. He overcame in argument Prācīnayogya Śauceya,<sup>9</sup> and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājātaśatrava,<sup>10</sup> though the text here seems to read the name as Āraṇi. He was a Gautama,<sup>11</sup> and is often alluded to as such. As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>13</sup> the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>14</sup> and occasionally in the Aitareya,<sup>15</sup> the Kauṣītaki,<sup>16</sup> and the Ṣaḍviṃśa<sup>17</sup> Brāhmaṇas, as well as the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.<sup>18</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not mentioned, according to Geldner,<sup>19</sup> but only his father Aruṇa; his name does not occur, according to Weber,<sup>20</sup> in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> he is, as Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of <b>Divodāsa Bhaimaseni,</b> and in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> he is mentioned as serving <b>Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya.</b> In the Taittirīya tradition he seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>23</sup> to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>24</sup> Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.<sup>25</sup> But the episode of Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous <b>Śvetaketu,</b> who is expressly reported by Āpastamba<sup>26</sup> to have been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of importance for the date of Āruṇi. <F>1) xi. 4, 1, 2. <i>Cf.</i> Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6.</F> <F>2) xii. 2, 2, 13.</F> <F>3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1.</F> <F>4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 33 (in both recensions).</F> <F>5) <i>Ibid.,</i> iii. 7, 1.</F> <F>6) <i>Ibid.,</i> vi. 3, 15; 4, 33.</F> <F>7) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xv.</F> <F>8) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 7, 31.</F> <F>9) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 3, 1 <i>et seq.</i></F> <F>10) v. 5, 5, 14.

There is a chronological difficulty in taking Āruṇi as meant, since Ājātaśatrava must presumably have been a descendant of Ajātaśatru, a contemporary of Janaka (see Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1), who again was a patron of Yājñavalkya, a pupil of Āruṇi.
