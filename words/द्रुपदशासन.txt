Defeated by <i>Drupada</i>, they fell back upon the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. <i>Arjuna</i>, bidding <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> not to engage in the fight, appointed the sons of <i>Mādrī</i> his <i>cakrarakṣas</i>, while <i>Bhīmasena</i>, mace in hand, ran ahead to slay the elephants, while <i>Arjuna</i> attacked the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Sṛñjayas</i> and felled <i>Drupada</i> from his elephant. <i>Drupada</i> and <i>Satyajit</i> rushed at <i>Arjuna. Satyajit</i> had his bows repeatedly cut in twain and his horses, etc., slain, and desisted from the fight. <i>Drupada</i> also had his bow cut in twain, etc., by <i>Arjuna</i>, who then took a scimitar and, leaping from his own chariot upon that of his foe, seized <i>Drupada</i>, while the <i>Pāñcālas</i> ran away. <i>Bhīma</i>, etc., began to lay waste his capital, but were prevented by <i>Arjuna. Droṇa</i> prevailed upon <i>Drupada</i> to accept his friendship, and restored half his kingdom to him, viz., that part of it that lay on the southern side of the <i>Bhāgīrathī</i>, with the southern <i>Pāñcālas</i>, up to the banks of the <i>Carmaṇvatī</i> river, where <i>Drupada</i> thenceforth resided sorrowfully in <i>Kāmpilya</i> in <i>Mākandī</i>, on the banks of <i>Gaṅgā</i>, while <i>Droṇa</i> (because <i>Drupada</i> had said that only a king could be the friend of a king) retained that half that lay to the north of the <i>Bhāgīrathī</i>, and thenceforth continued to reside in <i>Ahicchatra</i> (I, <b>138</b>)."
