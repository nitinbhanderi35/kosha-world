No. 32 explains the basis of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta, produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues, and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons and gods.”<sup>77</sup> The poet means that Govindagupta resembled demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual virtues. <dvsn n='P'/>Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāragupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years, the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II (G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E. 96).<sup>78</sup> P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between A.D. 412 and 415.<sup>79</sup> That Govindagupta could have ruled as emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of Kumāragupta and his successors.<sup>80</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession, avoided all references to his elder brother.<sup>81</sup>"
