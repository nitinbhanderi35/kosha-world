The five souls of Śiva are the five āyatanas. They are Śānti (tranquillity), Atītaśānti (passed beyond tranquillity), Parāparavidyā (Greater and smaller knowledge), Pratiṣṭhā (celebrity) and Nivṛtti (Recession). Because these five āyatanas dwell in the idol of Śiva at Kāśī it got the name Pañcāyatana. (Chapter 34, Padma Purāṇa)."
