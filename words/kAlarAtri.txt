The fierce aspect of the Devatā is described in the Mahābhārata as follows:— <dvsn n='NI'/>Coal-black in colour, with swollen mouth and eyes and wearing red garlands and clothings—thus appeared the woman (Devatā) presiding over the death-night. With the fierce cord in her hand she drags away the souls of the dead. (Sauptika Parva, Chapter 9)."
