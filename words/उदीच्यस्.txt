Their relation to the Kurupañcālas appears also from the fact that in the same Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> reference is made to the speech of the north being similar to that of the Kurupañcālas. The speech of the Northerners was also celebrated for purity; hence Brāhmaṇas used to go to the north for purposes of study, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> while in the Buddhist texts the school of Takṣaśilā (in Gandhāra) is famous as a resort of students.<sup>4</sup> Possibly, too, Sanskrit was specially developed in Kaśmīr, as suggested by Franke.<sup>5</sup> See also <b>Kuru.</b> <F>1) xi. 4, 1, 1. <i>Cf.</i> Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6.</F> <F>2) iii. 2, 3, 15. <i>Cf.</i> Weber, <i>Indische</i> <i>Studien,</i> 1, 191; Lévi, <i>La Doctrine du</i> <i>Sacrifice,</i> 35.</F> <F>3) vii. 6. <i>Cf.</i> Weber, <i>op. cit.,</i> 1, 153; 2, 309.</F> <F>4) Rhys Davids, <i>Buddhist India,</i> 8, 28, 203.</F> <F>5) <i>Cf.
