But the Amarakośa gives a better explanation which takes us nearer to the original meaning. It explains <i>‘Dāman’</i> as <i>‘Sandānam’,</i> i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.<sup>2</sup> The second part of the name is <i>‘svāminī’</i> which means ‘a proprietress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).<sup>3</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The parents might have given her this name out of affection as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the cow while milking it.<sup>4</sup> The name indicates affection by the parents."
