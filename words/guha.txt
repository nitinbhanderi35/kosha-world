            "content": "GUHA¦. King of the country of Niṣādas alias Śṛṅgiverapura, on the banks of the river Gaṅgā. Śrī Rāma when he went on exile to the forests went to the residence of Guha accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā. Guha, a devotee of Rāma, received them with respect offering them many kinds of fruits and roots to eat. But Śrī Rāma said that it was not proper to accept fruits and roots and so he drank only pure water from him. But Guha was asked to feed his horse. At night when Lakṣmaṇa stood watch over Rāma and Sītā, Guha volunteered to stand guard but Lakṣmaṇa refused to accept the offer. So Guha kept company with Lakṣmaṇa and both of them spent the night talking to each other. In the morning as per Rāma's request Guha brought a canoe and Guha himself took Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā to the other side of the river. (Sarga 50, Vālmīki Rāṃāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Guha is seen next when Bharata comes to the forest in search of Rāma. When Bharata returned from Kekaya he went in search of Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa and came to Guha in Śṛṅgiverapura. Guha then gave Bharata all available information regarding Śrī Rāma. Guha then sent the Dāśa army along with Bharata. (Sarga 84, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Guha, chief of Śṛṅgiverapura, spent the night with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa under an Oka tree. (Chapter 6, Agni Purāṇa)."
