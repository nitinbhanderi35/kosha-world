Asked by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related <i>Prabhāsotpattikathana</i> (q.v.). Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> proceeded to <i>Camasodbheda</i>, where he passed one night and gave away costly gifts. Thence he proceeded to <i>Udapāna (b</i>) (IX, <b>35—36</b>), and thence to <i>Vinaśana</i> (IX, <b>36</b>), called so by the Ṛ. because the <i>Sarasvatī</i> has there become invisible from contempt of <i>Śūdras</i> and <i>Ābhīras</i>. Thence to <i>Subhū-</i> <i>mika (c), Gandharvāṇāṃ tīrtha (d), Gargasrotas (e</i>); thence (“smeared in white sandal-paste and attired in blue robes”) to <i>Śaṅkhatīrtha (f</i>); thence to the <i>Dvaita</i> lake; then, along the southern bank of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, to <i>Nāgadhanvan (g</i>). <i>Baladeva</i> then set out with his face towards the East, and one after another reached hundreds and thousands of <i>tīrthas</i> that occurred at every step. Bathing in all those <i>tīrthas</i>, and observing fasts, etc., as directed by Ṛ., and giving away wealth in profusion, etc., he (always smeared with white sandal-paste) set out for that spot where the <i>Sarasvatī</i> turns in an eastward direction in order to behold the Ṛ. in the forest of <i>Naimiṣa (h</i>), and he became filled with wonder. “There, at <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, O foremost one of <i>Kuru's</i> race, do thou perform great sacrifices and rites.” Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> went to the <i>tīrtha Saptasārasvata</i> (description), resorted to by <i>Vāneyas</i> and other ascetics, where the great ascetic crowned with success (<i>siddhaḥ</i>) performed his penances (IX, <b>37</b>). Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the history of <i>Saptasārasvata (i</i>) and <i>Maṅkaṇaka (j</i>) (IX, <b>38</b>). Having passed one night there, <i>Bala-Rāma</i> went to <i>Auśanasa tīrtha</i> (“the <i>tīrtha</i> of <i>Uśanas</i>”) <i>Kapālamocana</i>; the great <i>muni</i> <i>Mahodara</i>, whose thigh had been seized by the head of a Rā. slain by <i>Rāma</i> [Dāśarathi], was liberated. There <i>Kāvya</i> (i.e. Śukra, Uśanas) had performed <i>tapas</i>, and the whole science of politics and morals (<i>nīti</i>) was revealed to him, while meditating on the war of Dai. and Dā. Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the story of <i>Mahodara (k</i>). Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> went to the abode of <i>Ruṣaṅgu (l</i>), where <i>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa</i> had formerly undergone austere penances, and where the great <i>muni Viśvāmitra</i> had become a <i>brahman</i>. Then to that <i>tīrtha</i> where <i>Brahmán (Lokapitāmahaḥ</i>) had created the worlds; where the great Ṛ. <i>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa</i> had acquired brahman— hood; where the Ṛ.-ṛ. <i>Sindhudvīpa</i>, the great ascetic <i>Devāpi</i> (both in the <i>Kṛta</i> age, IX, <b>40</b>, 2294), and the <i>muni Viśvā-</i> <i>mitra</i> had obtained brahmanhood (IX, <b>39</b>). Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the history of <i>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa</i> (<i>m</i>) and of <i>Viśvāmitra (n</i>). Thence to the abode of <i>Baka</i>, where <i>Dālbhya Baka</i> had practised austerities (IX, <b>40</b>); which resounded with the chanting of the <i>Vedas (brahma-</i> <i>ghoṣair avākīrṇaṃ</i>; B. has <i>Brahmayoner Avākīrṇaṃ</i> “from Br. to Av.,” Nīl.), where the Ṛ. <i>Baka Dālbhya (o</i>) poured the kingdom of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīryi</i> (?<i>Vaicitravīryiṇaḥ</i>, genitive) as a libation into the sacrificial fire. In that <i>tīrtha</i> <i>Bṛhaspati</i> also poured libations into the sacrificial fire, by means of flesh, in order to destroy the <i>Asuras</i>, and the As. began to waste away and were destroyed by the gods. Thence to <i>Yāyāta tīrtha</i>, where, at a sacrifice of king <i>Yayāti</i> <i>Nāhuṣa</i>, the <i>Sarasvatī</i> produced milk and clarified butter, whereafter <i>Yayāti</i> went to heaven. Once again <i>Yayāti</i> performed a sacrifice there, and <i>Sarasvatī</i> gave to each of the brahmans everything for which he cherished a wish; they regarded the gifts as made to them by the king, and praised and blessed him; D. and G. were pleased. Thence <i>Baladeva</i> proceeded to the <i>tīrtha Vasiṣṭhāpavāha</i> (IX, <b>41</b>). Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> told the history of <i>Vasiṣṭhāpavāha (p</i>), and why it is so rapid, and the brahmanicide of <i>Indra (s</i>), who was purified by bathing in that <i>tīrtha</i>. Thence <i>Baladeva</i> went to the <i>tīrtha</i> of <i>Soma</i>; where in days of yore <i>Soma</i> had performed the <i>Rājasūyā</i> sacrifice, with <i>Atri</i> for his <i>hotṛ</i>, after which the great battle took place between D. and Dā., Dai., and a Rā., named <i>Tāraka</i>, in which <i>Skanda (Mahāsena</i>) slew <i>Tāraka</i> and obtained the command of the celestial forces; in that <i>tīrtha</i> is a gigantic <i>Aśvattha</i> tree, under whose shade <i>Kārttikeya</i> (<i>Skanda</i>) always resides in person (IX, <b>43</b>). Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the investiture of <i>Skanda (u</i>). The <i>tīrtha</i>, where in days of yore <i>Varuṇa</i>, the lord of the waters, had been installed by the celestials, is named <i>Taijasa</i>. Having bathed in that <i>tīrtha</i> and adored <i>Skanda, Bala-Rāma</i> gave gold, etc., to the <i>brahmans</i>; passing one night there, he became cheerful and happy (IX, <b>44—46</b>). Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the installation of <i>Varuṇa (v</i>) in a former <i>kalpa</i>. Thence <i>Baladeva</i> (“the slayer of <i>Pralamba</i>”) proceeded to <i>Agnitīrtha</i>, where <i>Agni</i>, disappearing, became concealed in the <i>Śamī</i> wood, wherefore the gods repaired to <i>Brahmán</i>, and asked him to create fire. Requested by <i>Janamejaya</i>, <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> related the story of <i>Agnitīrtha (w</i>). Thence he went to <i>Brahmayoni</i>, where <i>Brahmán</i> had exercised his functions of creation; in days of yore <i>Brahmán</i>, having bathed in that <i>tīrtha</i> with all the gods, created all the <i>tīrthas</i> for the gods, according to due rites. Thence to <i>Kaubera</i> <i>tīrtha</i>, where <i>Ailavila</i>. (i.e. <i>Kubera</i>) (<i>x</i>), having practised austerities, obtained the mastery of all treasures (<i>Dhanādhi-</i> <i>patyaṃ</i>), and all kinds of wealth, etc., came to him of their own accord. <i>Rāma</i> there beheld the excellent woods of <i>Kubera</i>. Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> went to <i>Badarapācana</i>, where the fruits of every season are always to be found (IX, <b>47</b>), and where many ascetics and Si. are dwelling. (The story of <i>Badarapācana (y</i>) and of <i>Arundhatī (z</i>).) Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the birth of <i>Śrutāvatī (aa</i>). Then <i>Baladeva</i> proceeded to <i>Indratīrtha</i> (IX, <b>48</b>). (The history of <i>Indratīrtha (bb</i>).) Thence to <i>Rāmatīrtha (cc</i>), the resort of D. and B.-ṛ. Thence to <i>Yamunātīrtha (dd</i>). Thence <i>Baladeva</i>, adorned with garlands of wild flowers (<i>vanamālī</i>), proceeded to <i>Ādityatīrtha (ee</i>), where also Ṛ. <i>Asita Devala</i> obtained great <i>yoga</i> powers (IX, <b>49</b>). (The history of <i>Asita Devala (ff</i>).) Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> went to the <i>tīrtha</i> of <i>Soma</i> (IX, <b>50</b>), where <i>Soma</i> had in former days performed the <i>Rājasūya</i> sacrifice, and where the great battle was fought about <i>Tārā (Tārakāmayaḥ</i>). Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> proceeded to the <i>tīrtha</i> of the <i>muni Sārasvata</i>, where, during a drought of twelve years, <i>Sārasvata</i> in former days taught the <i>Vedas</i> to many <i>brahmans</i>. Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related the history of <i>Sārasvata (gg</i>) and of <i>Dadhīca (hh</i>). Thence <i>Bala-Rāma</i> proceeded to the <i>tīrtha</i> of the old maiden (<i>vṛddhakanyā</i>) (IX, <b>51</b>). Requested by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśam-</i> <i>pāyana</i> related the story of the <i>vṛddhakanyā (ii</i>). While there, <i>Baladeva</i> heard of the slaughter of <i>Śalya</i>. Having come out of the environs of <i>Samantapancaka (Samantapañcakadvārāt</i>), he enquired of the Ṛ. what was the result of a visit to <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, which they told him (IX, <b>52</b>). (<i>Kurukṣetra-</i> <i>kathana (kk</i>) (IX, <b>53</b>).) Having visited <i>Kurukṣetra, Bala—</i> <i>Rāma</i> proceeded to a large and exceedingly beautiful hermitage, overgrown with <i>madhūkas</i>, etc., and was told by Ṛ.: Here <i>Viṣṇu</i> in days of yore undertook austere penances and performed duly all the eternal sacrifices. Here a <i>brāhmaṇī</i> girl, having from youth observed the vow of <i>brahmacarya</i>, was crowned with success (<i>siddhā</i>), and, in possession of <i>yoga</i> powers, she proceeded to heaven. The beautiful daughter of <i>Śāṇḍilya</i>, a <i>brahmacāriṇī</i>, who had performed penances difficult to women, went to heaven [here], and was worshipped by the gods and <i>brahmans. Baladeva</i> then began his ascent of <i>Himavat</i>, and soon came to the <i>tīrtha Plakṣaprasravaṇa</i>, and thence to the <i>tīrtha Kārapavana</i> (PCR. <i>°vapa°</i>), where he passed one night. > the asylum of <i>Mitra</i> and <i>Varuṇa</i>. From <i>Kāra-</i> <i>pavana</i> > that spot on the <i>Yamunā</i> where in days of yore <i>Indra</i>, <i>Agni</i>, and <i>Aryaman</i> had obtained great happiness. Then he sat down with Ṛ. and Si. in order to listen to their talk. There came Ṛ. <i>Nārada (ll</i>), and, asked by <i>Bala-Rāma</i>, he told him all that had happened to the <i>Kurus</i>, including the names of those chiefs that had fallen (ν), and of those that were still alive (ζ), and asked him to go to the field to witness the mace-encounter between <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i>, which was to take place that very day. <i>Bala-Rāma</i> then bade farewell, and dismissed all those that had accompanied him to <i>Dvārakā</i>, and descended from <i>Himavat</i> and <i>Plakṣaprasravaṇa</i>, and sang a verse in praise of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>. Then he ascended a chariot with goodly steeds, and arrived on the field (IX, <b>54</b>)."
