The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The title <i>‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh)</i> has frequently been used by the Sassanian kings.<sup>417</sup> The contemporary Sassanian emperor was Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).<sup>418</sup> The Sassanians are known to have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.<sup>419</sup> According to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan. His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was the starting point for a new era (A.D. 208).<sup>420</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Goyal<sup>421</sup> confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.<sup>422</sup> The Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.<sup>423</sup> Though the possibility of a Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that at the time of Samudragupta,<sup>424</sup> three kings the Daivaputra (the Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa), and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling independently.<sup>425</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Buddha Prakash<sup>426</sup> traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of the early medieval period.<sup>427</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or receiving some person respectively."
