The extent to which the special Buddhist sense is present in the verb is often doubtful; I list a few cases where it seems pretty clear: abhijānāmi <ls>SP</ls> 〔200.8〕 (<ls>Burnouf</ls> and <ls>Kern</ls>, <i>remember</i>, I think wrongly); <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.57.7, 12〕; <ls>Gv</ls> 〔446.14〕; <ls>Vaj</ls> 〔34.20〕. The translation <i>remember</i>, also given <ls>CPD</ls>, is due to the fact that events of the past are often referred to; but I think the Buddha (the usual subject in such cases) <i>knows</i> them by <i>supernatural knowledge</i> or so-called <i>intuition</i> (<b>abhijñā</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab>), not by <i>memory</i>; (<b>2</b>) <i>recognizes</i> (as a duty), <i>takes upon oneself</i> (a vow or undertaking); so also in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>MN</ls> 〔i.80.5〕 (definitions in <lang>Pali</lang> dictionaries including <ls>CPD</ls> hardly do justice to this <ab>mg.</ab>): <ls>LV</ls> 〔254.2〕 abhijānāmy ahaṃ … ekam evādvitīyaṃ kolam āhāram āhartum, <i>I undertake to allow myself to eat only a single kola as food</i>; similarly <ls>LV</ls> 〔255.8, 15〕."
