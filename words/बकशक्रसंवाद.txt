Mārkaṇḍeya</i> related: After the conflict between the gods and <i>asuras</i> was over, and <i>Indra</i> had become the ruler of the three worlds, all people were happy and virtuous. Once <i>Indra</i>, riding on <i>Airāvata</i>, surveyed his happy subjects, and, descending to earth, he made a visit to the <i>ṛṣi Baka</i>, who had lived for 100,000 years and was adored by gods and <i>ṛṣis</i> (<i>?devarṣigaṇasevita</i>, v. 13236; PCR. has the accus.), in his hermitage in the east by the seaside. <i>Indra</i> asked him about the sorrows of those who have a long life. <i>Baka</i> mentioned several common disagreeable things, and finally, the having to witness the injustices that take place. <i>Indra</i> then asked him about their joys; he mentioned the frugal life of a pious <i>brahman</i>, who only eats after having waited on his guest."
