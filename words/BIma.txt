Bhīmasena, one of the five Pāṇḍavas. <F>1) Since much information about Bhīma is given under the captions Dharmaputra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Pāñcālī only a brief description of Bhīma is attempted under the present heading.</F> <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Genealogy.</i> (See genealogy of Arjuna). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Birth and childhood.</i> King Vicitravīrya of Candra vaṃśa (lunar dynasty) had two sons called Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. The Kauravas (Duryodhana etc.) were sons born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra of his wife Gāndhārī, and the Pāṇḍavas were the sons of Pāṇḍu and his wives Kuntī and Mādrī. Dharmaputra, Bhīma and Arjuna were the sons of Kuntī, and Nakula and Sahadeva of Mādrī. <F>1) The Pāṇḍavas were not in fact direct issues of Pāṇḍu. For details see Kuntī.</F> <dvsn n='NI'/>Kuntī directed a mantra gifted to her by Durvāsas towards Vāyubhagavān (the wind-god) and the result was the birth of Bhīma. Hence he is called Vāyu-putra (son of the wind-god). At the time of his birth a celestial voice announced that the boy would grow up to be the strongest among the strong. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 14). On the tenth day after birth the child Bhīma fell from his mother's lap on a rock. Bhīma was not injured in any manner by that fall, although it crushed the rock into power. (This story is told in the southern texts of the Mahābhārata in Chapter 132 of Ādi Parva). The naming ceremony of the child was performed by the Maharṣis, who stayed at Śataśṛṅga. Kaśyapa Maharṣi, family priest of Vasudeva performed the ceremonies like wearing of the sacred thread. Bhīma learned fighting with the gadā (club or mace) from Śuka, the famous Rājarṣi. <dvsn n='NI'/>The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas spent their childhood in Hastināpura. Droṇācārya taught them fighting with weapons. The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas often engaged themselves in children's games. In all such games Bhīma used to hurt and defeat the Kauravas, and to this fact the unending hatred of the Kauravas towards Bhīma owed its origin. Once they administered poison to Bhīma who fell down unconscious, and then they threw him into the depths of the Gaṅgā (Ganges). Going deeper and deeper in the waters Bhīma, at last, reached the Nāgaloka, where the nāgas (serpents) bit him which neutralized the effects of the poison in his body. There he got acquainted with a nāga called Āryaka, who introduced him to Vāsuki, king of the nāgas, and Vāsuki presented him with much wealth and other costly gems. But, what use was all this wealth to Bhīma? Then Vāsuki agreed to give him a divine drink, which would give the user of it the strength of thousand elephants. Bhīma drank at one draught eight pot-fulls of that divine drink, and thus became tremendously strong. But, he had to wait in Nāgaloka for eight days so that the drink might be thoroughly assimilated, and on the ninth day the nāgas saw him off in all pomp and splendour. Bhīma returned to his mother and brothers and consoled them, who were terribly anxious at his absence. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the training of the princes in the use of weapons was over a competition or test was conducted. Duryodhana and Bhīma entered into a ‘club-fight’, and when Karṇa tried to intervene in the fight his nobility was questioned by Bhīma. Duryodhana then insulted Bhīma. Arjuna agreed to present King Drupada before Droṇācārya as gurudakṣinā to him. In the fierce war the Pāṇḍavas fought with Drupada, Bhīma annihilated the elephant division of the latter's army. And, afterwards Bhīma underwent higher training in club-war at the hands of Balabhadrarāma. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 136, Verse 4). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>The Pāṇḍavas left Hastināpura.</i> As enmity between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas began growing stronger and stronger, Duryodhana, with his father's permission, removed the Pāṇḍavas to vāraṇāvata and settled them there. They were put up there in a palace specially made of lac. The Pāṇḍavas divined the secret of it and escaped from the fire, when the palace was set fire to. Verse 10, Chapter 147 of the Ādi Parva states that it was Bhīma, who set fire to the palace. Escaping thus through a tunnel the Pāṇḍavas travelled a great distance in the forest. Kuntī and four of her sons got tired by the exertions of the travel and were forced to sit down for rest on the way. Bhīma, continued the journey carrying the mother and his four brothers on his shoulders. With their entry into Hiḍiṃba forest the weakness left them, and they became their former selves. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Hiḍiṃba killed.</i> Kuntī devī and four sons slept under the shade of a tree at dusk, and Bhīma kept guard over them. There dwelt in the forest a Rākṣasa called Hiḍiṃba with his sister, Hiḍiṃbī. Hiḍiṃba looked around that particular day from the top of a tree, and detecting Bhīma his mouth watered. He deputed Hiḍimbī to bring Bhīma over to him. Hiḍiṃbī approached Bhīma, whose fine figure kindled feelings of love in her. She desired to have him as husband. Hiḍiṃbī having not returned even after a long time Hidiṃba went over to the spot, and there finding Hiḍiṃbī in love-talks with Bhīma he got terribly angry. He wanted to kill Hiḍiṃbī. Bhīma, who could not suffer the killing of a woman in his presence rushed against Hiḍiṃba, The noise of the fight awakened the other Pāṇḍavas from sleep, and at the instance of Arjuna, Bhīma killed Hiḍiṃba. Thus rendered helpless and forlorn Hiḍiṃbī again craved Bhīma for love. On the suggestion of Kuntī, whose heart melted at the sight of Hiḍiṃbī's helplessness Bhīma took her as his wife. But, one condition was stipulated for their enjoying the honey-moon. The condition was that they might enjoy honey-moon, from dawn to dusk in the sky and on mountain tops, Hiḍiṃbī, who was endowed with magic powers carrying Bhīma with her. And, after dusk Bhīma was to be returned to Kuntī. Accordingly Bhīma and Hiḍiṃbī spent one year, and to them was born a son called Ghaṭotkaca. Promising that he shall return when wanted, Ghaṭotkaca with his mother went into the forest. The Pāṇḍavas also left for the village called Ekacakrā. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 147-154). <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Killing of Baka and the wedding of Pāñcālī.</i> While at Ekacakrā Bhīma killed the Rākṣasa called Baka and freed the people of the village from their distress. Afterwards the Pāṇḍavas attended the Svayamvara (free choice of the husband by woman) of Pāñcālī, who became their wife. There Bhīma defeated Śalya in fight. And, the Pāṇḍavas duly returned to Hastināpura. (For details see Baka, Pāñcālī and Arjuna). <dvsn n='NI'/>6) <i>Again to forest.</i> On their return to Hastinapura the Pāṇḍavas took their residence in the palace built by Maya. There Maya presented a magnificent club to Bhīma. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 18). It was Śrī Kṛṣṇa, lord of Dvārakā who served as the right hand of the Pāṇḍavas. Jarāsandha, who was then King of Magadha fought with Kṛṣṇa eighteen times and got defeated. Yet he did not yield, and at last Kṛṣṇa decided to do away with him. Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna and Bhīma, in disguise, set out for Magadha. They entered Jarāsandha's palace and challenged him to a duel. Bhīma and Jarāsandha clashed, and at the instance of Kṛṣṇa Bhīma rent the latter in two and threw him on the ground. Though Jarāsandha was alive again, Bhīma rent him in two and threw away the two parts to two places. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Southern Text, Chapter 24). <dvsn n='NI'/>The main impediments and thorns in their way thus having been removed, Dharmaputra decided to perform Rājasūya. Bhīma was deputed to conquer all the kingdoms in the eastern part of India. Bhīma achieved the object and returned with great wealth to Indraprastha. Though Bhīma got ready to kill Śiśupāla, who alone refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Yudhiṣṭhira, he also yielded on the tactful advice of Bhīṣma. The Rājasūya Yajña went off quite successfully. It was Bhīma, who, after the Yajña was over, took Bhīṣma and Yudhiṣṭhira to Hastināpura. Afterwards, in the contest in the game of dice played between Dharmaputra and Duryodhana, the Pāṇḍavas lost everything. The Kauravas brought Pāñcālī into the assembly hall and attempted to strip her naked in public. Bhīma who got enraged at this shouted that the hands of Yudhiṣṭhira who played dice should be burnt in fire. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 6). And, Bhīma took then and there the terrible pledge that he would, with his hands stained by blood from the chest of Duśśāsana, who tried to rip Pāñcālī naked, tie up Pāñcālī's hair which got untied in the scuffle. He also swore that he would break the thigh of Duryodhana. In uncontrollable rage Bhīma also shouted that he would turn into ashes all those who took part in the game of dice. Bhīma took also the vow that all the Kauravas would be killed. <dvsn n='NI'/>According to the terms and conditions laid down with regard to the contest in the game of dice the Pāṇḍavas went into the Kāmyaka forest to live there for twelve years and then to live incognito for one year. <dvsn n='NI'/>7) <i>Life in forest and life incognito.</i> There lived in Kāmyaka forest a Rākṣasa called Kirmīra, brother of Bala, whom Bhīma had killed on an earlier occasion. Kirmīra, who was awaiting an opportunity to avenge the murder of his brother, now clashed with Bhīma in the forest. Bhīma did very easily kill him. (For details see Kirmīra). <dvsn n='NI'/>Thus the Pāṇḍavas spent their days once again in the Kāmyaka forest under the spiritual leadership of sage Dhaumya. They thought about their lost kingdom. Should they go to war against the Kauravas or should they spend the rest of their lives in the exercise of dhārmic injunctions? At one time Bhīma advised Yudhiṣṭhira against war; but on another occasion he pleaded vehemently in favour of war. It was during this time that Arjuna went to the Himālayas to please Śiva by penance and get from him the Pāśupatāstra. (Arrow called Pāśupata). The Pāṇḍavas naturally got nervous and upset at the rather long absence of Arjuna; Bhīma was more anxious and sorry than the others. Then the Pāṇḍavas set out in search of Arjuna, and travelled upto Mount Gandhamādana. Then the party got so tired that they could not proceed any further. Pāñcālī fell down fainting. Then Bhīma remembered Ghaṭotkaca, who appeared before his father (Bhīma) at once. As directed by Bhīma Ghaṭotkaca mounted the Pāṇdavas on his shoulders and the journey continued. They reached the Āśrama of Naranārāyaṇas, and rested there for six days. One day the wind blowing from the northeast dropped near Pāñcālī a Saugandhika flower. And, Bhīma set out in the north-east direction to fetch saugandhika flowers for Pāñcālī, who felt a special liking for them. <dvsn n='NI'/>Walking and walking Bhīma entered Kadalīvana. Hanūmān, his skin wrinkled and hair grey due to old age, was living in this forest. He obstructed the path of Bhīma. Hanūmān awoke from sleep and raised his tail with a terrific sound. Bhīma walked upto the place whence the sound was heard. <F>1. When raised, Hanūmān's tail was as high in the sky as the flag of Indra, and produced a thunderous sound. As though the mountains were vomitting through their mouth, the sound produced by the raising of the tail shook the mountains. Drowning the trumpeting of excited elephants the sound reverberated all around the mountains. Hearing the sound Bhīma, his whole body horripilated entered the forest in the direction of the sound. In the middle of Kadalīvana, on a mighty rock, Bhīma saw Hanūmān.</F> (Vanaparva, Chapter 146). In the clash that ensued between Hanūmān and Bhīma the former came out victorious. Hanūmān, however, congratulated Bhīma and directed him on the path to the saugandhika forest. <dvsn n='NI'/>Bhīmasena reached the saugandhika forest, which was being guarded by the Rākṣasas called Krodhavaśas. Bhīma overcame them, collected the flowers and returning with them stayed in the Badarikāśrama with his brothers and Pāñcālī. Here it was that Bhīma killed Jaṭāsura. (For details see Jaṭāsura II). <dvsn n='NI'/>Four years were thus spent; yet Arjuna had not returned. The Pāṇḍavas continued their journey northward. On the 17th day they came to the Āśrama of Vṛṣaparvā in the Himālayas. They were duly received by the maharṣi, who directed them in their onward journey. Continuing the journey they reached the Āśrama of Ārṣṭiṣeṇa whence, after crossing various mountain peaks and still walking they reached Kubera's Alakāpurī when a Yakṣa called Maṇimān obstructed their further progress. Bhīma killed Maṇimān and the other Yakṣas who rushed to his support. Finally Kubera himself saw Bhīma and blessed the Pāṇḍavas. <dvsn n='NI'/>While they were returning from Kubera's palace Bhīma was caught by a python. But, it was really Nahuṣa transformed into a python on account of a curse. Bhīma killed it and it assumed its original form as Nahuṣa. (See Agastya, Para 8). By this time Arjuna had obtained Pāśupatāstra from Śiva and he duly returned to his brothers, and the Pāṇḍavas continued their journey in the forest. <dvsn n='NI'/>Meantime, knowing that the Pāṇḍavas were put up in Dvaitavana, the Kauravas started for their dwelling place in a procession led by Duryodhana with the army and camped nearly two furlongs away from a pool in Dvaitavana. While thus camping Duryodhana clashed with a Gandharva called Citrasena, who with a number of his comrades came to the pool for water games, and in the encounter the latter made Duryodhana prisoner. Bhīmasena who witnessed the scene very much laughed at Duryodhana. But, Arjuna intervened and set free Duryodhana and others. <dvsn n='NI'/>The Pāṇḍavas again entered the Kāmyaka forest, and it was at that time that Jayadratha abducted Pāñcālī. Bhīma killed Koṭikāsya who acted on behalf of Jayadratha. (See Koṭikāsya). Moreover Bhīma captured Jayadratha, got his head shaved clean and declared that he was a slave of Dharmaputra. It was here at Dvaitavana that Dharmadeva tested the Pāṇḍavas, who had gone to a nearby pool to fetch water; all the Pāṇḍavas except Yudhiṣṭhira died at the pool, but were brought back to life again. (See Dharmaputra, Para 7). The twelve years’ forest-life of the Pāṇḍavas now came to an end. <dvsn n='NI'/>According to the advice of Dharmadeva the Pāṇḍavas selected the Virāṭa palace for their life incognito, Bhīmasena assuming the name Vallava (Valala). And, here Bhīma killed in a duel Jīmūta, the pugilist. (See Jīmūta II). It was also here that Bhīma killed Kīcaka and the Upakīcakas. (See Kīcaka). On another occasion, at the instance of Yudhiṣṭhira Bhīma took Sudharmā, King of Daśārṇa to Yudhiṣṭhira captive; but he was later set free. Next year the Pāṇḍavas defeated Duryodhana in the fight in connection with the theft of the cows of the Virāṭa King, and then they declared that their forest life and life incognito were over. <dvsn n='NI'/>8) <i>Bhīma in the great war.</i> Even after the return of the Pāṇḍavas after the forest life and life incognito the Kauravas refused to give them half of the kingdom. So, both the parties began preparations for war. Given hereunder is the main incident relating to Bhīma from this period to the Svargārohaṇa (going to Heaven) of the Pāṇḍavas after relinquishing the kingdom in favour of Parīkṣit, including their victory in war and the administration of the country. <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) Sañjaya described to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the prowess and achievements of Bhīma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 50). <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) Śrī Kṛṣṇa before leaving for the Kaurava assembly for compromise talks asked for the views of Bhīma about the whole problem, and Bhīma opined that peace was preferable to war. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74). <dvsn n='NI'/>(3) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa admonished Bhīma he opted for war and waxed eloquent about his heroism and prowess. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 76). <dvsn n='NI'/>(4) Bhīma wanted Śikhaṇḍī to be appointed chief of the army. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 161). <dvsn n='NI'/>(5) Bhīma sent back with an insulting reply Ulūka, who was sent by Duryodhana to the Pāṇḍavas with a message. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 163). <dvsn n='NI'/>(6) Bhīma questioned Dharmaputra who, when the armies had taken position on opposite sides, went on foot to the Kaurava assembly without bow and arrows.

But, Bhīma, in all haughtiness claimed the credit for victory to his personal prowess. With the object of putting down this conceit on the part of Bhīma, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, with Bhīma seated along with him on Garuḍa, set out on a journey to the south. After crossing the sea and Mount Subela Śrī Kṛṣṇa, pointing out to Bhīma a lake twelve yojanas wide and lying near Laṅkā, asked him to find out the source of the lake and return with the information. Though Bhīma walked some distance he could not find out its source. Not only that, all the warriors there jointly attacked Bhīma, and finding himself impotent to counter the attack he ran back to Śrī Kṛṣṇa for refuge. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa with his ring clipped and threw away the lake, and said to Bhīma as follows:—“This is the skull of Kumbhakarṇa killed by Śrī Rāma in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. The warriors who attacked you are the asuras called ‘Sarogeyas’.” These words of the lord put down Bhīma's conceit, and he apologised to Kṛṣṇa. (Skanda Purāṇa, 1.2.66). <dvsn n='NI'/>9) <i>Death.</i> After entrusting matters of administration of the country to Parīkṣit the Pāṇḍavas set out on their great journey. Yudhiṣṭhira walking in the front, they started for Kailāsa. During the course of their journey Pāñcālī, Sahadeva, Nakula and Arjuna one after the other fell down dead. Bhīma asked Yudhiṣṭhira the reason for the deaths and he was given suitable answers by the latter. At last when Bhīma too was about to fall down and die he asked the reason thereof, and Yudhiṣṭhira replied that Bhīma's over-eating was the reason. Afterwards when Dharmaputra entered Heaven he found his brothers had already their seats there. (See Arjuna, Para 31). <dvsn n='NI'/>10) <i>Other information.</i> (1) Bhīma had a son named Sutasoma by Pāñcālī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 75). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) A son called Sarvaga was born to Bhīma of Balandharā, daughter of the King of Kāśī.

The following story about him occurs on page 619 of the Padmapurāṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>In the dvāpara yuga there lived a Śūdra called Bhīma, who engaged himself in the profession of Vaiśyas. An outcaste from practices pertaining to Śūdras he enjoyed life with a Vaiśya woman. He was a terrible fellow, who had killed many brahmins, and also enjoyed the wives of many elderly people including his teachers. He was a robber as well. Once he went to a brahmin house, and with the object of robbing his wealth spoke to him in a pathetic tone as follows:—“Respected sire, you will please listen to my grievance. You appear to be kindhearted. Please give me some rice, or else I will die this very moment.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Brahmin:—“Oh hungry guest! There is no one here to cook food. I shall give you daily some rice, which you may cook yourself. I have neither father, mother, son, brothers, wife nor any other relatives. All of them are dead and gone. The unfortunate fellow that I am, I am staying here alone. No servants or others here.” Bhīma:—“Oh revered brahmin! I too am a lonely person. I shall live here for ever serving you. I am a Śūdra.” <dvsn n='NI'/>These words of Bhīma pleased the brahmin so much that he cooked some food quickly and served the Śūdra with it. He stayed with the brahmin from that day onwards. His idea was to rob the brahmin of his wealth at some convenient time and get away. But, since he used to pour on his head everyday the water with which the brahmin's feet were washed he got redemption from all his sins. <dvsn n='NI'/>One night a thief got into the brahmin's room to steal his earnings. Seeing the thief Bhīma rushed at him to give him a good thrashing. But, the thief, in the twinkling of an eye, cut off Bhīma's head and escaped from the scene. At once there came down the attendants of Lord Viṣṇu to lead Bhīma to Vaikuṇṭha. A divine chariot drawn by Rājahaṃsas (swans) also came down. Bhīma got into the chariot and reached the abode of Viṣṇu."
