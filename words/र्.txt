            "content": "(1) second letter of the यण् class (semi-vowels) which has got the properties नादभागित्व, घोषवत्त्व,' संवृतत्व and अल्पप्राणता i. e. it is a sonant, inaspirate consonant Regarding its स्थान or place of production, there is a difference of opinion : generally the consonant र् is looked upon as a cerebral or lingual letter (मूर्धन्य); cf ऋटुरषाणां मूर्धा， S.K.also Pan. Siksa; but it is called by some as दन्त्य or दन्तमूलीयः cf रेफस्तु दस्त्ये दन्तमूले वा RT. 8, by others as दन्तमूलीय and and by still others as वर्स्त्य gingival. In the Vajasaneyi-Pratisakhya it is described as दन्तमूलीयः cf रो दन्तमूल I. 68, while in the Taittiriya Pratisakhya it is said to be produced by the touch of the middle part of the tip of the tongue just above the root of the teeth;cf. रेफे जिह्वाग्रमध्येन प्रत्यग्दन्तमूलेभ्यः T. Pr. II. 41; (2) substitute र् (रेफ) for the final letter of the word अहन्, as also for the final of अम्रस्, ऊधस्, अवस् and भुवस् optionally with रु, which (रु) is dropped before vowels, and changed to ओ before अ and soft consonants, while it is changed into visarga before hard consonants and surds.e.g. अम्नरेव, अम्र एवः ऊधरेव, ऊधएवः cf. Kas. on P. VIII, 2-70: (3) the constant र् (technically) called र् in  Panini's grammar) which is substituted for the consonant स् and for the consonant न् of the word अहन् when the consonant स् or न् stands at the end of a word. This substitute रु, unlike the substitute र् is liable to be changed into visarga, or the consonant य्, or the vowel उ by P. VIII.3.15, 17, VI.1.113, 114."
