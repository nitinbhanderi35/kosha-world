It is situated on the northern side of the ocean of milk. It is 32,000 miles above Meru mountain. The inhabitants of Śvetadvīpa are without the sense organs. They do not take food They are rich in “Jñāna” (knowledge). Their bodies give out perpetual fragrance. These sinless people are of white complexion. Their bodies and bones are as hard as Vajrāyudha. Their heads are as broad and flat as umbrellas and their voice as loud as thunder. Each of them has four arms and sixty teeth. All of them worship Śiva. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Chapter 335)."
