very common is <i>bless</i>, which I think should be deleted, see below): (<b>1</b>) <i>masters, controls</i>, in normal <lang>Skt.</lang> (<ls>BR</ls> sthā with adhi 3, 4) and also <lang>BHS</lang> (<ab>exx.</ab> <ls>LaVallée Poussin, AbhidhK.</ls> 〔vii.119 note 2, b〕);

but the nun is the only speaker; she would not ‘bless’ her own belongings!); in <lang>BHS</lang> (<b>2</b>) the power or control is usually <i>supernatural</i> or <i>magical</i>: adhitiṣṭhantu buddhā bhagavanto idaṃ paṭasūtram <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔56.12〕, <i>let the Lord Buddhas exercize their supernatural power over</i> (assume control of) <i>this thread</i> (<ls>Lalou, Iconographie</ls> 〔p. 20〕, <i><fr>occupent</fr></i>); in the sequel, favorable sounds show the performer that, adhiṣṭhitaṃ me buddhair … tat paṭasūtraṃ (17); he reflects, buddhānāṃ … adhiṣṭhānam etat (24), <i>this is the controlling power of the <ab>B.</ab></i>;

the meaning <i>bless</i>, assumed by <ls>Burnouf</ls> and many others, rests on <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>byin kyi rlabs</tib>, which to be sure often means <i>bless</i>, but <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Jäschke</ls> also <i>create, change into</i>;
