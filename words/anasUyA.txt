(Bhāgavata, Skandha 1, Chapter 4). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>The Tapaśśakti of Anasūyā.</i> Once upon a time, rains having failed for ten years the whole world sweated in agony and river Gaṅgā got dried up. Famine stalked the world. In this dire contingency it was the tapaśśakti of Anasūyā that made trees bear fruits and Gaṅgā to flow again. Also, she converted ten days into nights on the request of the Devas. <dvsn n='NI'/>During their forest life Rāma and Sītā reached the hermitage of sage Atri, and the sage and Anasūyā treated the guests sumptuously. The above story about the tapaśśakti of Anasūyā was told then by Atri. The story helped to increase Rāma's respect for Anasūyā. Anasūyā gave Sītā all proper advice. She taught Sītā that absolute service to husband is the greatest tapas ordained to women. Anasūyā gave to Sītā a very sacred garland and a sublime gem. And, after that Rāma and Sītā left the hermitage. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyākāṇḍa, Cantos 117 and 118.). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Sons of Anasūyā.</i> She had three sons: Dattātreya, Durvāsas and Candra. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 10). (The reason for Mahāviṣṇu being born as Dattātreya, Śiva as Durvāsas and Brahmā as Candra to Anasūyā is given under Atri)."
