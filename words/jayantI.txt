            "content": "JAYANTĪ II¦. Daughter of Indra and sister of Jayanta. In Bhāgavata, Skandha 4, there is a story stating how Jayantī was the wife of Śukra for ten years. <dvsn n='NI'/>Śukrācārya was the teacher-priest of the Asuras (demons). Once the devas (gods) had completely defeated the Asuras. With the intention of procuring new powers from Śrī Parameśvara, Śukrācārya went to Kailāsa. When the penance of Śukra became more and more severe the gods and Indra began to be flurried. Indra told his daughter Jayantī to become the servant of Śukra and to break his penance somehow or other. Jayantī did not like this procedure of her father. Still she did not like to disobey her father. So she went to Kailāsa and became the attendant of Śukra and stayed with him. She served him dutifully and with chastity. She would fan him with plantain leaf. She would prepare cold and fragrant water for him to drink. When the Sun became hotter she would hold her upper garment as an umbrella so that he should be in the shade. She would gather fully ripened good fruits for him to eat. She would gather good variety of darbha grass, cut them into the length of a span and with good flowers she would give them to the hermit for his morning oblations. She would gather soft sprouts and make bed for him and would stand near him fanning till he slept. She would get water ready for him to rinse his mouth when he woke up. Thus she did the work of a dutiful disciple. She did not, in any way by speech or action, try to entice him so that his vow of penance might be broken. She spoke only words which would be pleasing and helpful to him. This continued for thousand years and then Paramaśiva appeared before him and gave the boons he requested for. After that Śukrācārya talked with her. In accordance with her request the hermit Śukra allowed her to live with him for ten years as his wife. He gave her a boon that during that period of ten years they both would be invisible to the world. Thus Śukrācārya married Jayantī and they lived in the house very happily for ten years."
