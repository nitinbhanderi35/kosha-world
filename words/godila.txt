            "content": "GODILA II¦. A servant of Vaiśravaṇa. Once when Godila was travelling by air he saw Padmāvatī, wife of Ugrasena, King of Vidarbha, bathing in a pond along with her companions. The very sight of the enchanting Padmāvatī roused carnal passions in him and the Yakṣa took the form of Ugrasena and started singing from the top of a hillock nearby. Padmāvatī went to him because she mistook him for her husband. Embracing her passionately the Yakṣa outraged her modesty. Subtle differences in the act created doubts in Padmāvatī and, on being questioned, the Yakṣa told the truth and left the place. (Chapter 49, Padma Purāṇa)."
