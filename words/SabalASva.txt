To procreate man-kind Dakṣa first created five hundred sons by his wife Asiknī and named them Haryaśvas. Dakṣa had to create the Śabalāśvas as the Haryaśvas were misled by Nārada. But, Nārada approached and told the Śabalāśvas also that it was not correct on their part to procreate children before they had studied the interior, exterior, bottom and top of the earth. Believing Nārada's advice the Śabalāśvas also set out to measure the extent of the earth and they have not yet returned. Because of this Brahmā cursed that Nārada, instead of living at one place, should always be on the move. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 15)."
