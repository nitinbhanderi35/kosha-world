The news had been reported to all the monarchs that <i>Draupadī</i> had been married to the sons of <i>Pāṇḍu</i>, whom they had thought burnt to death. They then set out for their own dominions. <i>Duryodhana</i> became greatly depressed, and, with his brothers, etc., he set out for <i>Hāstinapura. Vidura</i> was filled with joy, and related the news to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, who first thought that it was <i>Duryodhana</i> who had been selected by <i>Draupadī</i>, but was very glad on hearing that it was the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. But <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> tried to stir him up against them (I, <b>200</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> said that he was of their opinion, but did not wish to inform <i>Vidura</i> of it; therefore he had applauded the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in <i>Vidura's</i> presence. <i>Duryodhana</i> suggested several plans for getting the better of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (I, <b>201</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> said that the plans would not succeed; he recommended to vanquish them by prowess, while their party was yet weak. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> summoned <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Vidura</i>, and consulted with them (I, <b>202</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> recommended to give to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> one half of the kingdom (I, <b>203</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> approved of this, and, moreover, recommended that a messenger should be sent to <i>Drupada</i> with gifts, and say that <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was very glad of the new alliance with him, and would take the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to <i>Hāstinapura</i> to be installed on the throne.—§ 242. <i>Karṇa</i> spoke contemptuously of <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, saying that happiness depended on destiny, and not on friends, etc., mentioning the <i>Magadha</i> king <i>Ambuvīca (b</i>) (I, <b>204</b>).—§ 243. <i>Vidura</i> recommended the suggestion of <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, and said that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were invincible, as they were assisted by <i>Rāma, Janārdana, Sātyaki</i>, etc. (I, <b>205</b>). <i>Vidura</i> was sent by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> with numerous jewels, etc., to <i>Drupada</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (also <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was present). <i>Vidura</i> said that <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was highly pleased with the alliance with <i>Drupada</i>, and asked <i>Drupada</i> to permit the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, with their mother and wife, to return to their paternal city (I, <b>206</b>)."
