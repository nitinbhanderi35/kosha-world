It is believed that this Purāṇa was originally given orally (as advice) by Agnideva to many sages, devas and Sage Vasiṣṭha. It is a vast comprehensive work dealing with every subject of importance. To give a copy of this book to a good Brahmin on the Full Moon day in the month of Mārga Sīrṣa is supposed to be a highly virtuous and meritorious deed. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Contents.</i> This large Purāṇa consists of about 420 chapters. It deals in detail with the following subjects: The Daśāvatāras of Mahāviṣṇu; Rāmāyaṇa; Mahābhārata; rules and injunctions relating to the worship of various gods (devapūjāvidhis); installation of idols in temples (devatāpratiṣṭhā); Svapnamantras; astrology; architecture and sculpture; Āyurveda; Viṣavaidya (treatment of poisons from Snakebite etc.); the principles of the drama (Nāṭaka) and other allied arts; figures of speech and all alaṃkāras in general; and physiology of the human body.
