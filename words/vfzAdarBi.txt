The following is a story given in Mahābhārata about this Vṛṣādarbhi. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once the seven hermits started for going round the earth. At this time Vṛṣādarbhi had been performing a sacrifice. Vṛṣādarbhi invoked the seven hermits and gave them his son as a gift. The child died before long. As famine was prevailing everywhere the hermits were weak and worn out by hunger. They wished to eat the flesh of the child. Vṛṣādarbhi tried to dissuade the hermits from this beastly action in vain. At last the angry King created a wicked fairy to kill the hermits. Though the fairy attacked the hermits, Indra, who had lived with the seven hermits killed the fairy. <dvsn n='NI'/>Vṛṣādarbhi was not at all behind his father Śibi in liberality. There are various stories in Mahābhārata to illustrate this."
