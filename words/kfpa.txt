(KṚPĀCĀRYA). <dvsn n='NI'/>1). <i>Genealogy.</i> Descended from Viṣṇu thus: BrahmāAtri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa— Yayāti—Puru—Janamejaya—Prācinvān—Pravīra— Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvidha—Saṃyāti— Rahovādī—Raudrāśva—Matināra—Santurodha— Duṣyanta—Bharata—Suhotā—Gala—Garda—Suketu— Bṛhatkṣetra—Hasti—Ajamīḍha—Nīla—Śānti—Suśānti— Puruja—Arka—Bhavyāśva—Pāñcāla—Mudgala. A daughter called Ahalyā was born to Mudgala. Maharṣi Gautama married her. To Gautama was born Śatānanda, to him Satyadhṛti, to him Śaradvān and to Śaradvān was born Kṛpācārya. The Purāṇas refer to the generation preceding Gautama only in the maternal line. It is said in verse 2, Chapter 130 of the Ādi Parva, that Śaradvān was the son of Gautama. According to Agni Purāṇa, Bhāgavata etc. Śaradvān, father of Kṛpa was the son of the great-grand son of Gautama and grandson of Śatānanda. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 278). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Birth of Kṛpa.</i> Though born in a family of Sages Śaradvān evinced more interest in Dhanurveda. He performed penance in the forest, with bow and arrows deposited by his side. As his penance gathered intensity the Devas got alarmed. To break his penance Indra deputed the Devatā called Jānapadī to the earth and she appeared before Śaradvān and danced, dressed only in one piece of cloth. Emission occurred to him. But, wisdom dawned on him immediately and leaving behind him the bow, arrows and deer skin he quitted the place. <dvsn n='NI'/>The semen discharged by him fell on the arrow which broke into two giving birth to a male child and a female one. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Kṛpa in the Palace.</i> One of the attendants of King Śantanu, who had come to the forest to hunt, saw the children and took them to the King. The King felt Kṛpā (pity) for them and brought them up in the palace and as they were thus brought up due to his Kṛpā they came to be called Kṛpa and Kṛpī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 130). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Kṛpa's mastery of Dhanurveda.</i> While living in the forest engaged in penance Śaradvān, with his divine power understood that the two children forsaken by him were growing up in the palace. He went to the palace and told the king details about the children. He also lived there in secret and taught Kṛpa everything contained in the four branches of Dhanurveda and the various usages in archery. Gradually Kṛpa became an ācārya (master) in Dhanurveda. Not only the Pāṇḍavas the Kauravas, the Yādavas and the Vṛṣṇis but also kings, who came from various regions of the country learned archery at the feet of Kṛpa.

Arjuna and Karṇa entered the arena for contest when Kṛpa intervened and said that Arjuna was the youngest son of Kuntī but Karṇa should specify his parentage.
