(See Vasiṣṭha). <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) <i>Other information.</i> (1) Once Arundhatī got suspicious about the character of Vasiṣṭha and as a result of misunderstanding her chaste husband her beauty suffered a set-back. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 232, Verses 27-29). <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) Arundhatī shone forth in Brahmā's assembly with other Devīs like, Pṛthvī, Hṛī, Svāhākīrtī, Surā and Śacī. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 41). <dvsn n='NI'/>(3) She outshone all other chaste women in devotion to her husband. She owed her great power to her chastity and service of her husband. (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapter 225, Verse 15). <dvsn n='NI'/>(4) The seven great Ṛṣis once offered her an honourable seat. (M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 226, Verse 8). <dvsn n='NI'/>(5) There is a story in the Mahābhārata of how Śiva once blessed Arundhatī. While the seven great Ṛṣis were staying at the Himālayas it did not rain consecutively for twelve years, and the Munis suffered much without either roots or fruits to eat. Then Arundhatī began a rigorous tapas, and Śiva appeared before her disguised as a brahmin. Since, due to the failure of rains, Arundhatī had no food with her. She cooked food with some cheap roots and served the guest with it, and with that it rained profusely all over the land. Śiva then assumed his own form and blessed Arundhatī, and from that day onwards it became a sacred spot. (M.B., Śalya Parva, Chapter 48, Verses 38-54). <dvsn n='NI'/>(6) Arundhatī once pointed out to Vṛṣdarbhi the evils of receiving remuneration (fee). (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 45). <dvsn n='NI'/>(7) On another occasion she spoke about the secret principles of ethics among others. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 130, Verses 3-11). <dvsn n='NI'/>(8) Once all the Devas eulogized Arundhatī and Brahmā blessed her. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 130, Verses 12 and 13). <dvsn n='NI'/>(9) Arundhatī and Vasiṣṭha did tapas at the sacred Sarasvatī tīrtha and entered into Samādhi. (M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 17)."
