At that time <i>Dhaumya</i>, the younger brother of <i>Devala</i>, was dwelling at the <i>tīrtha</i> named <i>Utkocaka</i>, engaged in ascetic penances. According to the counsel of the <i>Gandharva</i>, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> installed <i>Dhaumya</i> in the office of their <i>purohita</i>, and became his <i>yājyas</i>. Then they resolved to go to the <i>svayaṃvara</i> of <i>Pāñcālī</i> (i.e. <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>) (I, <b>183</b>)."
