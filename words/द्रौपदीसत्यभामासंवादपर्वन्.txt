And it was <i>Draupadī</i> who had the supervision of all this; she knew the names and features of all the girls, and knew everything about them, and even about the cowherds and shepherds. She alone knew the income and expenditure of the king and what their whole wealth was, bearing hunger and thirst, and being the first to wake up and the last to go to bed (III, <b>233</b>). <i>Draupadī</i> said that for women there is no god equal to the husband, as it is from him the wife obtains offspring, articles of enjoyment, fame, and heaven itself hereafter. In order to attract the heart of <i>Kṛṣṇa, Satyabhāmā</i> ought to let him understand that she adored him with all her heart by promptly, when she saw him enter her chamber, offering him a seat and water to wash his feet; and even if he ordered a maidservant to do anything, she ought to get up and do it herself; not to blab of whatever he should speak before her; feed those that were dear to him, and keep herself aloof from those that were hostile to him; not to stay or converse in private even with her sons <i>Pradyumna</i> and <i>Śāmba</i>; and shun wicked women (III, <b>234</b>).—§ 511: Then <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> bade farewell to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and to <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i>, etc., and called for <i>Satyabhāmā. Satyabhāmā</i> comforted <i>Draupadī</i>, saying that she would soon recover her ancient happiness, and relating of <i>Prativindhya, Śrutasoma</i>, and <i>Śrutakarman</i> (her son by <i>Arjuna</i>), and <i>Śatānīka</i> (her son by <i>Nakula</i>), and <i>Śrutasena</i> (her son by <i>Sahadeva</i>), that they were well and skilled in weapons and, like <i>Abhimanyu</i>, delighted with staying at <i>Dvāravatī</i>, and were loved by <i>Subhadrā, Pradyumna</i>, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, with his son <i>Bhānu</i>, etc., and her mother-in-law, and all the <i>Andhakas</i> and <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, with <i>Rāma</i>, etc. Then <i>Satyabhāmā</i> mounted the chariot of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and they set out for his city (III, <b>235</b>)."
