Certainly not a keeper of a shop in the country, for the story shows that it means a member of an urban tradesmanʼs guild, parallel with perfumers: <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.198.7〕 pitā te okkarika āsīd; 〔10〕 [Page158-1b] tenaukkarikāpaṇo vyavasthāpitaḥ; 〔12〕 tenaukkarika-tvaṃ tyaktvā. The story is the same as that in which <ls>Divy</ls> uses <b>aukarika</b>. I see no reason to associate with either of these words the <ab>n. pr.</ab> <b>Utkarika</b> or <b>Otk°</b>, <ab>qq.v.</ab>"
