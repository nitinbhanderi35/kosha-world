A King of Citrakūṭanagara. <dvsn n='NI'/>When once the King in the course of a hunting expedition came to the bank of a river tired and done up he saw there the very beautiful lady, Indīvaraprabhā, daughter of Maharṣi Kaṇva by Menakā. Having fallen in love with each other they went to the āśrama of the maharṣi where, at his instance, Candrāvaloka took the pledge not to kill animals in future, and Kaṇva married his daughter to the King. On their way back to the palace the couple went to sleep on the banks of a pool which belonged to a Brahmarakṣas, who caught hold of them, but released them on condition that they gave him in their stead a brahmin boy aged seven. Thus they returned to Citrakūṭa and told about the incident to minister Sumati. As advised by Sumati an idol in gold equal in size to a brahmin boy aged seven was made and a proclamation was issued that the golden idol would be given to him who, in return, give a brahmin boy seven years old. A brahmin boy was got, and he was given to the Brahmarakṣas. (Kathāsaritsāgara Śaśāṅkavatī Laṃbaka, Taraṅga 27)."
