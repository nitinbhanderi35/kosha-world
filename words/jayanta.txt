            "content": "JAYANTA I¦. Son of Indra. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Genealogy.</i> Descended from Viṣṇu in the following order: Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Indra—Jayanta. Jayanta was the son born to Indra by his wife Śacīdevī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 112, Stanzas 3 and 4). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Jayanta lost one eye.</i> During his forest life, Śrī Rāma lived with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa on the mountain Citrakūṭa for some days. Once Śrī Rāma, being very tired of walking in the forest fell asleep with his head in the lap of Sītā. Taking this chance Jayanta came in the shape of a crow and scratched the breast of Sītā with his claws. Sītā cried and Śrī Rāma woke up and saw Jayanta in the shape of a crow. Rāma got angry and shot the Brahmāstra (a divine arrow) against Jayanta. Fear of life made him fly throughout the whole of the three worlds. Even Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara were unable to protect him, All the while the divine arrow followed him. Finally having no go he came and fell at the feet of Śrī Rāma. Śrī Rāma said that the Brahmāstra could never become futile and so the arrow must hit his right eye. Accordingly the arrow struck at his right eye and thus Jayanta lost his right eye. In Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa this story is stated with some slight changes. According to Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa, this incident took place when Sītā had been drying raw flesh. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 38). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Jayanta hidden in the ocean.</i> After getting the boons Rāvaṇa became arrogant and with a big army went to the realm of the gods. Rāvaṇa engaged Indra in a fierce battle. In that fight Meghanāda the son of Rāvaṇa attacked Jayanta, who swooned and fell down. Immediately Pulomā, the father of Śacīdevī, gathered Jayanta in his hands unseen by anybody and hid him in the sea. After the disappearance of Jayanta the battle entered the second stage. Thinking that his son Jayanta had been killed, Indra began to fight with Rāvaṇa with more vigour than before. In the battle which followed Meghanāda subdued Indra and made him a captive. Taking Indra and the celestial maids as captives, Rāvaṇa and his men went to Laṅkā. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Jayanta became Bamboo.</i> Once Agastya came to Indra's durbar. Indra arranged for the dance of Urvaśī in honour of Agastya's visit. In the midst of the dance Urvaśī saw Jayanta before her and she fell in love with him. Consequently her steps went out of beat. Nārada who was playing his lute called Mahatī went wrong. Agastya got angry and cursed Jayanta and changed him to a bamboo. Urvaśī was cursed to become a woman with the name Mādhavī. Agastya cursed Nārada that his lute Mahatī would become the lute of the people of the world. (Vāyu Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Other information.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) In the stealing of the Pārijātapuṣpa (the flower of a paradise tree) Jayanta fought with Pradyumna the son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and was defeated. (Viṣṇu Parva Chapter 73). <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) Jayanta was defeated by Śūrapadma, an Asura, in a battle. (Skanda Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa)."
