Then <i>Gāyatrī (Sāvitrī</i>) appeared and granted him the boon that his wish for recitation should go on increasing, and his absorption into meditation (<i>samādhi</i>) be more complete. She added that he should not have to go to hell, thither where great brahmans go, but to the region of <i>Brahmán</i>, and that <i>Dharma</i>, etc. (α), would come to him in person. He continued engaged in recitation for 1,000 celestial years. Then <i>Dharma</i> came to him and told him to cast off his body in order to win regions of bliss; but he did not wish to reside in heaven except with his body, but only took pleasure in recitation. <i>Time, Mṛtyu</i>, and <i>Yama</i> came and told him the same. The brahman gave them <i>arghya</i> and <i>pādya. Ikṣvāku</i>, who had set out on a <i>tīrtha-</i> <i>yātrā</i>, came and was given <i>arghya</i> and <i>pādya</i>. The brahman wished to give him something; <i>Ikṣvāku</i>, as a kṣatriya, would not take anything except battle, but only himself give; at last, however, he asked to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the brahman's recitations, but when the brahman consented he would not take them, and asked the brahman what those fruits were. The brahman did not know, as his recitations had never been connected with any special purpose; he told the king that Truth required that he should take them as he had asked for them (the signification of Truth). <i>Dharma</i> and Heaven (<i>Svargaḥ</i>) seconded the brahman. <i>Ikṣvāku</i> wished to give his own merits instead, but in vain then <i>Ikṣvāku</i> agreed to accept half the brahman's merit on the condition that the brahman should take half of his own, but he was refused. At this time two ungainly individuals came there, <i>Virūpa</i> and <i>Vikṛta</i> (afterwards disclosed to be <i>Desire</i> and <i>Wrath</i>) <i>Virūpa</i> said that he owed <i>Vikṛta</i> the merits of the gift of a cow, but that <i>Vikṛta</i> refused to take repayment (in the form of the merit of having given two <i>kapilā</i> cows with calves to an <i>uñchavṛtti</i>); <i>Vikṛta</i> declared that <i>Virūpa</i> owed him nothing; they asked <i>Ikṣvāku</i> to decide the question. <i>Ikṣvāku</i> hesitated; the brahman threatened to curse him. <i>Ikṣvāku</i> would give him some drops of water that had fallen upon his hand. <i>Virūpa</i> approved of this arrangement, and said that <i>Vikṛta</i> really did not owe him anything; “we appealed to thee for thy own sake.” <i>Bhīṣma</i> said that a reciter goes to <i>Brahmán</i>, or <i>Agni</i>, or <i>Sūrya</i>. whose attributes he catches stupefied by attachment (<i>rāgeṇa</i>); and so also if he goes to <i>Soma</i>, etc. (β); if, however, he goes to, those regions after having freed himself from attachment, he enters the Supreme and Imperishable, and becomes <i>Bráhman</i> (XII, <b>199</b>). The brahman accepted, worshipped <i>Dharma</i>, etc. (γ), and set himself to his recitations again. Asked by <i>Ikṣvāku</i>, he agreed that he should go half and half with the king. <i>Indra</i> came there with D., Lp., Sā., Vi., etc. (δ), and said to the brahman and the king that they had attained to success (<i>[saṃ]siddhaḥ</i>). Those two withdrew their senses from the objects of the world; fixing <i>Praṇa</i>, etc. (ε), in the heart, they concentrated the mind in <i>Prāṇa</i> and <i>Apāna</i> united together, etc. (description). <i>Brahmán</i> welcomed the fiery flame that had issued from the head of the brahman, saying: “Reciters attain to the same end as the <i>yogins</i>; but as regards reciters, the honour is ordained for them that <i>Brahmán</i> himself shall advance to receive them”; then he once more imparted consciousness into that splendour; the brahman then entered the mouth of <i>Brahmán</i>, and so did the king. The deities rejoiced. <i>Brahmán</i> said that so also would he that reads “the great <i>Smṛti</i>” and “the <i>Anusmṛti</i>” (i.e. resp. “the six <i>Aṅgas</i> and <i>Manu</i>, etc.,” Nīl.) in this way attain to the same region with <i>Brahmán</i>; and so also he who is devoted to <i>Yoga</i>. Then <i>Brahmán</i> disappeared, and the deities, having honoured <i>Dharma</i>, returned to their respective abodes (XII, <b>200</b>)."
