On that occasion the hermit told Arjuna about the previous history of Caṇḍī, who had been cursed by the hermit Uddālaka. It is mentioned in Jaimini Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 96, that Arjuna later redeemed Caṇḍī from the curse."

A Purāṇic story about this hermit's marrying the fifty daughters of Māndhātā is given below. <dvsn n='NI'/>Saubhari saw two fishes engaged in coition, while he was doing penance on the banks of the Yamunā. This sight aroused matrimonial thoughts in the hermit's mind. He instantly approached Māndhātā and informed him of his desire to marry a princess. <dvsn n='NI'/>Māndhātā did not like to give his daughter in marriage to the old hermit. Concealing his thought, he told the hermit as follows:—“Out of my fifty daughters, she who wishes to be your wife, shall be given to you.” Saubhari, who had already read the thought of Māndhātā entered the harem in the shape of a handsome fine youth, and all the fifty damsels liked him. Thus Saubhari married all of them, and begot hundred sons of each of them. <dvsn n='NI'/>This matrimonial life lasted for some time. At last the hermit grew weary of this life. Discarding everything, Saubhari went to the forest. His wives, who also had become disinterested in worldly enjoyment, followed him. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 9; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, 4, 2, 3; Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa 262; Garuḍa Purāṇa, 1, 138)."
