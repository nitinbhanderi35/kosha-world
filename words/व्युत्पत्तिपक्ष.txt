The grammarians hold that Panini held the अव्युत्पत्तिपक्ष,i.e. the view that not all words in a language can be derived but only some of them can be so done, and contrast him (i.e.Panini) with an equally great grammarian Sakatayana who stated that every word has to be derived: cf. न्यग्रोधयतीति न्यग्रोध इति व्युत्पत्तिपक्षे नियमार्थम् ! अव्युत्पत्तिपक्ष विध्यर्थम् Kas.on P.VII.3.6."
