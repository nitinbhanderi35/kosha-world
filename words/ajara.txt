Tapantaka, the minister of King Vatsa, told him the story of a man named Ajara to illustrate the law that all people will have to suffer the consequences of their actions in a previous birth. The story is given below:— <dvsn n='NI'/>Once upon a time, there lived a King named Vinayaśīla in Vilāsapura, in the city of Śrīkaṇṭhanagarī. After some years, the King was affected by wrinkles of old age. A physician named Taruṇacandra came to the palace to cure the King of his wrinkles. “The King should remain alone in the interior of the earth for full eight months. He has to use a medicine while remaining there. It should not even be seen by anyone else. I myself am to administer the medicine”—This was the physician's prescription. The King agreed. Accordingly the King and the physician spent six months in the interior of the earth. After that the physician, after a search, found a man who exactly resembled the King and brought him to the interior of the earth. After two more months, the physician murdered the King and came out with the new man. The people welcomed him with honour as the King who was cured of his wrinkles. This man was Ajara. After some time, the physician approached Ajara for his reward. Ajara said: “It is by my Karmaphala (consequence of my actions in my previous birth) that I have become King. In my previous birth I renounced my body after doing penance. According to the boon which God gave me on that occasion, I have become King in my present birth”. The physician returned empty-handed. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratnaprabhālaṃbaka, 6th Taraṅga)."
