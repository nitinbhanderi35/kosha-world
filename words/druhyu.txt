Two sons, Yadu and Turvasu were born to Yayāti, the son of Nahuṣa, by his wife Devayānī and three sons Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru by his wife Śarmiṣṭhā. Druhyu was cursed by his father because he did not comply with the request of his father to exchange his old age with the youth of his son. The curse was that his desires would not be realized, that he would stay in places where he would not like to stay that his kingdom would be lost and that he would be called Bhoja.
