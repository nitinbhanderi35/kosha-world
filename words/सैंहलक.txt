They are mentioned along with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas, and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)<sup>434</sup> who paid homage to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial Gupta Garuḍa seal (<i>Garutmadaṅka</i>) by which they would be left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment (<i>bhukti</i>) and administration (<i>śāsana</i>) of their respective territories.<sup>435</sup> If literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta. When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṃhala (Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justified in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense without corroborative evidence.<sup>436</sup> But the question arises that was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?<sup>437</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an independent evidence of its political relation with Samudagupta. <dvsn n='P'/>We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62) of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa (<i>chi-mi-kia-</i> <i>po-mo</i> = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a contemporary of Samudragupta (<i>San-meou-to-lo-kin-to</i>).<sup>438</sup> He, according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission, and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north of the Bodhi tree.<sup>439</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magnificant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grandeur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’, one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into which Siṃhala is included”.<sup>440</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhamihira<sup>441</sup> mentions both of them separately as situated in the South. <dvsn n='P'/>Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,<sup>442</sup> with Maldives,<sup>443</sup> with the northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay of Bengal,<sup>444</sup> and with an island off the south-east Coast of Ceylon.<sup>445</sup> All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>446</sup> who remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gratuitous.<sup>447</sup> He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while entreating Sītā to be his wife says: <i>“Laṅkānāma samudrasya</i> <i>madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”</i><sup>448</sup> Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategical position of Laṅkā: <i>Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.</i><sup>449</sup> Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with <i>‘Purīm Laṅkām’</i> writes: <i>“Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.</i><sup>450</sup> With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: <i>sa</i> <i>setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.</i><sup>451</sup> In the Skanda Purāṇa<sup>452</sup> and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references to Laṇkā.<sup>453</sup> All these passages point distinctly to the great sea on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā. <dvsn n='P'/>The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from Ceylon.<sup>454</sup> This is hardly convincing for the separate mention of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name. As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed off as a <i>dvīpa,</i> and the two names were used in the same geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus: <i>“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.</i><sup>455</sup> Hiuen Tsang also mentions <i>Seng-ka-lo</i> (Ceylon) which included <i>Leug-</i> <i>ka</i> (Laṅkā).<sup>456</sup> As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion) was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.<sup>457</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.<sup>458</sup> We may assume further, as seems very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its literary name as well. Mention is made of <i>Laṅkādvīpa</i> even in medieval inscriptions.<sup>459</sup> The Madras museum plates of Jaṭilavarman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as <i>Ilangai.</i><sup>460</sup> Epigraphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.<sup>461</sup> In another inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the shore.<sup>462</sup> In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated as Siṅgala-deśam,<sup>463</sup> Sīlam<sup>464</sup> and Sihala.<sup>465</sup> All this evidence favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably, correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī, and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by <i>Palaesi-</i> <i>mundus</i> or <i>Palaesimoundon</i> which itself was transformed into <i>Salike, Sereṇdiva</i> derived from Pali <i>Sihala</i> or <i>Sihala dīpa.</i><sup>466</sup> The name <i>Palaesimoundon</i> is very plausibly based on <i>“pāre</i> <i>samudrasya”,</i><sup>467</sup> in the description given of Laṅkā as noted above. Ptolemy's Simoundon<sup>468</sup> also refers to that name. But in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called <i>Salike</i> which responds to <i>Siele diba</i> of <i>Kosmas Indicopleustes</i><sup>469</sup> both of which have their sources in <i>Sihalam</i> “the Pāli form of Sanskrit Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other names such as <i>Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,</i><sup>470</sup> the last one yielding to Ceylon. Marco Polo's <i>Seilan</i><sup>471</sup> is a nearer approach to the modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have been derived from <i>Sela</i> or ‘precious stone’, hence the island was anciently called <i>Ratnadvīpa.</i><sup>472</sup> An Arab historian called it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island also implies reference to gems. The name <i>Sailān</i> also occurs in the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.<sup>473</sup> Al-Beruni called it <i>Singaldīb.</i><sup>474</sup> Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once abounding in lions.<sup>475</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We may note here that there are references to another Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.<sup>476</sup> It was placed to the east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evidently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the kingdom of <i>Siṃhapura</i> mentioned by Hiuen Tsang."
