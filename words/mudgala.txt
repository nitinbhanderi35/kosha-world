Durvāsas once came to the āśrama of Mudgala in Kurukṣetra where he was living on alms received by begging. Durvāsas came naked. Mudgala gave all that he got that day to Durvāsas. The latter ate to his heart's content and smeared on his naked body what remained after his meal. Mudgala never got angry. This continued for days together and not for once did Mudgala get angry. Durvāsas was immensely pleased with this behaviour of Mudgala and he offered to send him to heaven with his body. Devas came with a Vimāna at once. Mudgala after enquiring about the conveniences and luxuries of heaven refused to go. (Chapter 261, Vana Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Mudgala, who was well versed in the Vedas, was a priest in the Sarpasatra of Janamejaya. (Śloka 9, Chapter 53, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Mudgala visited Bhīṣma lying on his bed of arrows. (Śloka 9, Chapter 47, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Once Śatadyumna gave Mudgala a golden house.
