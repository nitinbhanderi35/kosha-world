Seeing this Indra feared that he might be deposed. So he stealthily took away the sacrificial horse of Vijitāśva. <dvsn n='NI'/>There was a fierce battle between Indra and Vijitāśva in which Indra was defeated, and Vijitāśva recovered the stolen horse from Indra. It was from that day onwards that this son of Pṛthu got the name Vijitāśva. Being pleased with the King at this expert fighting, Devendra taught him the art of vanishing. (Bhāgavata. Skandha 4)."
