It was as a result of this virtuous deed that the sage got the name Prabhākara. By his great knowledge and eminence he kept glowing the fame of Atrikula earned by generations. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sage Prabhākara conducted a Yāga and on the occasion the devas presented him with great wealth and ten sons (Harivaṃśa, 1. 81-8. 17)."
