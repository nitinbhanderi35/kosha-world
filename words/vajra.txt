Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 72, that after the extermination of the Yādavas by the mausala fight (the fight with grass grown from the filings of the iron-pestle), Arjuna anointed Vajra as the King of the remaining Yādavas. When the Pāṇḍavas began the Mahāprasthāna (the great departure), Yudhiṣṭhira called Subhadrā and instructed her to look after Vajra with particular care. (M.B. Mahā Prasthāna Parva, Chapter 1, Stanza 8)."
