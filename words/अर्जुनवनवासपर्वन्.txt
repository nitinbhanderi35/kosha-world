After some time robbers lifted the cattle of a <i>brahman</i>, who then repaired to <i>Khāṇḍava-</i> <i>prastha</i> and reproved the <i>Pāṇḍavas. Arjuna</i> heard it; but the chamber where the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had their weapons being then occupied by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with <i>Kṛṣṇā, Arjuna</i> was obliged to violate the established rule by entering the chamber. Then, armed with the bow and attired in mail and riding on his war-chariot decked with flagstaffs, he pursued the thieves and compelled them to give up the booty. Then, notwithstanding <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> objections, he went to the forest to live there for twelve years (I, <b>213</b>).—§ 248: <i>Arjuna</i> set out followed by <i>brahmans</i> conversant with the <i>vedas</i> and <i>vedāṅgas</i> and devoted to the contemplation of the Supreme Spirit (<i>adhyātmacintakāḥ</i>), by mendicants (<i>bhaikṣāḥ</i>) devoted to <i>Bhagavat (Bhagavadbhaktāḥ</i>), by reciters of the <i>Purāṇas (sūtāḥ</i> <i>Paurāṇikāḥ</i>), and by reciters of sacred stories (<i>divyākhyānāni</i>), etc., and settled at <i>Gaṅgādvāra</i>, where the <i>brahmans</i> performed innumerable <i>agnihotras</i>. One day when <i>Arjuna</i> had performed his ablutions in the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, and offered the oblations of water to his deceased ancestors, and when he was about to rise up from the stream desirous of performing his sacrificial rites before the fire, he was drawn away to the bottom of the water by <i>Ulūpī</i>, the daughter of the <i>Nāga</i> king <i>Kauravya</i> of the lineage of <i>Airāvata</i>, urged by the god of desire. There he saw a sacrificial fire, where he performed his sacrificial rites, by which <i>Agni</i> was much gratified. <i>Ulūpī</i> persuaded him that it was a greater merit to give himself up to her than to keep the vow of a <i>brahmacārin</i>, and having spent the night there, he in the morning, accompanied by <i>Ulūpī</i>, came back to <i>Gaṅgādvāra. Ulūpī</i>, taking leave of him there, said that he would be invincible in water (I, <b>214</b>).—§ 249: Then he set out towards the <i>Himavat</i> and came to <i>Agastyavaṭa</i> and the mountain of <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>; in <i>Bhṛgutuṅga</i> he bestowed many thousands of kine, etc., on <i>brahmans</i> and visited many <i>tīrthas</i> (especially all those in <i>Aṅga, Vaṅga</i>, and <i>Kaliṅga</i>). At the gate of the kingdom of <i>Kaliṅga</i> the <i>brahmans</i> desisted from following him further; he crossed <i>Kaliṅga</i>, beheld the <i>Mahendra</i> mountain adorned with the ascetics, and went to <i>Maṇipūra</i>, proceeding slowly along the seaṣore. There he married <i>Citrāṅgadā</i>, the daughter of king <i>Citravāhana (b</i>), and dwelt there for three years. When <i>Citrāṅgadā</i> had given birth to a son, <i>Arjuna</i> set out on his wanderings again (I, <b>215</b>).—§ 250: Then <i>Arjuna</i> went to the <i>tīrthas</i> at the southern ocean. There five <i>tīrthas</i> were shunned on account of five crocodiles that seized the devotees: <i>Agastyatīrtha, Saubhadra, Pauloma, Kārandhama</i> (giving the results of a horse-sacrifice), and <i>Bhāradvāja's tīrtha. Arjuna</i> plunged into the <i>Saubhadra</i> (so called after a <i>maharṣi</i>), and was seized by a crocodile, which he dragged to the shore. It then became the <i>apsaras Vargā</i>, the friend of <i>Dhanapati</i> (Kubera). When she with her four companions (<i>Saurabheyī</i>, <i>Samīcī, Vudvudā</i>, and <i>Latā</i>), going to the abode of <i>Kubera</i>, had in vain tempted an ascetic <i>brahman</i>, that <i>brahman</i> had cursed them, saying that they should become crocodiles for 100 years (I, <b>216</b>). <i>Vargā</i> said: “As we asked the <i>ṛṣi</i> to grant us pardon, he said: ‘100 and 100,000 are all indicative of eternity; but the words 100 as employed by me is to be understood as a limited period; you will be delivered by an exalted individual, and those waters shall become sacred and purifying under the name of <i>Nārītīrthāni</i>.’ The <i>devarṣi Nārada</i> directed us to these lakes, and said that <i>Dhanañjaya</i> (i.e. Arjuna) would soon deliver us.” <i>Arjuna</i> then also delivered the other four <i>apsarases</i>. Then he proceeded to <i>Maṇipūra</i> to see <i>Citrāṅgadā</i>; with her he had begotten king <i>Babhruvāhana</i>. Then he proceeded towards <i>Gokarṇa</i> (I, <b>217</b>).—§ 251: Then <i>Arjuna</i> visited the <i>tīrthas</i> on the shores of the western ocean, and arrived at <i>Prabhāsa</i>. There <i>Madhusūdana</i> (= Kṛṣṇa) visited him, and he and <i>Arjuna</i>, who were the <i>ṛṣis Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, sported there for some time. Then they went to the <i>Raivataka</i> mountain, after <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had caused this mountain to be well adorned by many artifices; there he saw the performances of the actors and the dancers. The next morning they set out for <i>Dvārakā</i>, welcomed by the <i>Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis</i>, and <i>Andhakas</i>. There he dwelt in the mansion of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> for many days (I, <b>218</b>)."
