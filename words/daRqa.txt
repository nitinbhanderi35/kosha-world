This wicked Daṇḍaka used to steal the wealth of the Brāhmaṇas, kill those who trusted him, speak lies, rape the women of others, drink liquor, eat the flesh of cows, mingle with wicked people and do various other sinful deeds daily. Daṇḍa once went to a Vaiṣṇavite temple to commit robbery. When he reached the steps of the temple he wiped his legs which were wet, on the ground and a small depression that was there, was levelled by the drawing of his legs. He broke the lock with an iron rod and entered the temple. Inside the temple he saw Kṛṣṇa, clad in yellow robes lying on a beautiful cot, with his spouse Rādhā. The thief instantly bowed before the spouse of Rādhā. By this act his sins were washed away. Still impelled by his evil nature, he took the silk garment of Kṛṣṇa, spread it on the ground, collected as many things as he could take, placed them in the garment and making them into a bundle, got out of the temple with shaky feet. The bundle fell on the ground with a loud noise. Hearing the noise the neighbours woke up and looked out. The thief began to run and was bitten by a poisonous snake and fell down dead. The men of Yama (God of death) tied the spirit of the thief with a rope and took him before Yama. Citragupta looked into his accounts and informed Yama that he had committed all the sins. Yama asked if there was any good deed to his account. Then Citragupta said “When this great sinner was going to commit theft in a Vaiṣṇavite temple, at the steps of the temple, he levelled a pit by the mud on his leg, and that single good deed on his part has wiped out all his sins.” Hearing this Yama gave him a golden seat and showed hospitality and then bowed before him and said “By the soil on your legs you have purified my abode today. I am grateful to you. Now you may go to the blissful world of Viṣṇu where there are no deaths or births or sorrow”. Hearing this Daṇḍa entered Vaikuṇṭha. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 1)."
