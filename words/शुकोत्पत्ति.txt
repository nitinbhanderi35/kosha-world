Questioned by Yudhiṣṭhira about <i>Śuka</i>, whose mind became bent on Bráhman when he was a mere boy, Bhīṣma answered: The Ṛ. did not make merit depend upon age, etc., but upon the study of the Vedas and upon tapas; the merit of 1,000 horse-sacrifices or 100 <i>vājapeyas</i> cannot come up to even (1/16) of the merit that arises from <i>yoga</i>. Once on the summit of <i>Meru, Mahādeva</i> sported with his followers and <i>Pārvatī</i>, while <i>Vyāsa</i>, devoted to yoga and dhāraṇā, practised austerities for 100 years for the sake of obtaining a son, subsisting on air alone, adoring <i>Mahādeva</i>. Thither went Ṛ., B.-ṛ., Lp., S., V., Ā., R., <i>Sūrya</i>, <i>Candramas, Indra</i>, M., the <i>Oceans</i>, the <i>Rivers</i>, A., D., G., <i>Nārada, Parvata, Viśvāvasu</i>, Si., and Aps. This has been told to me by <i>Mārkaṇḍeya. Śiva</i> granted him that he would have a son like to <i>Fire, Wind, Earth, Water</i>, and <i>Space</i>, and devoted to <i>Bráhman</i> (XII, <b>324</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> was one day employed in rubbing his sticks to make a fire, when he beheld the Aps. <i>Ghṛtācī</i>, and fell in love with her. When she approached, transformed into a she-parrot, he dropped his seed, which became a son, who, from this circumstance, came to be called by the name of <i>Śuka. Gaṅgā</i> came and bathed him in her waters; G. sung, and Aps. danced, etc. <i>Viśvāvasu, Tumburu, Nā., Hāhā</i>, and <i>Hūhū</i> eulogized the birth of <i>Śuka</i>; there came Lp. with <i>Śakra</i>, D., D.-ṛ., and B.-ṛ.; <i>Māruta</i> showered celestial flowers; <i>Śiva</i>, together with <i>Pārvatī</i>, invested <i>Śuka</i> with the sacred thread; <i>Śakra</i> gave him a celestial <i>kamaṇḍalu</i> and celestial robes, etc. As soon as <i>Śuka</i> was born, the Vedas, including the mysteries and abstracts (<i>sarahasyāḥ sasaṅgrahāḥ</i>), came to dwell in him, just as they dwelt in his father. <i>Śuka</i> selected <i>Bṛhaspati</i> for his preceptor, remembering the universal practice. Having studied the Vedas, the tradition (<i>itihāsaṃ</i>), and the state policy (<i>rājaśāstrāṇi), Śuka</i> returned home, after paying his preceptor the tuition fee. Adopting the vow of a brahmacārin he practised the hardest penances, even in his childhood. Taking no pleasure in the three modes of life (the domestic, etc.), he only kept in view the law of emancipation (<i>mokṣadharmānudarśinaḥ</i>) (XII, <b>325</b>). (For continuation v. <i>Śukakṛti</i>.)"
