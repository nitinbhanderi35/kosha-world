When those things were divided among them all, Devendra took possession of 14 gems in an unauthorised manner. When Jalandhara, through his messenger Durvāraṇa, demanded Devendra to return the gems, not only did he not return them but he also declared war against Jalandhara. When war broke out Jalandhara hesitated as to whether he should fight with Viṣṇu or with Śiva. Durvāraṇa advised him first to fight with Śiva. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa, Chapter 16)."
