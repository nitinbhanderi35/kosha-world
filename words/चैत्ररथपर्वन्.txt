Caitraratha[ṃ] parvan.) § 216: Within a few days there came a <i>brahman</i> to the abode of their host, whom they asked to narrate the birth of <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> from the sacrificial fire, and that of <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> from the centre of the <i>vedī</i>, and that of <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, and how <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> learnt the use of all weapons from <i>Droṇa</i>, and how the friendship of <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Drupada</i> was broken (I, <b>165</b>).—§ 217: The <i>brahman</i> related (not mentioning <i>Aśvatthāman</i>) the birth of <i>Droṇa</i> (§ 200), his friendship with <i>Drupada</i>, and his visit to <i>Rāma</i> (§ 201; he obtained the <i>Brahmāstra</i>, v. 6340), the breaking of his friendship with <i>Drupada</i> (§ 202), how <i>Bhīṣma</i> prevailed upon him to teach the princes, etc. (both <i>Arjuna</i> and the others promised to give what he might ask for his fee, v. 6346), and the chastisement of <i>Drupada</i> (§ 209; <i>Drupada</i> resides in <i>Chattravatī</i>, v. 6348) (I, <b>166</b>).—§ 218: Draupadīsambhava (q.v.).—§ 219: Hearing the words of the <i>brahman</i>, the sons of <i>Kuntī</i> seemed to be, as it were, pierced with darts. <i>Kuntī</i> proposed to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that they should go to the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, a country they had not seen before, and he consented for his part. When the other brothers had likewise consented, they set out for the town of <i>Drupada</i> (I, <b>168</b>).— § 220: When they were living disguised, <i>Vyāsa</i> came and told them that formerly the daughter of a <i>ṛṣi</i>, notwithstanding her beauty, obtained no husband, and therefore by austerities propitiated <i>Śaṅkara</i> five times, saying “Give me a husband.” Accordingly the god said (notwithstanding her objection) that she should in a future life have five husbands. “That damsel is <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, appointed to be the wife of ye all; go therefore to the capital of the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and dwell ye there.” He then left them (I, <b>169</b>).—§ 221: After <i>Vyāsa</i> had gone away, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> proceeded [towards the <i>Pāñcālas</i>] in a northerly direction, walking day and night till they reached the <i>tīrtha Somāśrayāyaṇa</i> (“the shrine of <i>Rudra</i> with the crescent mark on his brow,” PCR. with Nīl.). Then they arrived at the <i>Gaṅgā; Dhanañjaya</i> (i.e. <i>Arjuna</i>) walked before them, torch in hand. The <i>Gandharva</i> king with his wives was then sporting there in the <i>Geṅgā</i>. Bending his bow to a circle, he said, “Excepting the first 80 <i>lavas</i>, the <i>muhūrta</i> (<i>prasthānakālaṃ</i>, Nīl.) that begins with the twilight preceding nightfall has been appointed for the <i>Yakṣas, Gandharvas</i>, and <i>Rākṣasas</i>, capable of going everywhere at will; the rest has been appointed for man to do his work. If therefore men, wandering during those moments from greed of gain, come near us, both we and the <i>rākṣasas</i> slay those fools. Therefore persons acquainted with the <i>Vedas</i> never applaud those men, who then approach any piece of water. Stay ye at a distance. Know that I am <i>Aṅgāraparṇa</i> (= <i>Citraratha</i>, v. 6475; cf. LIA. i, 666/814), the friend of <i>Kubera</i>, and this my forest is also called <i>Aṅgāraparṇa</i>, where neither <i>kauṇapas</i> (i.e. <i>rākṣasas</i>), nor <i>śṛṅgins</i> (a horned animal, see BR.; according to Nīl. it is = <i>kāpālikāḥ</i>, a Śivaitic sect), nor gods, nor men can come.” <i>Arjuna</i> replied: “Whether it be day, night, or twilight, who can bar others from the ocean, the <i>Himālaya</i>, and <i>Gangā?</i>” (<i>b). Arjuna</i> burnt the <i>Gandharva's</i> chariot with the <i>Āgneya</i> weapon, given by <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (the preceptor of <i>Indra</i>) to <i>Bharadvāja</i>, by him to <i>Agniveśya</i>, by him to <i>Droṇa</i>, by <i>Droṇa</i> to <i>Arjuna</i>, and dragged him, who had become unconscious, by the hair. His wife <i>Kumbhīnasī</i> prevailed upon <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and he commanded <i>Arjuna</i> to spare him. He declared that, instead of his former name, <i>Citraratha</i> (“who has a variegated chariot”), he should now be called <i>Dagdharatha</i> (“whose chariot has been burnt”), and imparted to <i>Arjuna</i> the <i>Gāndharvī vidyā</i> called <i>Cākṣuṣī (c</i>). He also gave <i>Arjuna</i> and each of his brothers one hundred horses born in the country of the Gandharvas (<i>Gandharvajānāṃ</i>), endued with the speed of wind and employed in carrying the gods and Gandharvas, a portion of <i>Indra's vajra</i> (“thunderbolt”) (<i>d). Arjuna</i> in return gave him the <i>Āgneya</i> weapon, and asked him why they, though skilled in the <i>Vedas</i>, had been censured by him. He replied that it was because they were without fires, without sacriflces, and without a <i>brahman</i> walking before them. “The <i>Yakskas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas</i>, <i>Piśācas, Uragas</i>, and <i>Dānavas</i> know the history of the <i>Kuru</i> race; I have heard from <i>Nārada</i> and other <i>devarṣis</i> the deeds of your ancestors. I have been vanquished by thee in battle on account of the <i>brahmacarya</i> being rigidly observed: a <i>kṣattriya</i>, who is addicted to lust, if he fights in the night, can never escape with life; but even if addicted to lust, he who has a <i>purohita</i> may vanquish all wanderers of the night. Therefore, O <i>Tāpatya!</i> kings should always select a fit <i>purohita</i>” (I, <b>170</b>).—§ 222: <i>Citraratha</i> related Tapatyupākhyāna (q.v.).—§§ 223—7: Vāsiṣṭha (q.v.).— § 228: Aurvopākhyāna (q.v.).—§ 229: Vasiṣṭopākhyāna (q.v.).—§ 230: Dhaumya-purohitakaraṇa (q.v.)."
