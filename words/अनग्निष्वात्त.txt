This word is explained by a commentator of the Yajurveda: ‘not tasted by (स्वात्त) i. e. not burnt by fire, not having received the obsequies in conformity with the religious rites’ and it appears therefore as a synonyme of अनग्निदग्ध, as well as the converse of अग्नि- ष्वात्त which, according to the same commentator, would be a synonyme of अग्निदग्ध. Anagniṣvātta does not occur in the list of the Pitṛs which are given in the law books and in the Purāṇas, while अग्निदग्ध and अग्निष्वात्त (qq. vv.) are named there as distinct classes and explained in a different manner. The etymology given, which identifies स्वात्त and स्वादित, seems moreover objectionable. E. अ and अग्निष्वात्त."
