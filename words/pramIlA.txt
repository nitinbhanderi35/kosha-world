It was Arjuna who followed the sacrificial horse. Roaming about without anybody daring to tie it the horse reached Strīrājya and Pramīlā tied the horse. Arjuna challenged her and in the fight that ensued Pramīlā defeated Arjuna. At that time there was a voice from heaven which said “Arjuna, you will never be able to take back the horse after defeating Pramīlā. So if you want to save the sacrificial horse, enter into a truce with her and make her your wife.” Arjuna took the advice and saved the horse after marrying Pramīlā. (Jaiminīya, Aśvamedha Parva, 21—22)."
