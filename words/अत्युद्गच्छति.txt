Note however (aside from <lang>Pali</lang> accuggata, apparently only used as adjective, often with specialized meanings) <lang>Pali</lang> accuggamma, <lex>ger.</lex>, used of water-plants, <i>having grown out above</i> (the water, <lex>acc.</lex> or <lex>abl.</lex>); but <lang>BHS</lang> uses (only) abhyudgacchati in this sense, according to unanimous tradition, <ab>tho</ab> perhaps this tradition may be erroneous. Contrariwise, there is even in <lang>Pali</lang> tradition some confusion between abbhugg- and accugg- in this group; see <ls>CPD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> abbhuggata (a <ab>var.</ab> accuggata occurs with subject yaso)."
