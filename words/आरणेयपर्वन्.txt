III, <b>311—315</b>). § 548: Asked by Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana related what the Pāṇḍavas did after having rescued Kṛṣṇā (from Jayadratha). The Pāṇḍavas left Kāmyaka and returned to Dvaitavana with Kṛṣṇā. Once a deer carried off a brahman's araṇī and mantha, was pursued by the Pāṇḍavas, and suddenly became invisible. Bhīma repented that he had not slain the prātikāmin, Arjuna that he had not slain Karṇa, and Sahadeva that he had not slain Śakuni. Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, and Bhīma were successively sent to fetch water, but caused to drop down dead by a Yakṣa. At last Yudhiṣṭhira himself went, answered thirty-four questions put by the Yakṣa, chose that Nakula should be revived, rescued all his brothers, learnt that the Yakṣa was his father Dharma (<i>c</i>), was granted the boon that the brahman would recover his araṇī and mantha, that the Pāṇḍavas would manage to live the thirteenth year unrecognized in Virāṭa's kingdom, and that Yudhiṣṭhira (who was born of Dharma, as Vidura of a portion of Dharma) should overcome covetousness, etc. The Pāṇḍavas asked permission of the brahmans to live the thirteenth year in concealment from the Dhārtarāṣṭras, Duryodhana, etc., and Karṇa and Saubala. Dhaumya, etc., consoled Yudhiṣṭhira: “Even the gods (Indra, <i>d</i>; Viṣṇu, <i>e</i>; Agni, <i>f</i>; Aurva, <i>g</i>; Vivasvat, <i>h</i>) have wandered in disguise for the purpose of overcoming foes.” The brahmans (yatis, munis) went back to their homes, and the Pāṇḍavas and Dhaumya set out with Kṛṣṇā, and the next day proceeded for a krośa, and then sat down in order to take counsel of each other."
