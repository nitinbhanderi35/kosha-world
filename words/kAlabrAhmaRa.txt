A great effulgence that emanated from his head two hundred years after his continuous Japa (Chanting of mantras) blocked the passage of sky-walkers (Devas) and spread to the three worlds. When Brahmā and others asked him to choose any boon, he said that he wanted nothing but chanting the Lord's name and mantras. Again, Brahmā insisted on the brahmin's choosing some boon or other, and then he removed himself to the northern planes of the Himālayas, where also he continued chanting mantras. There too his effulgence became so powerful that Indra deputed celestial women to obstruct his Japa, but they could do nothing in the matter. Then Indra deputed Kāla to end the brahmin's life, but he failed in the attempt. Ultimately King Ikṣvāku came to the brahmin and asked for half the power he had earned by his tapas, which the brahmin readily granted. And, Ikṣvāku became thus famous all over the worlds. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Sūryaprabhālambaka)."
