When they were a long distance away from the shore the boats carrying them capsized in a storm and the prince and army were drowned in the sea. The prince then prayed to the A vinīdevas and they saved him and his army from the sea and sent them back to the palace. Those boats could travel both in the sea and the air. (Sūkta 116, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda, Anuvāka 17)."
