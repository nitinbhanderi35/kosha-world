In Vāmana Purāṇa, there is a story of how this sage once performed a homa and burnt Dhṛtarāṣṭra's kingdom in the sacrificial fire. <dvsn n='NI'/>Long ago some of the sages of Naimiśāraṇya approached Dhṛtarāṣṭra with a request for some money. Their leader was the sage Dālbhya (Baka). It was he who begged Dhṛtarāṣṭra for money. The king not only refused to give money, but also insulted the sage. Provoked at this, Dālbhya began performing a homa in which Dhṛtarāṣṭra's kingdom was the havis in the form of sliced meat. This homa was performed in Avakīrṇamahātīrtha at Pṛthūdaka. As a result of it the kingdom began to decline. The King was alarmed and consulted great scholars and astrologers about the cause of the country's decline. They told him that the cause of the disaster was Dālbhya's homa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra at once proceeded with rich presents to propitiate Dālbhya at Avakīrṇamahātīrtha. Dālbhya was pleased and as desired by the King, performed homa with milk and honey and revived all those who had died. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 39). <dvsn n='NI'/>Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11 says that this Mahaṛṣi flourished in Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. On another occasion, he is referred to, as coming to Dyumatsena, the father of Satyavān. At that time, he comforted Dyumatsena by saying that Satyavān would be blessed with longevity. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 298, Verse 17)."
