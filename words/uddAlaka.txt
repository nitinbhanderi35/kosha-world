To know how Āruṇi got the name Uddālaka, see under Āyodhadhaumya. <dvsn n='NI'/>It is stated in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 12 that this hermit Uddālaka was a prominent figure in the Durbar of Indra. Uddālaka had a son called Śvetaketu and a daughter called Sujātā. He gave his daughter Sujātā in marriage to his favourite disciple Kahoḍaka. The hermit Aṣṭāvakra was their son. See under Aṣṭāvakra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 132). Once Uddālaka caused the river Sarasvatī to appear at the place of sacrifice. From that day onwards Sarasvatī got the name ‘Manoramā’ because when the thought came to his mind (manas) the river made its appearance. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 33). It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 57, Stanza 10, that Uddālaka expelled his son Śvetaketu from the house because the son was a hater of Brahmins."

Once this hermit happened to forget that he had left flowers, food and his waterpot on the bank of the river and reaching his hermitage, he asked his son Nāciketa to fetch them from the bank of the river. When Nāciketa reached the bank of the river, those things had been washed down by the current. The son returned and reported the matter to his father. The father got angry and cursed his son to death. Seeing the son lying dead on darbha (mattress made of darbha grass) the hermit cried aloud. In that flow of tears life returned to the body and the son woke up as if from sleep. The father asked the son about the news of the realm of Yama (the god of death) and the son told the hermit the news about the world of the dead."
