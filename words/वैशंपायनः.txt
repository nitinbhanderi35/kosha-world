[It was he who made Yājñavalkya disgorge the whole of the Yajurveda he had learnt from him which was picked up by his other <lbinfo n='pu+pils'/> pupils in the form of <i>Tittiris</i> or partridges; and hence the Veda was called <lbinfo n='‘Tait+tirīya'/> ‘Taittirīya’. Vaiśampāyana was celebrated for his great skill in narrating Purāṇas, and is said to have recounted the whole of the Mahābhārata to king Janamejaya]."
