Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that one billion 660,020,000 men had fallen; and 24,165 had escaped; the fallen had all attained to regions like those of <i>Indra</i> (specifying those who had attained to G., Gh., <i>Brahmaloka</i>, and <i>Uttarakurus</i>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that in the forest he had obtained the gift of spiritual vision from D.-ṛ. <i>Lomaśa</i>. Urged by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> ordered <i>Sudharman</i>, etc. (α), to cause the funeral rites of the slain (β) to be duly performed; they burned them upon funeral pyres; the <i>Pitṛmedha</i>-rites were performed for some of the illustrious dead; by the noise of <i>sāmans</i>, <i>ṛcs</i>, and lamentations all creatures became stupefied that night. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> proceeded towards the <i>Gaṅgā</i> (XI, <b>26</b>). The <i>Kuru</i> ladies, etc., performed the water-rites for their fellow-kinsmen at the <i>Gaṅgā. Kuntī</i>, in a paroxysm of grief, disclosed the truth about <i>Karṇa's</i> birth (γ) to her sons. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> grieved, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> lamented, hearing that <i>Karṇa</i> was his elder brother (δ). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> caused <i>Karṇa's</i> wives, etc., to be brought before him, and with them performed the water-rite in honour of <i>Karṇa</i> (XI, <b>27</b>)."
