Smith takes it to be a mistake for Kuśasthalapura,<sup>278</sup> and identifies it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of Ānartta, i. e. North Gujarat.<sup>279</sup> Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with Kuśasthalī (Dwarka)<sup>280</sup> G. Ramdas locates the place in Gujarat following Smith.<sup>281</sup> Monier Williams also identifies Kuśasthala with the town of Dwarka.<sup>282</sup> Bhandarkar, following Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in North Arcot.<sup>283</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>This Kuśasthalī is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksiṇakosala.<sup>284</sup> It was the capital of Kuśa, son of Rāmacandra.<sup>285</sup> But its position in the list of the States of Dakṣiṇāpatha indicates a place a little more to the south. <dvsn n='P'/>By the process of Haplology,<sup>286</sup> Kuśasthalapura is simplified into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kuśasthalī or Kuśāvatī in short. <dvsn n='P'/>The suffix sthala or sthalī is significant: it suggests a highlying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed to a damp low-land.<sup>287</sup> The Mahābhārata, Harivaṃśa, early Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.<sup>288</sup> The Mahābhārata mentions both Kuśasthala as well as kuśa-sthalī. The latter is supposed to be another name of Dwarka.<sup>289</sup>"
