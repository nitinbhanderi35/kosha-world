It was a terrible clash between the Āryans who lived in Pañcanada and the primitive inhabitants of India, before the Ṛgveda period. Sudās, the king was the adversary of the Āryans. Among the relatives of Sudās were Āryans and non-Āryans. It was the people under Sudās who got victory in this war. Anyway, with this war, (Dāśarājña), a new mixed race of people came into being in North India, which was composed of the Āryans and the primitive inhabitants of the country. The Hindus are the descendants of this mixed race. (Ṛgveda)."
