(rarely pl. 1. 225. 12): Name of a missile related to god Vāyu 3. 164. 29; to Vāta 3. 161. 28; to Mātariśvan 4. 56. 14. <b>A.</b> Description: heavenly (<i>divya</i>) 5. 181. 13; 7. 132. 28; best (<i>uttama</i>) 1. 218. 15; very fierce (<i>sudāruṇa</i>) 6. 98. 20. <b>B.</b> Its knowledge: Arjuna learnt it from god Vāyu when he, after satisfying Mahādeva (Śiva), received it in the heaven along with many other heavenly weapons 1. 225. 12 (pl. <i>vāyavyāni</i>); 3. 164. 29; 3. 161. 28 (Vāta); 4. 56. 14 (Mātariśvan); 6. 116. 38; but apparently he had also learnt it earlier from Droṇa since he used it while displaying his skill in archery (1. 125. 19), and at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest (1. 218. 15); Droṇa, of course, knew it, and it was known to many other epic heroes, viz. Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman, Yudhiṣṭhira, and the Pāṇḍya king (see the next section); it was known also, perhaps, to Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 39. <b>C.</b> Use: (1) In the epic war: (i) by Arjuna, agaisnt the Trigartas; noticing its employment, Droṇa repelled it with the Śaila astra 6. 98. 18-20; against the Saṃśaptakas, to scatter their shower of arrows, when they covered Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna with their arrows; the two, therefore, could not be seen and were mistaken to be dead 7. 18. 17-22; god Vāyu carried away the Saṃśaptakas together with their horses, elephants, chariots and weapons like dried leaves; they looked like birds flying from trees 7. 18. 17-23; agaisnt Droṇa to repel the Vāyavyāstra released by him 7. 163. 28 (here not specifically named: <i>astṛāṇy astrair</i> <i>yadā tasya vidhivad dhanti pāṇḍavaḥ</i>); against Karṇa, to scatter the clouds created by his Vāruṇāstra 8. 67. 11; (ii) by Droṇa, against Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 28; again against Yudhiṣṭhira, when Droṇa was for a moment distressed by Yudhiṣṭhira's arrow and had to sit down in the chariot 7. 137. 40-42; against the army of king Drupada to blow it away, as wind blows away the clouds 7. 136. 10; 7. 132. 37; against Arjuna 7. 163. 28; (iii) by Yudhiṣṭhira, to combat successfully the same Astra used against him by Droṇa (<i>astram astreṇa jaghnivān</i>) 7. 132. 28; again to halt the same Astra used against him by Droṇa (<i>tad astram astreṇa</i> <i>raṇe stambhayām āsa</i>) 7. 137. 42; (iv) by Aśvatthāman, against Ghaṭotkaca to blow him away (<i>vyadhamat</i>) when Ghaṭotkaca employed his <i>māyā</i> to become a dark cloud to attack Aśvatthāman 7. 131. 71-72; (v) by Karṇa, against Ghaṭotkaca under similar conditions 7. 150. 70-71; (vi) by the Pāṇḍya king, to obstruct (<i>rudh-</i>) the shower of arrows released by Aśvatthāman on his army 8. 15. 30-31; (2) Outside the epic war—(i) Arjuna used it by reciting <i>mantras (abhimantrya)</i> to dispel the clouds and the lightning created by Vāyu and Indra at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest 1. 218. 15; Arjuna used it against Kirāta (Śiva), but the missile had no effect on him 3. 163. 29-30; against Droṇa at the time of the cattle-raid to swallow the Vāyavyāstra used by Droṇa (<i>vāyavyaṃ … </i> <i>astram astreṇa pāṇḍavaḥ / … grasate</i> <i>sma … </i>) 4. 53. 48; against Bhīṣma at the time of the cattle raid 4. 59. 21; at the time of displaying his skill in the use of missiles 1. 125. 19; (ii) by Bhīṣma, against Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 59. 21; against Rāma Jāmadagnya who combated it with the use of the Guhyakāstra 5. 181. 11; (iii) by Droṇa, against Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 53. 48; (iv) the effect of the Vāyavyāstra was produced by the Nivātakavaca demons by employing their <i>māyā</i> while fighting with Arjuna; it produced wind, the velocity of which was obstructed by Arjuna by the use of the Śaila astra (<i>śailena ca mahāstreṇa vāyor vegam</i> <i>adhārayam</i>) 3. 168. 9-10; the demons again practised their different <i>māyās</i> simultaneously (<i>prākurvan vividhā māyā yaugapadyena</i>) and produced the Astra of Vāyu (along with that of Agni and the Aśmavarṣa); it oppressed Arjuna and produced darkness all around, which was dispelled by Arjuna by employing his Astramāyā 3. 168. 11-13, 25-26. <b>D.</b> Effects: Arjuna created wind by the use of the Vāyavya astra (<i>vāyavyenāsṛjad vāyum</i>) 1. 125. 19; the wind that was released by the use of the missile agitated the sky, felled the trees, and killed soldiers 6. 98. 18-20; when used against the Saṃśaptakas, god Vāyu (<i>bhagavān</i> <i>vāyuḥ</i>) swept them away together with their horses, elephants, chariots and weapons, like dried leaves; they appeared like birds flying away from trees 7. 18. 22-23.
