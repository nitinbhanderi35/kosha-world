The second part is <i>kārddava.<sup>56</sup></i> It is the name of some Nāgas or serpent-demons thought to be inhabitants of the lower regions.<sup>57</sup> Kadru is the name of the mother of serpents. Kādrava by metathesis becomes Kārddava which literally means ‘born of Kadru’. In south, among aboriginal people and lower castes, the practice of matriarchal names is well known. The whole term ‘Āmrakārddava’ is inexplicable as one word. Āmra seems to be his personal name and Kārddava his family title."
