But the Caṇḍālas who were impressed by Kāyavya's moral conduct, made him the headman of the village. He taught others that all people should honour Brāhmaṇas and love their country. His political creed was that those who prospered by the ruin of a country were just like the worms living on a dead body. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 135)."
