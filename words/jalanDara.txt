Once he met with the headless Rāhu, who said to Jalandhara, the whole story beginning from the churning of the sea of Milk. Jalandhara, became furious at the gods who had churned his grandfather. So he collected a big army of asuras and went to war with the devas. Though a large number of Asuras were killed in the battle, Indra and Viṣṇu were defeated and Viṣṇu was taken captive and hidden under the sea. Finally Paramaśiva went to fight with the Asura. In the fight Jalandhara was killed and Viṣṇu was rescued. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapters 3 to 5). For further details see under Māyāśiva."
