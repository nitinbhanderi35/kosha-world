            "content": "<b>Aṣṭāvakrīya(ṃ)</b>¦ (“episode relating to Aṣṭāvakra”). —§ 51 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, <b>2</b>, 449: <i>A. atraiva vivādo yatra</i> <i>Bandinā</i>, etc.—§ 412 (Tīrthay.): III, <b>132</b> ff.: <i>Uddālaka</i> gave his own daughter <i>Sujātā</i> in marriage, together with sacred learning (<i>śrutaṃ</i>), to his disciple the brahman <i>Kahoda</i>, who had served him long. The embryo in her womb had become versed in the <i>Śāstras</i> and the <i>Vedas</i> with the <i>aṅgas</i>, and blamed <i>Kahoda</i>, who had been reading the whole night. The great <i>ṛṣi Kahoda</i> cursed him to become crooked on eight parts of his body, wherefore he, when born, was called <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i>. In order to procure wealth for <i>Sujātā</i>, <i>Kahoda</i> went to king <i>Janaka</i> (son of <i>Indradyumna</i>, v. <b>133</b>, 10624), where he was defeated in a controversy with the <i>sūta</i> (v. 10613, etc., <i>sūtaputram</i> v. 10671) <i>Bandin</i> and was immersed into water. <i>Uddālaka</i> prevailed upon <i>Sujātā</i> to keep it a secret from <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i>, who regarded <i>Uddālaka</i> as his father and <i>Śvetaketu</i>, the son of <i>Uddālaka</i>, who was of the same age with himself, as his brother, until in his 12th year <i>Śvetaketu</i> in anger happened to disclose the matter to him. He and <i>Śvetaketu</i> then went to the sacrifice of <i>Janaka</i>, and on being driven from the entrance <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i> met the king (III, <b>132</b>), and in the course of a conversation with him and the doorkeeper he compared <i>Janaka</i> to <i>Yayāti</i>, and said that he had heard that <i>Bandin</i> caused those whom he had vanquished in disputation to be drowned in the sea by men sent by <i>Janaka</i>, and he declared that he had come to maintain the unity with <i>Bráhman (Brahmādvaitam</i>) and to defeat <i>Bandin</i>; then he answered several enigmatical questions (about the wheel of Time, the thunder and lightning, the fish, egg, stone, and river) and was admitted (III, <b>133</b>). Here they disputed in such a way that <i>Bandin</i> enumerated things of which there is only 1 (fire, Sun, <i>Indra</i>, and <i>Yama</i>), <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i> groups of 2 (<i>Indra</i> and <i>Agni</i>, 2 devarṣis: <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Parvata</i>, 2 <i>Aśvins</i>, 2 wheels of a chariot; husband and wife), <i>Ba°</i> of 3 (3 times the creatures are born, etc.; see Nīl.), <i>A°</i> of 4 (4 are the <i>āśramas</i> of the <i>brahmans</i>; 4 orders perform this sacrifice(!), etc.), <i>Ba°</i> of 5 (5 fires, etc.), <i>A°</i> of 6 (6 cows, it is asserted by some, are the <i>dakṣiṇā</i> for establishing the sacred fire, <i>“ādhāne,”</i> etc.), <i>Ba°</i> of 7 (7 domesticated animals, 7 wild animals, etc.), <i>A°</i> of 8 (8 <i>śāṇas</i> make a <i>śatamāna</i>, see BR., 8 are the legs of the <i>śarabha</i>, etc.), <i>Ba°</i> of 9 (9 are the <i>sāmidhenī</i> verses for the <i>Pitṛs</i>, etc.), <i>A°</i> of 10 (10 are the cardinal points, etc.), <i>Ba°</i> of 11 (11 are the <i>ekādaśinas</i> of the creatures, see Nīl., 11 are there the <i>yūpas</i>, etc.), <i>A°</i> of 12 (12 months, etc.). As <i>Bandin</i> had said the first half-<i>śloka</i> with 13 (the 13th <i>tithi</i> is deemed most auspicious, 13 are the islands of the earth), he stopped, and <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i> fulfilled the <i>śloka. Bandin</i> was then deemed to be vanquished, and at the request of <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i> he merged into the sea, after he had declared himself to be the son of <i>Varuṇa</i> and that he had caused the <i>brahmans</i> to be drowned in order that they might see the twelve years <i>sattra</i> of <i>Varuṇa</i> that was performed simultaneously with that of <i>Janaka</i>. They at once reappeared, and <i>Kahoda</i> let <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i> bathe in the river <i>Samaṅgā</i>, and all his limbs were immediately made straight, and the <i>Samaṅgā</i> became a remover of sin. “Therefore you also should bathe there” (III, <b>134</b>)."
