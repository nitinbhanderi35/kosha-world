It is seen in the Kathāsaritsāgara where a Vidyādhara woman tells the story of Alaṅkāravatī to the King. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once a vidyādhara named Alaṅkāraśīla ruled over a city called Śrī Sundarapura in the Himālayas. His wife was called Kāñcanaprabhā. A son was born to them. They named him Dharmaśīla because Devī Kātyāyanī told them in a dream that the son would become Dharmapara (who performs duties well). To the prince, knowledge in every branch of studies was imparted and then he was anointed heir to the throne. He executed regal functions to perfection and ruled his subjects better than his father. Kāñcanaprabhā, wife of Alaṅkāraśīla, gave birth to a daughter. At the time of her birth a heavenly voice said that she would become the wife of Naravāhanadatta the emperor of the Vidyādharas. They named her Alaṅkāravatī. She grew into a very beautiful maiden. She learned arts and sciences from her father. She went on a pilgrimage to the Śiva temples far and wide. One day she heard a celestial voice: “Go to the Svayambhu temple in Kaśmīra and worship there and you will get as your husband Naravāhanadatta.” Finally Naravāhanadatta the emperor of Vidyādharas married her. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lambaka 9, Taraṅga 1)."
