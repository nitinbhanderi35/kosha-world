            "content": "COLA¦. A very righteous emperor of Kāñcīpura. Because of the virtuous rule of this emperor his country got the name Cola. There is an interesting story in Padma Purāṇa of how the emperor attained Vaikuṇṭhaloka (The abode of Mahāviṣṇu). <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Cola went to Vaikuṇṭha to worship Mahāviṣṇu. As he was worshipping him with pearls and flowers of gold a brahmin subject of his came there to worship him with water and Tulasī leaves. The simple offering of Tulasī leaves and flowers by this brahmaṛṣi, Viṣṇudāsa, eclipsed the expensive one by the King and the latter was greatly offended and he rebuked the Brahmin saying that he was a poor man who did not know what devotion to Viṣṇu was. But Viṣṇudāsa did not take the taunt unchallenged. He asked the king to wait and see who would merge with the glowing entity of the Lord earlier. <dvsn n='NI'/>The King on returning to his palace started a Vaiṣṇavasattra. (An almonry dedicated to Mahāviṣṇu). This almshouse was as comfortable and luxurious as the one once started by Brahmā in the temple of Gaya. Viṣṇudāsa on the other hand spent his life in a Viṣṇu temple leading a celibate life and observing rites pleasing to Viṣṇu. <dvsn n='NI'/>One day after finishing his daily morning rites Viṣṇudāsa cooked his food as usual and kept it in its place to be taken later. But on returning to it after some time he found his food eaten by someone else. He went without food that day and it happened the next day also. It continued to happen thus for a week and all these days Viṣṇudāsa went fasting. Viṣṇudāsa then decided to watch and see who the thief was. On keeping a vigil he found a Caṇḍāla (a harijan of the lowest Cadre) timidly coming and grabbing at the food with gluttonous greed to appease his hunger. Seeing the famished skeletonous body of the thief Viṣṇudāsa felt compassion rather than resentment and calling him back to take the food went after him crying “Hi, come here and take this ghee also with you. That food has no fat in it.” But the Gaṇḍāla frightened at the sight of the owner of the food ran away as fast as his legs could carry him, Viṣṇudāsa following him. But soon the Caṇḍāla fell fainting on the road exhausted and tired. Viṣṇudāsa reaching his side started fanning him with his cloth. Very soon the Caṇḍāla changed himself into Mahāviṣṇu adorned with Śaṃkha, Cakra and Gadā and Viṣṇu embracing his devotee took him to Vaikuṇṭha. <dvsn n='NI'/>Hearing this Cola called Mudgala the priest of the Vaiṣṇavasattra, to his side and lamented “I started this sattra to spite Viṣṇudāsa and now he has gone to Vaikuṇṭha. It was due to his true devotion to God that he has attained salvation. What we have done is of no use.” So saying he crowned his nephew as King. Even while young he had become an ascetic and as such had no sons. From that time the crowning of the nephew as King became a precedent in Cola. Renouncing the kingdom Cola went to the sacrificial hall and circling the sacrificial fire stood before it and addressing Mukunda said “Oh Viṣṇu, grant me unwavering devotion to you in thought, speech and deed.” Repeating this three times the king jumped into the fire. At this Mudgala, the priest, burst into anger and tore off the lock of hair on his head. So even today the descendants of Mudgala do not have hair-locks. Viṣṇu who is always affectionate to his devotees graciously appeared from the sacrificial fire and embraced the King. The King was then taken to Vaikuṇṭha. (Chapters 110, 111, Padma Purāṇa)."
