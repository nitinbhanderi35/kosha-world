A kṣetra sacred to Paraśurāma: Nine pools of blood were made here by Paraśurāma after killing all the Kṣatriyas of the earth twenty-one times. Here came Kṛṣṇa and the Yadus to observe solar eclipse. After fasting and bathing, Brahmans and other guests were fed. Thither came Nanda and the Gopas as well as Bhīṣma, Droṇa and other sages and kings. All of them exchanged greetings. Draupadī spent her time with Kṛṣṇa's wives asking them about their marriages. Here Kṛṣṇa and Vasudeva performed a sacrifice. A <i>tīrtha</i> on the banks of the Sarasvatī where Ditī engaged herself in penance. <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. IX. 16. 19; X. 78 [95 (V) 19]; chh. 82, 83 and 84 (whole). M. 7. 3."
