Śānti Parva, Chapter 90). He married Soma's daughter Bhadrā. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 154, Verse 12). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Utathya drank up the sea dry.</i> Varuṇa deva had an eye on Soma's daughter Bhadrā when Utathya married her. Incensed at the marriage, Varuṇa carried Bhadrā off to the sea one day when Utathya was not present. Nārada informed Utathya that it was Varuṇa who stole his wife. Though Nārada, at the request of Utathya, asked Varuṇa to return Bhadrā to the former he did not oblige. Enraged at this Utathya drank up the sea dry. Yet, Varuṇa did not come round. Then Utathya rendered all the lakes of Varuṇa dry. Trembling at this Varuṇa returned Bhadrā to Utathya and prostrated at his feet. He pardoned Varuṇa and gave back the sea to him. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 154)."
