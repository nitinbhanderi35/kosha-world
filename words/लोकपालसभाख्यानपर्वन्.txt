Lokapālasabhākhyāna.)—§ 265: While the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were sitting in that palace, with the great <i>Gandharvas</i>, there came unto them the <i>devarṣi Nārada</i> (his accomplishments are enumerated at great length), having wandered over the different worlds, accompanied by the <i>ṛṣis Pārijāta, Raivata</i>, <i>Sumukta</i>, and <i>Saumya. Nārada</i> informed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> about religion, pleasure, and profit, in the form of questions about his conduct. By following his advice <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> conquered the whole earth (II, <b>5</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> answered that he observed all those rules. Then he asked <i>Nārada</i> if he had ever seen a palace like his. <i>Nārada</i> (<i>Brahmaṛṣiḥ</i>, v. 281) replied that no palace among men was like his, but that he would describe unto him the palaces of <i>Pitṛrāja</i> (i.e. <i>Yama</i>), <i>Varuṇa, Indra</i>, the dweller on <i>Kailāsa</i> (i.e. <i>Kubera</i>), and <i>Brahmán</i>, always worshipped by gods, <i>Pitṛs</i> and <i>Sādhyas</i>, etc. (II, <b>6</b>).—§ 266: <i>Śakrasabhāvarṇana</i> (q.v.).—§ 267: <i>Yama-</i> <i>sabhāvarṇana</i> (q.v.).—§ 268: <i>Varuṇasabhāvarṇana</i> (q.v.).— § 269: <i>Vaiśravaṇasabhāvarṇana</i> (q.v.).—§ 270: <i>Brahma-</i> <i>sabhāvarṇana</i> (q.v.).—§ 271: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said: It appears that almost all the monarchs are in the sabhā of <i>Yama</i>—the <i>Nāgas, Daityas</i>, rivers, and oceans in that of <i>Varuṇa</i>—the <i>Yakṣas, Guhyakas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Apsarases</i>, and <i>Śiva</i> in that of <i>Kubera</i>—the great <i>ṛṣis</i>, and gods, and <i>śāstras</i> in that of <i>Pitāmaha</i> (i.e. <i>Brahmán</i>); and in that of <i>Śakra</i> (i.e. <i>Indra</i>) gods, <i>Gandharvas</i> and various <i>ṛṣis</i>, but only one king, the <i>rājarṣi Hariścandra (b</i>); this is explained by <i>Nārada. Pāṇḍu</i>, beholding the good fortune of <i>Hariścandra</i>, had asked <i>Nārada</i> to tell <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to subjugate the whole earth and then perform a <i>rājasūya</i>. Thereby also <i>Pāṇḍu</i> and his ancestors would go to the region of <i>Indra</i>. <i>Brahmarakṣases</i>, that destroy the sacrifices, always look for opportunities of obstructing it. Then <i>Nārada</i> went away to the city of the <i>Dāśārhas</i>, accompanied by the <i>ṛṣis</i> with whom he had come (II, <b>12</b>)."
