The only work of his which has come to light is Śiśupālavadha known popularly as Māgha. <Poem>Upamā Kālidāsasya Bhāraverarthagauravam / Daṇḍinaḥ padalālityaṃ Māghe santi trayo guṇāḥ //</Poem> <dvsn n='NI'/>This is a very famous verse meaning thus: “The simile of Kālidāsa, the depth of meaning of the words of Bhāravi and the simplicity of language of Daṇḍin are all present in Māgha”. This indicates how great a poet Māgha was. <dvsn n='NI'/>From the last part of this Kāvya it can be surmised that Māgha was the son of Dattaka and grandson of Suprabhadeva. Suprabhadeva was the minister of a King called Dharmadeva. Māgha was born in Gujarat. A literary critic named Jacobi fixes the period of Māgha as the 6th century A.D. while others fix it as the 8th century A.D Māgha has made references to the drama ‘Nāgānanda’ written by Harṣa. Harṣa was a King during the period 606 to 649 and that is why the period of Māgha is fixed after that period."
