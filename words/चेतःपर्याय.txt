In <ls>Bhīk</ls> 〔27a.5〕 cetaḥparyāyasya is not preceded by para- or equivalent, but the meaning is certainly the same, since other abhijñā precede and follow it (divyasya śrotrasya, pūrvanivāsasya). In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.321.13〕 Buddhas are called cetaḥparyāyasaṃpannāḥ, probably also with implication of para-, <ab>tho</ab> here most of the other abhijñā are not listed; but the next following epithet is ṛddhiprātihāryasaṃpannā(ḥ), which recalls one of them."
