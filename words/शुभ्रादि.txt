            "content": "a class of words headed by the word शुभ्र to which the taddhita affix एय (ढक्) is added in the sense of a descendant in spite of other affixes being prescribed by some other rules which sometimes are added optionally with this एय; e.g. शौभ्रयः, वैधवेयः रौहिणेयः. This class is looked upon as आकृतिगण and hence if this affix एय is seen applied although not prescribed actually as in the word गाङ्गेय, the word is supposed to have been included in this class; cf. P. IV. 1.123."
