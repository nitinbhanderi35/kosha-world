The following story about his birth is told in the Padma Purāṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>Though married for a long time Pauṣya did not have an issue. He began worshipping Śiva to be blessed with a son. Śiva was pleased at this and he gave him a fruit which he divided equally among his three wives. In due course the three wives delivered. But, to get the full and complete form of a child the three children had to be joined together, and so the parts were unified. This boy was Candraśekhara. Thus Candraśekhara acquired the name Tryaṃbaka. <dvsn n='NI'/>Candraśekhara married Tārāvatī, daughter of Kakutstha, a King of the solar dynasty. On account of the curse of Kapotamuni two sons, Bhṛṅgi and Mahākāla were born to Tārāvatī in Vetāla yoni and Bhairava yoni respectively. Dama, Uparicara and Alarka were sons born to Candraśekhara himself. (Aurasaputras)."
