While his father is called a <i>śreṣṭhin</i> he was not <i>śreṣṭhin</i> or banker by profession. The word <i>grāmika</i> affixed to Vargga's name suggests that he was the headman of a village which seems to be no other than Avaḍāra. Vargga literally means one who excludes or removes or averts’.<sup>7</sup>"
