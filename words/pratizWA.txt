According to Agni Purāṇa it is the installation of Śivaliṅga that is called Pratiṣṭhā. <dvsn n='NI'/>Pīṭha is Śakti (Power) and Liṅga is Śiva. It is the union of Śakti in the form of Pīṭha and Śiva in the form of liṅga that is called Pratiṣṭhā. This Pratiṣṭhā is attained by means of Śivamantras. There are five different kinds of Pratiṣṭhās:— <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Viśeṣapratiṣṭhā.</i> Any pratiṣṭhā in which Brahmaśilā is used in combination is called Viśeṣapratiṣṭhā. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Sthāpana.</i> Fixing the liṅga on the pīṭha (platform) is called Sthāpana. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Sthitasthāpana.</i> The fixing of the liṅga (idol) on the pīṭha (platform) when the liṅga gets shaky on it is called Sthitasthāpana. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Utthāpana.</i> Taking the idol out from the platform and refixing it, is called Utthāpana. <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Āsthāpana.</i> A pratiṣṭhā in which after the fixation learned priests conduct purification ceremonies, is called Āsthāpana."
