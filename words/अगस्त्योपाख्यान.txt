Thus they killed many brahmans. Meanwhile <i>Agastya</i> saw his ancestors hanging in a hole with the heads downwards, and was asked by them to procure offspring to them. As he did not see any wife worthy of himself, he selected the most beautiful parts from various creatures and created an excellent woman, whom he caused to be born as the daughter of the <i>Vidarbha</i> king, who was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining offspring. She was named <i>Lopāmudrā</i>, and was very beautiful. When she attained to puberty no one dared to ask for her hand (III, <b>96</b>). When <i>Agastya</i> asked the <i>Vidarbha</i> king to bestow her upon him, the king and his queen became much afflicted, but at her own request <i>Lopāmudrā</i> was bestowed upon <i>Agastya</i>, who immediately asked her to discard her ornaments and dress herself in rags and barks and deer-skins and partake of his vows, and proceeding to <i>Gaṅgādvāra</i> they practised the severest penances. When at last he summoned her for marital intercourse she made it a condition that he should approach her on a bed like to that which she had in the palace of her father, and that both should be adorned with costly ornaments, and she told him to procure these things without impairing his ascetic merit (III, <b>97</b>). <i>Agastya</i> then went to King <i>Śrutarvan</i> and asked him for wealth, but seeing that his expenditure was equal to his income, he took nothing, but, together with <i>Śrutarvan</i>, went to King <i>Bradhnaśva</i>, with the same result; then all three went to King <i>Trasadasyu Paurukutsa</i> of the line of <i>Ikṣvāku</i>, with the same result. At the suggestion of the three kings they all four went to <i>Ilvala</i> (III, <b>98</b>). <i>Ilvala</i> went out with his ministers to receive them on the confines of his domain. He prepared the flesh of <i>Vātāpi</i> in order to entertain them, at which the kings became sad, but <i>Agastya</i> ate it all, and when <i>Ilvala</i> summoned <i>Vātāpi</i> there came only air out of <i>Agastya's</i> stomach, <i>Vātāpi</i> having already been digested. Then <i>Ilvala</i>, becoming sad, promised to give them wealth if <i>Agastya</i> could tell him what he intended to give, and <i>Agastya</i> rightly said that he intended to give each of the kings 10,000 cows and as many gold coins, and to <i>Agastya</i> twice as much, and a car that would be found to be a golden one, with two steeds (<i>Virāva</i> and <i>Surāva</i>). The car brought <i>Agastya</i> and the kings to <i>Agastya's</i> hermitage within the twinkling of an eye. Then the <i>rājarṣis</i> went away to their cities. When <i>Agastya</i> proposed to <i>Lopāmudrā</i> to choose between 1000 sons, or 100 each equal to 10, or 10 each equal to 100, or 1 equal to 1000, she chose the last alternative. After she had conceived he retired into the forest. After seven years she gave birth to <i>Drḍhasyu</i>, who came out as if repeating the <i>Vedas</i> with the <i>Upaniṣads</i> and <i>Aṅgas</i>; and from carrying, while yet a child, loads of sacrificial fuel to the hermitage of his father, he was called <i>Idhmavāha. Agastya</i> was highly pleased, and his ancestors obtained the <i>lokas</i> they desired.—§ 384: In the <is>kṛta age</is> the <i>Dānava</i> tribes named <i>Kālakeyas</i> under <i>Vṛtra</i> pursued the gods under <i>Indra</i>. The gods, on the suggestion of Brahmán, with <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> at their head, proceeded to the hermitage of the ṛṣi <i>Dadhīca</i> on the other bank of <i>Sarasvatī</i>, and having prevailed upon him to leave his body, they caused <i>Tvaṣṭṛ</i> to construct of his bones the six-sided (<i>ṣaḍaśri) vajra</i> which <i>Tvaṣṭṛ</i> handed to <i>Indra</i> that he might slay <i>Vṛtra</i> with it (III, <b>100</b>). In the encounter that ensued between the gods and the <i>Kālakeyas</i> the gods were defeated, until <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, the gods, and the <i>brahmarṣis</i> had transferred their own vigour to <i>Indra</i>. He then hurled the <i>vajra</i> against <i>Vṛtra</i> and slew him so that he fell headlong like the <i>Mandara</i> mountain hurled of yore from <i>Viṣṇu's</i> hand; but <i>Indra</i> fled in fear, desiring to take shelter in a lake, thinking that the <i>vajra</i> had not been hurled from his hand and that <i>Vṛtra</i> was still alive, while the gods defeated the <i>Dānavas</i>, who fled to the depths of the sea. Here they conspired for the destruction of the three worlds, and resolved upon destroying all who were possessed of ascetic virtues (<i>tapas</i>), for so the universe would itself be destroyed, as it is supported by asceticism (III, <b>101</b>). Remaining in the depths of the sea by day, the <i>Kāleyas</i> during the night slew the <i>munis</i> in the hermitages and sacred spots (<i>puṇyeṣvāyataneṣu</i>); in the hermitage of <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, 197 ascetics; in that of <i>Cyavana</i>, 100; in that of <i>Bharadvāja</i>, 20, without being seen; every morning people saw the dead bodies and mutilated limbs of the <i>munis</i> and the disturbed <i>agnihotras</i> scattered on the ground. Men fled for their lives into all directions or killed themselves from fear. Some brave bowmen searched in vain for the evildoers. The gods with <i>Indra</i> repaired to <i>Nārāyaṇa (c</i>) (III, <b>102</b>). They did not know by whom the <i>brahmans</i> were being killed during the night. <i>Viṣṇu</i> explained the whole affair to them, and told them to apply to <i>Agastya (Maitrāvaruṇi</i>) that he might dry up the sea, as no one else was capable of so doing. They then went to the hermitage of <i>Agastya</i>, and mentioned to him that he had delivered the gods from <i>Nahuṣa</i> and caused <i>Vindhya</i> to cease to increase in height (in competition with the Sun), the world having been covered with darkness (III, <b>103</b>).—§ 385: <i>Vindhya</i> (q.v.).—§ 386: At the request of the gods <i>Agastya</i>, accompanied by <i>ṛṣis</i>, gods, men, <i>Uragas</i> (snakes), <i>Gandharvas, Yakṣas</i>, and <i>Kimpuruṣas</i>, approached the ocean (III, <b>104</b>) and drank it up, to the amazement of the gods, who called him <i>Vidhātṛ</i> and the creator of the worlds, while the musical instruments of <i>Gandharvas</i> were playing, and celestial blossoms were showered upon him. The <i>Kāleyas</i>, who had previously been burnt by the <i>tapas</i> of the <i>munis</i>, were now destroyed by the gods, except some few who, rending asunder the goddess Earth, sought refuge in <i>Pātāla</i>. The gods now asked <i>Agastya</i> to fill up the ocean again, but he had already digested the water. The gods with <i>Viṣṇu</i> came to <i>Brahmán</i> and spoke to him about replenishing the sea (III, <b>105</b>). <i>Brahmán</i> dismissed them, saying that only after a long course of time the ocean would be brought to resume its wonted state by the agnates of king <i>Bhagīratha</i>."
