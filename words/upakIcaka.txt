Kīcaka and the Upakīcakas were born of a portion of Kālakeya an asura. At the palace of Virāṭa, Kīcaka harassed Pāñcālī and was killed in the night by Bhīma. (See under Kīcaka). Hearing about the death of Kīcaka, the hundred and five Upakīcakas came there and decided to burn Pāñcālī also, because they thought she was the cause of the death of their elder brother. They bound and carried her to the cremation ground. Hearing her loud cry, Bhīma jumped over the wall and ran to the cremation ground. He uprooted a tree, killed all the hundred and five Upakīcakas and brought Pāñcālī to the palace. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 23)."
