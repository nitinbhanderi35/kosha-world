But the occasion is the approach to his enlightenment (not his conception or birth), which is signalized by miracles and cosmic portents. The <ab>mss.</ab> read °bhāvanām, which is doubtless right: <i>they recognize on all sides that the Bodhisattvaʼs self-realization</i> (ātma-bhāvanā) <i>is at hand</i>.]"
