The last time of his exile he passed in <i>Puṣkara</i>. After the twelve years were complete he came back to <i>Khāṇḍavaprastha</i>. <i>Draupadī</i> at first was jealous, but then embraced <i>Subhadrā</i>. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> visited them at <i>Indraprastha</i> with <i>Rāma, Akrūra</i> <i>Dānapati</i> (the <i>senāpati</i> of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>), <i>Anādhṛṣṭi, Uddhava</i> (a disciple of <i>Bṛhaspati</i> himself), <i>Satyaka</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i>, and <i>Kṛtavarman Sātvata</i>, and <i>Pradyumna, Śāmba, Niśaṭha, Śaṅku</i>, <i>Cārudeṣṇa, Jhillin, Vipṛthu, Sāraṇa, Gada</i>, etc., bringing with them many nuptial presents. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sent the twins out to receive them. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> gave them 10,000 kine from the country of <i>Mathurā</i>, and <i>Bālhika</i> horses as <i>kanyādhana</i>, etc. <i>Rāma</i> gave <i>Arjuna</i> as a wedding present (<i>pāṇigrahaṇika</i>) 1,000 elephants. Having spent many days in sports and merriment there, the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> returned to <i>Dvāravatī</i> with <i>Rāma</i> in the van, carrying with them the gems that had been given them by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. But <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> remained with <i>Arjuna</i> at <i>Indrapraṣtha</i>, and they went a-hunting over the borders of the <i>Yamunā. Subhadrā</i> brought forth <i>Abhimanyu</i>, so called because he was fearless (<i>abhī</i>) and wrathful (<i>manyumat</i>, v. 8027). Upon his birth <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> gave away 10,000 kine and <i>niṣkas</i> to the <i>brahmans</i>. The child became the favourite of <i>Vāsudeva</i>, etc., and acquired from his father the <i>Dhanurveda (b).—Pāñcalī</i> (<i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, v. 8045) also obtained five sons (see § 159): <i>Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Śrutakarman</i>, <i>Śatānīka, Śrutasena</i>. They were born each at the interval of one year. Their <i>jātakarman, cūḍa</i>, and <i>upanayana</i> were performed by <i>Dhaumya</i>. After having studied the <i>Vedas</i> they acquired from <i>Arjuna</i> knowledge of all weapons celestial and human (I, <b>221</b>)."
