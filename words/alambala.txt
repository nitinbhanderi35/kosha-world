This asura (Alambala) fought on the side of the Kauravas in the Kurukṣetra battle because Bhīmasena had killed his father, Jaṭāsura. In the battle, Ghaṭotkaca cut off the head of this mighty warrior and magician and threw his head into the war-chariot of Duryodhana. (M.B., Droṇa Parva, Chapter 149)."
