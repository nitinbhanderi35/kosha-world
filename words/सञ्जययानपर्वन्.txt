Sañjayayāna). § 556: <i>Drupada's purohita</i> was honoured by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Vidura</i>. He mentioned the eternal duties of kings; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had not obtained their share of the paternal wealth; the murderous contrivances of the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>; the deceitful game; the indignities in the council-hall; the exile for thirteen years; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> desired nothing but a peaceful settlement; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were more powerful; men like <i>Sātyaki, Bhīmasena</i>, and the twins were equal in might to 1,000 <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i>; <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> nobody could fight (V, <b>20</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> approved of his speech; but <i>Karṇa</i> wrathfully interrupted him. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> pacified <i>Bhīṣma</i>, rebuked <i>Karṇa</i>, sent <i>Drupada's purohita</i> back to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and summoned <i>Sañjaya</i> to the council-hall (V, <b>21</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> gave instructions to <i>Sañjaya</i>, praising the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (α) and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and some of their adherents (β), mentioning the killing of <i>Śiśupāla (b</i>), blaming <i>Duryodhana</i>, and <i>Karṇa</i>, and ordered him to go to <i>Upaplavya</i> to salute them and the five sons of <i>Draupadī</i>, and tell them that <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was desirous of peace with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (V, <b>22</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> came to <i>Upaplavya</i> and saluted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and enquired about <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (γ). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra</i>, etc. (δ), and mentioned the prowess of <i>Arjuna (c</i>), <i>Sahadeva (d), Nakula (e</i>), and the <i>Ghoṣayātrā</i> (V, <b>23</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> delivered his message and answered <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> questions (V, <b>24</b>). In the presence of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ε), <i>Sañjaya</i> greeted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ζ), and recommended peace, “for what, in sooth, is life after having killed all your kinsfolk?”; he mentioned <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (η) on the side of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (θ), on the side of the <i>Kauravas</i> (V, <b>25</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that peace was preferable to war, but complained that <i>Duryodhana</i> had disregarded the words of <i>Vidura</i>, and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> had been desirous solely of satisfying his sons; that <i>Duryodhana's</i> counsellors were now <i>Duḥśāsana, Śakuni</i>, and <i>Karṇa</i>. He compared <i>Arjuna, Bhīma, Nakula</i>, and <i>Sahadeva</i> with <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i>. He claimed <i>Indraprastha</i> for his kingdom (V, <b>26</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> declared that if, without war, the <i>Kurus</i> would not yield his share to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, then it would be far better for him to live upon alms in the kingdom of the <i>Andhakas</i> and the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> than to obtain sovereignty by war (V, <b>27</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that virtue and vice, which are both eternal and absolute, exchange their aspects during seasons of distress; he would not seek even what belongs to <i>Prajāpati</i>, or heaven, or <i>Brahmaloka (Prājāpatyaṃ tridivaṃ</i> <i>Brahmalokaṃ</i>) by unrighteous means; but he would be guided by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, as did <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ι); <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was the great judge of the propriety or otherwise of all acts (V, <b>28</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said he wished prosperity for both the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>; therefore he desired peace; but when <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and his sons were so covetous, war was inevitable; “some say that work should be shunned and that salvation is attainable by knowledge; but the brahmans know this, that though one may have a knowledge of eatable things, yet the hunger will not be appeased unless one actually eats; such branches of knowledge as are of use in doing works bear fruit, but not the other ones. In the other world it is by virtue of work that the gods, etc. (κ) flourish. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> is constantly engaged in the study of the <i>Veda</i>; he is bent on the horse-sacrifice and the <i>rājasūya</i>; he rides horses and elephants, etc.; if the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> could see a course of action not involving the slaughter of the sons of <i>Kuru</i>, they would adopt it. But we must take into consideration the division into four castes and the respective duties allotted to each (specification). War and weapons were invented by <i>Indra</i> for putting the <i>Dasyus</i> to death.” <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> alluded to the game and the role of <i>Śakuni</i> there, to the indignities undergone by <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> from <i>Duḥśāsana</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>, while the <i>Kurus</i> with <i>Bhīṣma</i> at their head did not interfere, and only <i>Vidura</i> took her part; and that <i>Duḥśāsana</i> had called the <i>Pāṇḍaras</i> eunuchs at their departure. He would go in person to the <i>Kurus</i>. He compared the evil passions of <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (λ), with the righteousness of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (μ). “King <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> with his sons constitute a forest, while the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> are its tigers; do not cut down the forest with its tigers, and let not the tigers be driven away from the forest; the tiger out of the wood is easily slain; the wood also that is without a tiger is easily cut down.” Similarly the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> are as creepers, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> are <i>Śāla-</i> trees, and the creepers cannot dispense with a large tree round which it can twine (V, <b>29</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> then bade farewell to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ν). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> spoke approvingly of <i>Sañjaya's</i> agreeable speech and excellent conduct as an ambassador, and compared him to <i>Vidura</i>, and declared him to be as dear to them as <i>Dhanañjaya</i> (i.e. Arjuna). He recommended the <i>brahmans</i> to him, and told him to salute <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ξ), and the aged, middle-aged, and young ladies, “the daughters of our house,” and the maidservants and manservants, and the many humpbacked and lame ones among them, and those that were defective in limb, or imbecile, and the dwarfs to whom <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> gave food and raiment from motives of humanity, the blind, the aged, the many that had the use only of their hands, being destitute of legs, the masterless and weak, those that vainly strived to earn a living, the ignorant, in fact, all those that were in pitiable circumstances, all the ambassadors arrived from all sides, etc. He concluded with this message to <i>Duryodhana</i>: “give me back my own <i>Indraprastha (Śakrapurīṃ</i>), or fight with me” (V, <b>30</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that the Creator (<i>Dhātṛ</i>) gives and takes according to his will. He told <i>Sañjaya</i> especially to salute <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Vidura</i>, and recommend the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to them, that they might counsel peace; and to say to <i>Duryodhana</i> that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were willing to forgive his insults to <i>Draupadī (Kṛṣṇā</i>) and <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> dragging her, disregarding <i>Kuntī</i>; but they must have their proper share of the kingdom; “give us even a single province of the empire; give us even <i>Kuśasthala</i> (B. <i>Avi°</i>), <i>Vṛkasthala, Mākandī</i>, <i>Vāraṇāvata</i>, and in the fifth place any other village that thou likest; even this will end the quarrel.” He said that to see the <i>Kurus</i> and the <i>Pāñśālas</i> live happily united was what he desired (V, <b>31</b>). Having returned to <i>Hāstinapura</i>, <i>Sañjaya</i> addressed <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> at night; he praised <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, “who shines in his natural perfection, leaving his load of sins to be borne by thee,” while <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> acts were contrary to both religion and profit. In delivering the message from <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> he did not mention the alternative of giving them the five villages. He alluded to <i>Arjuna's</i> ascending to the very heavens and being honoured there. King <i>Bali</i>, not finding a primary cause (<i>pāraṃ</i>), regarded time (<i>kālaḥ</i>) to be the cause of everything. “To-morrow morning the <i>Kurus</i>, assembled together in the council-hall, will hear the words of <i>Ajātaśatru</i> (i.e. <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i>)” (V, <b>32</b>)."
