Indra once performed a sacrifice which lasted for a thousand years. Variṣṭha and Gṛtsamada, as friends of Indra were present at the sacrifice. Gṛtsamada committed some mistakes in the recitation of Sāmans. Variṣṭha got angry and cursed Gṛtsamada that he would wander in the forest as an animal for ten thousand one hundred and eighteen years. Accordingly Gṛtsamada wandered through forests in the form of an animal for a very long time."
