Context throws no further light. Interpretation of these two terms obscure. Are they somehow related to āsario = saṃmukhāgataḥ <ls>Deśīn.</ls> 〔1.69〕, and ṇissariaṃ = srastam <ab>ibid.</ab> 〔4.40〕? Something like <i>slack condition, slumped-down state</i> might be intended by niḥsarita; would āsarita be its opposite, a state <i>arrived</i> at the right point?"
