Result of his three sins — displeasing his father, killing the Guru's cow and eating unconsecrated flesh; banished from the kingdom; seeing this Viśvāmitra consoled him and agreed to be his Guru; the latter had him crowned after a purification bath in the river, Karmanāśā near the Vindhyas; this enabled him to go to heaven bodily and get a place among the planets all in the presence of Vasiṣṭha; though thrust down headlong from heaven, he was stopped and given a place in the sky. <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā.
