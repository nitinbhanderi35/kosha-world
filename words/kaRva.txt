From Ṛgveda it can be gathered that the Kaṇva family was very prominent among the Ṛṣi families of ancient India. Because he was born in the family of sage Kaśyapa, son of Brahmā, Kaṇva was known as Kāśyapa also. Kaṇva's father was Medhātithi as could be seen by a reference to him in Śloka 27, Chapter 208 of Śānti Parva as Medhātithisuta. Kaṇva was staying in a hermitage on the banks of the river Mālinī, with a number of disciples. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Kaṇvāśrama.</i> Vana Parva of Mahābhārata states that Kaṇvāśrama was on the northern shore of the river Praveṇī. According to certain critics Kaṇvāśrama was situated on the banks of the river Cambal, four miles to the south of ‘Kota’in Rājputānā. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>How Kaṇva got Śakuntalā.</i> Once Viśvāmitra started a severe penance and Indra desiring to obstruct the attempt sent the enchanting Menakā to entice him. They fell in love with each other and soon Menakā bore a girl. The parents left the child in the forest and went their way. Birds (Śakuntas) looked after her for some time and so she was named Śakuntalā. Accidentally Kaṇva came that way and took the child to his Āśrama. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>The Yāga of Bharata.</i> Bharata, son of Duṣyanta, performed a peculiar type of Yāga called ‘Govitata’ with Kaṇva as the chief preceptor to officiate. (Śloka 130, Chapter 74, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Kaṇva and Duryodhana.</i> Once Kaṇva narrated to Duryodhana how Mātali and his wife Sudharmā went to him in search of a suitable husband to their daughter Guṇakeśī. (Chapter 97, Udyoga Parva, M.B.). <dvsn n='NI'/>6) <i>Kaṇva, a sage of the east.</i> When Śrī Rāma returned to Ayodhyā after his exile many sages from many different parts came to visit him. Kaṇva was one of those who came from the east. The others who came along with him were, Vasiṣṭha, Atri, Viśvāmitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvāja, Sanaka, Śarabhaṅga Durvāsas, Mataṅga, Vibhāṇḍaka and Tumburu. <dvsn n='NI'/>7) <i>Kaṇva and Ṛgveda.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) There are ten Maṇḍalas in Ṛgveda. The Maṇḍalas from two to seven are written by different Ṛṣi families. The second Maṇḍala was written by the Bhārgava family of ṛṣis, the third by the Viśvāmitra family, the fourth by that of Vāmadeva, the fifth by Atri, the sixth by that of Bharadvāja and the seventh by the family of Vasiṣṭha. Fifty Sūktas of the first Maṇḍala and the whole of the eighth Maṇḍala were written by Kaṇva. <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Kaṇva had a son named Medhātithi. Sūkta twelve of Anuvāka four in the first Maṇḍala of Ṛgveda is written making Medhātithi a sage. <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Kaṇva had a daughter named Indīvaraprabhā by Menakā. (Kathāsaritsāgara).
