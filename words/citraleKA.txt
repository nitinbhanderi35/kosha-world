            "content": "CITRALEKHĀ II¦. A companion of Uṣā, daughter of the demon, Bāṇa. She was a beautiful portrait painter. Uṣā once dreamt of Aniruddha, grandson of Kṛṣṇa. Even before knowing the identity of the idol of her dream Uṣā fell in love with him. Next day morning Citralekhā gathered from the gloomy Uṣā details of her dream and Citralekhā started making portraits of many known charming princes but Uṣā was not satisfied. She then drew in her imagination a figure which was exactly like that of Aniruddha, the man of her dream. Uṣā was satisfied and it was through the cleverness of Chitralekhā that Aniruddha was brought to Uṣā's room and Uṣā was able to marry Aniruddha. (See under ‘Aniruddha’)."
