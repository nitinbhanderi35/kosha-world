He had accurate knowledge as to which parts of the yajña-cow should be distributed to whom, and till death he did not impart this knowledge to anyone. But, sometime afterwards a non-human individual taught the subject to Girija, son of Babhru. (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>At the time when the Sṛñjayas and the Kuru kings were living in amity consequent upon the dākṣāyaṇa yajña it was this Devabhāga who acted as the priest of both the parties. His theories on Sāvitrāgni are quoted in Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa."
