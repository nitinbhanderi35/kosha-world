Bhīṣma related the old narrative of the discourse in days of yore, in <i>Dharma-yuga</i>, between king <i>Janaka Maithila</i> <i>Dharmadhvaja</i> (devoted to renunciation, conversant with the Veda, the <i>mokṣa-śāstra</i>, etc.), whom many wise men desired to imitate, and the female mendicant <i>Sulabhā</i>, who practised <i>Yoga</i> and wandered over the Earth, and had heard from many <i>tridaṇḍins</i> about <i>Janaka</i>. By her <i>Yoga-</i>power she assumed a beautiful form and instantly repaired to <i>Mithilā</i>, and, on pretence of begging alms, presented herself before the king, who was surrounded by his ministers and learned scholars. By <i>Yoga</i> she entered the king's consciousness by her own consciousness (<i>sattvaṃ sattvena</i>). Then they conversed upon emancipation. The king said he was a disciple of the <i>bhikṣu Pañcaśikha</i> of <i>Parāśara's</i> race, and fully conversant with <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and <i>Yoga</i>, etc.; <i>Pañcaśikha</i> had dwelt with him for four months in the rainy season. <i>Sulabhā</i> enumerated thirty principles. <i>Sulabhā</i> was the daughter of R-ṛ <i>Pradhāna</i>; in the sacrifices of her ancestors <i>Indra</i> used to come with <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (α); no suitable husband could be obtained for her; therefore, she wandered over the earth alone, observant of the practices of asceticism. <i>Sulabhā</i> dwelt this one night in his person like a mendicant in an empty house (XII, <b>321</b>)."
