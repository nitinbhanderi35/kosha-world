Adopted as son by Viśvāmitra. When his first fifty sons refused to recognise him as their brother, they were cursed to be Mlecchas. The younger fifty agreed to regard him as their brother and were blessed. He is Śuna to Bhṛgu family and Devarāta to the Gādhi line. His advent with the Kauśika family distinguished it from the Viśvāmitras; compared to Prahlāda. <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. IX. 7. 21; 16. 30-37; VII. 5. 46; Br. III. 66. 66 and 74; Vā. 91. 92-6."
