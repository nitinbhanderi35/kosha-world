There are two inferences about this Śaunaka. In Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha we find that the sage Gṛtsamada who belonged to Bhṛguvaṃśa had a son named Śunaka and this Śunaka's son was named Śaunaka. A son named Śunaka was born to King Ruru by his wife Pramadvarā. Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 5 mentions that this Śunaka was an exceptionally brilliant scholar in Vedas and Śāstras and was the grandfather of Śaunaka. Ruru's son, Śunaka was a member of Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 10)."
