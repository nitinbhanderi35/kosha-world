Raghuvaṃśa, Kumārasambhava, Kirātārjunīya, Śiśupālavadha and Naiṣadha are the five Mahākāvyas in Sanskrit with established reputation. In the Ehole records of A.D. 634 Bhāravi is held up in praise along with Kālidāsa. <F>1) Yenāyoji na veśma sthiram arthavidhau vivekinā jinaveśma/ Sa jayatāṃ ravikīrtiḥ kavitāśrita-Kālidāsa-Bhāravikīrtiḥ.//</F> The theme of Kirātārjunīya is Śiva, in the guise of a hunter, attacking Arjuna immersed in penance. Bhāravi's literary style is simple and sweet. In the use of similes he is second only to Kālidāsa. Among his books only Kirātārjunīya has been found out yet."
