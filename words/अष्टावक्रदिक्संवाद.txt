Vadānya</i> first caused him to make a journey to the North, indicating the road: (1) <i>Himavat</i> (peopled by Si. and Cā.); (2) the sacred river <i>Bāhudā</i>, where he bathed in one of the <i>tīrthas</i>, etc. (description), and worshipped <i>Rudra</i> and <i>Umā</i>; (3) <i>Kailāsa</i>, where he saw a golden gate, etc. (α), and was honoured by <i>Kubera</i> among Y. (with <i>Maṇibhadra</i>), G., and K., and where Aps. (β) danced; there he remained a celestial year; (4) having crossed <i>Kailāsa</i> and <i>Mandara</i> as also the golden mountains, he came to the region where <i>Mahādeva</i> resides attired as an ascetic, <i>Pārṣadas</i> of which are frolicsome and fond of dance and possessed of faces of diverse forms, which was peopled by Si., Cā., and Pc., where <i>Umā</i> had practised austerities for the sake of [obtaining] <i>Śiva</i>; where, in days of yore, on the <i>Mahāpārśva</i> [mountain] (to the north of the god) the Seasons, etc. (αʹ), in their material forms had adored <i>Mahādeva</i>; (5) a beautiful forest (description), where the river <i>Mandākinī</i> was seen, with an old and decrepit female ascetic (with many beautiful maidens), who in vain tempted him with love (XIII, <b>19</b>), at last appearing in a beautiful form (XIII, <b>20</b>). She turned out to be the goddess of the North (<i>Uttarāṃ diśaṃ</i>), who, having been gratified by Ṛ. <i>Vadānya</i>, had devised this trial and now instructed him, showing him the levity of women, even when aged; “thou hast subjugated all the worlds by thy strength of mind; thy journey back will not be irksome thou wilt obtain the wife thou hast chosen; she will bear thee a son.” <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i> came back to his own abode, and then to <i>Vadānya</i>, who wedded him to the girl. There he continued to dwell joyously in his own hermitage (XIII, <b>21</b>)."
