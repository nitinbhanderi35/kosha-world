Karṇadigv.): <i>Karṇa</i> proposed to <i>Duryodhana</i> that he should celebrate a <i>rājasūya</i> sacrifice like <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. But as the <i>purohita</i> told him that so long as <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> were living he could not undertake the <i>rājasūya</i> sacrifice, and advised him to cause the tributary kings to pay him tribute in gold, and with that gold to make a plough, and to plough the sacrificial compound with it, and then to perform a <i>Vaiṣṇava</i> sacrifice that nobody had performed before save the ancient <i>Viṣṇu</i> (v. 15292, cf. v. 15329 foll.) which was equal to the <i>rājasūya</i>, this plan was agreed upon. <i>Duryodhana</i> appointed persons to their respective tasks, and desired all the artisans to construct the plough, etc. (III, <b>255</b>). When <i>Vidura</i> had announced to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> that the preparations had been made, messengers were dispatched to invite the princes and the <i>brahmans</i>. <i>Duḥśāsana</i> ordered one messenger to invite the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, but <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> replied that they could not come before the com— pletion of the thirteenth year. <i>Bhīma</i> threatened; the other <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> said nothing unpleasant. <i>Vidura</i> was charged with the distribution of food to the guests. After the completion of the sacrifice, all the kings having been dismissed, <i>Duryodhana</i>, with his brothers and <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śakuni</i>, entered <i>Hāstinapura</i> (III, <b>256</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> was praised by most of the citizens, and his friends compared him to <i>Yayāti, Nahuṣa, Māndhātṛ</i>, and <i>Bharata</i>, who had gone to heaven after celebrating this sacrifice (v. 15329 foll., cf. v. 15292). <i>Karṇa</i> said that when <i>Duryodhana</i> had slain the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in battle and completed the <i>rājasūya</i> sacrifice he would once more honour him thus, and promised that until he had slain <i>Arjuna</i> he would not allow his feet to be washed, nor taste meat, and he would observe the <i>Asura</i> vow (i.e. not to drink intoxicating liquors, Nīl.), and never refuse to give to whoever might solicit him."
