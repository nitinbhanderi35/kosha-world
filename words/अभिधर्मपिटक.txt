(-कः) ‘The basket of the revealed truth’: the name of one of the three collections which comprise the sacred books of the Buddhists; (for the two others see सूत्रपिटक and विनयपिटक); the instructions contained in it were addressed by the Buddha to the Devas and Brahmas of the celestial worlds (while those in the <i>Sūtra-</i> <i>piṭaka</i> were addressed to the laity and those in the <i>Vinayap.</i> to the priests); its redaction however is not ascribed to Sākya Muni, but to his principal disciple <i>Kāśyapa,</i> the chief of the first Buddhistic synod. It contains seven sections, the text with 96, 250 stanzas, the commentaries with 30,000, consisting, therefore, in the whole of 126,250 stanzas; its best representative is the work called <i>Prajnāpāramitā;</i> (comp. <i>Spence Hardy'</i>s <i>East. Mon.</i> p. 170 with the quot. given there, and those s. v. अभिधर्म). E. अभिधर्म and पिटक."
