He was a contemporary of Uddālaka. <dvsn n='NI'/>Pravāhaṇa was a great Dārśanika (philosopher) and he once held a Tattvajñāna Parisad (seminar of philosophers). With a view to defeating the king in a discussion Śvetaketu also attended the seminar. But Śvetaketu was unable to answer the five questions put to him by Pravāhaṇa. Ashamed of the defeat Śvetaketu went to his father Uddālaka, who was his Guru in Jñānavidyā also, and asked him the questions put by Pravāhaṇa. Uddālaka also was unable to answer the questions and they both went to Pravāhaṇa and the latter gave as a gift to those brahmins whatever knowledge he had on Tattvajñāna then. (Chāndogyopaniṣad)."
