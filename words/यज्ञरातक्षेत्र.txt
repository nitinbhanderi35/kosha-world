Yajña means sacrifice or worship and rāta means ‘given’ presented, bestowed’.<sup>522</sup> The whole will literally mean ‘given by Yajña’. The field may be a place of worship or sacrifice. Because of the performance of Yajña on a certain occasion the field came to be so named as if it was a permanent place of sacrifice or the field might have been named after a person ‘Yajñarāta’. <dvsn n='P'/><i>Place-names ending in Puṣkariṇī</i>"
