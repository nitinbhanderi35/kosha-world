            "content": "BAKA I¦. A demon. The Pāṇḍavas escaping from the trap of Arakkilla (lac-house) through a secret tunnel went to the village Ekacakrā on the banks of the river Gaṅgā and stayed there in the house of a brahmin. Baka was a demon who was terrorising the villagers there. He used to come to the village freely and carry away people for his food. Because of this nobody lived in peace and so they all joined together and decided to send one man daily with plenty of other eatables to the demon in this cave. Days went by like that and one day the turn came to the brahmin who was sheltering the Pāṇḍavas. That brahmin had besides his wife one son and a daughter. The problem arose as to who should go to the demon. The father was willing but the wife did not want him to go and vice versa. The children began to cry and hearing the noise Kuntī, mother of the Pāṇḍavas, went there to enquire and learned the tragic story of the family. She immediately went to Bhīma and acquainted him with the problem before the brahmin. Bhīma at once volunteered to go to the demon deciding to kill the man-eater and thus putting an end to his depredations. <dvsn n='NI'/>Bhīma started on his journey to the demon carrying a cartload of rice and curry. Deliberately Bhīma arrived at the place of the demon very late. Baka rolled his eyes in anger at the sight of the late-comer. But Bhīma without heeding him sat in front of the demon and started eating the rice and curry. Baka charged at Bhīma with fury but Bhīma defended and a battle ensued in which Baka was killed and he fell dead like a mountain-head dropping down. <F>*) Kirmīra, a demon, was the brother of Baka. (Śloka 23, Chapter 11, Araṇya Parva, M.B.). <i>f</i> It is in the 10th Skandha of Bhāgavata that the story of this Baka occurs. But in the vernacular translation of the same the story is not so clear. Hence the original in Sanskrit is quoted below: <Poem>Sa vai Bako nāma mahānasuro bakarūpadhṛk Āgatya sahasā Kṛṣṇam tīkṣṇatuṇḍo 'grasadbalī Kṛṣṇam mahābakagrastaṃ dṛṣṭvā Rāmādayo 'rbhakāḥ Babhūvurindriyāṇīva vinā prāṇaṃ vicetasaḥ.</Poem></F> (Chapters 157164, Ādi Parva, M.B.)."

As young boys Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāmabhadra were once playing in Ambāḍi (Gokula) on the banks of the river Yamunā when the demon, Baka, despatched by Kaṃsa, went to them in the form of a huge terrible-looking stork. In no time opening its ferocious beaks the stork swallowed Kṛṣṇa. But the touch of Kṛṣṇa burnt the throat of the bird and vomitting Kṛṣṇa the bird fell dead."
