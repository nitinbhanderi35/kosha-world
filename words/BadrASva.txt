Bhadrāśvā had ten sons: Ṛkṣeyu, Kṛṣeyu, Sannateyu, Ghṛteyu, Citeyu, Sthaṇḍileyu, Dharmeyu, Sammiteyu, Kṛteyu and Matināra. (Chapter 278, Agni Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Agastya went and stayed for seven days in the palace of Bhadrāśva and his wife Kāntimatī. Everyday Agastya used to speak in glowing terms about Kāntimatī and asked about the reason for it he replied: “In her previous birth Kāntimatī was a servant girl in a wealthy house. The master of the house once entrusted her with the task of seeing that none of the temple lights went out on the night of Dvādaśī in the month of Tulā (Āśvina—October). She did her duty so willingly and sincerely that she was born as a queen and you a King”. Then Agastya gave them instructions about that Vrata which both Bhadrāśva and Kāntimatī observed sincerely, receiving as a result benediction from Viṣṇu. (Vāyu Purāṇa)."
