He resolved to attain to the highest end, that is fraught with the greatest felicity, and whence there is no return into the ocean of births; “that cannot be attained without <i>yoga</i>; I shall therefore have recourse to <i>yoga</i>, and throwing off this body I shall become transformed into wind and enter the Sun; for he does not wane like the Moon (Soma) with the gods; when after death one enters the moon he falls to earth and thence ascends to heaven; with the great Ṛṣis I shall enter the energy of the Sun; I declare before all the creatures… earth,…D., Dā., G., Pś., U., Rā., and R., that I shall enter all creatures in the world.” Obtaining <i>Nārada's</i> permission, <i>Śuka</i> went to <i>Vyāsa</i>, who asked him to stay there for the day that he might behold him for some time. But <i>Śuka</i>, only intent on emancipation, immediately left him and proceeded to <i>Kailāsa</i>, which was inhabited by crowds of ascetics (XII, <b>332</b>). Having reached the summit of <i>Kailāsa, Śuka</i> set himself to practise <i>yoga</i> (description). Having then obtained the permission of <i>Nārada</i>, he soared into the skies and identified himself with the element of wind; Aps. (<i>Pañcacūḍā</i>, etc.), G., R., etc., wondered. <i>Śuka</i> proceeded in silence, his face turned towards the east, regarding the sun; then to the <i>Malaya</i> mountain; <i>Urvaśī</i> and <i>Pūrvacitti</i>, who always dwell on <i>Malaya</i>, wondered. <i>Śuka</i> asked the gods, etc., to return his father an answer from him, if he should repeatedly call on him (XII, <b>333</b>). <i>Śuka</i> freed himself of the four kinds of faults, the eight kinds of <i>tamas</i>, the five kinds of <i>rajas</i>, the attribute of <i>sattva</i>, and then dwelt in <i>Bráhman</i>. Meteors began to shoot, etc.; <i>Indra</i> poured showers of rain; <i>Himavat</i> and <i>Meru</i> (the one yellow, made of gold; the other white, made of silver), each 100 yojanas in height and breadth, were in close contact with each other. Journeying towards the north, <i>Śuka</i> clashed against them, and they were immediately broken in two. He was adored by G., R., Y., Rā., and <i>Vidyādharas</i>. He saw from a high region the celestial stream <i>Mandākinī</i> running below, with many Aps. Beholding <i>Śuka</i>, who was bodyless, those unclad aërial beings felt no shame. <i>Vyāsa</i> followed behind him on the same aërial path, by means of high <i>Yoga</i>. <i>Śuka</i>, above the region of the wind, identified himself with <i>Bráhman</i>. Ṛ. represented to <i>Vyāsa</i> the achievements of his son. He indulged in lamentations; <i>Śuka</i>, who had entered the universe, had become the soul of everything, and had acquired omnipresence, answered by uttering <i>bho</i> in the form of an echo, and the entire universe echoed the answer of <i>Śuka</i> from that time; mountain caves and mountain sides still echo sounds uttered there. Having cast off all the attributes of sound, etc., and showing his <i>yoga</i> prowess in the manner of his disappearance, <i>Śuka</i> in this way attained to the highest station. <i>Vyāsa</i> sat down and began to think of his son with grief; the Aps. who were sporting on the banks of the celestial stream <i>Mandākinī</i> saw him seated there, and all became agitated with shame. <i>Śiva</i>, with D., G., and great Ṛ., came and comforted <i>Vyāsa</i>, who by the favour of <i>Śiva</i> thenceforward always beheld a shadow of his son by his side. “This <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Vyāsa</i> repeatedly told me in days of yore” (XII, <b>334</b>). [PCR. rightly remarks that, according to this story, <i>Śuka</i> who recited the Bhāgavata to Parikṣit, the grandson of Yudhiṣṭhira, could not possibly be the <i>Śuka</i> who was <i>Vyāsa's</i> son.]"
