It was on the delta of this river that Śiva imparted advice to Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 78, Verse 15). Living on the northern bank of this river is equal to living in Svarga. (Vana Parva, Chapter 88). To perform bali and other rites for the souls of the dead after bathing in the river is as efficacious as performing the Agniṣṭoma Yajña. (Vana Parva, Chapter 88)."
