Āśramavāsa). § 787: Asked by Janamejaya how the Pāṇḍavas, having acquired their kingdom, conducted themselves towards <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, how Dhṛtarāṣṭra and <i>Gāndhārī</i> behaved, and for how many years his grandfather ruled the kingdom, Vaiśampāyana said: The Pāṇḍavas ruled, placing Dhṛtarāṣṭra at their head; <i>Vidura, Sañjaya</i>, and <i>Yuyutsu</i> used to wait upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra; for 15 years they did all things under the advice of the old king; <i>Kuntī</i> obeyed Gāndhūrī; <i>Draupadī</i> and <i>Subhadrā</i>, etc., showed the utmost respect for the old king and his queen; the Pāṇḍavas surrounded the old king and his queen with every luxury, and Maireya wines, etc. <i>Kṛpa</i> waited upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra; <i>Vyāsa</i> frequently visited him and recited histories of old Ṛ., celestial ascetics, P., and Rā.; Vidura, under the orders of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, superintended religion and law; through his policy the Pāṇḍavas obtained numerous services from their feudatories and followers; Dhṛtarāṣṭra liberated prisoners and pardoned those condemned to death; the old king, on his pleasure excursions, was supplied with everything by Yudhiṣṭhira; the kings who came to Hāstinapura waited upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra as before; Kuntī, etc. (α), served Gāndhārī like maidservants; <i>Bhīmasena</i> alone did not forget his grievances (XV, <b>1</b>); Dhṛtarāṣṭra was honoured by Ṛ., and used to make gifts to the brahmans in rites for P. and <i>śrāddhas</i> for his sons, etc.; Dhṛtarāṣṭra also felt great affection for the Pāṇḍavas, and so did Gāndhārī; Gāndhārī performed śrāddhas with gifts; grieved at the remembrance of Duryodhana, Dhṛtarāṣṭra every morning blessed the Pāṇḍavas, wishing them victory in battle, etc. Yudhiṣṭhira became very much liked by all the four castes, and forgot the wrongs inflicted upon him by Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons; from fear of Yudhiṣṭhira nobody dared to speak evil of Duryodhana or Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Bhīma, however, reverenced the old king outwardly, with a very unwilling heart (XV, <b>2</b>). While there was no variance in the cordiality between Yudhiṣṭhira and Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the latter could not but feel unfriendly towards Bhīma, and Bhīma, recollecting his foes Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Duḥśāsana, indulged in boastful language about Duryodhana and his brothers whom he had slain. Gāndhārī was not moved. After 15 years Dhṛtarāṣṭra, afflicted by the wordy darts of Bhīma, became penetrated with despair and grief; Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. (β), did not know it. Dhṛtarāṣṭra opened his heart to his friends (γ); now he was observing a vow of fast, which he had concealed from Yudhiṣṭhira, lying on the earth clad in deerskin; Gāndhārī observed similar vows; now he asked Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for himself and Gāndhārī to retire into the woods clad in rags and bark in order to practise austerities. Yudhiṣṭhira lamented (δ) (“Let Yuyutsu be made king; I shall go into the woods”); but Dhṛtarāṣṭra's resolution remains unaltered; he asked Sañjaya and Kṛpa to speak for him to Yudhiṣṭhira; leaning on Gāndhārī he looked like one deprived of life; Yudhiṣṭhira lamented (ε), and gently rubbed Dhṛtarāṣṭra's breast and face with cold water and revived him by the touch of his hand, on which were jewels and medicinal herbs. Dhṛtarāṣṭra said that the touch of Yudhiṣṭhira was highly gratifying, embraced him, and smelt his head; Vidura, Kuntī, etc., wept; Gāndhārī bore her sorrow with fortitude. Dhṛtarāṣṭra renewed his request; Vyāsa came (XV, <b>3</b>) and asked Yudhiṣṭhira to permit Dhṛtarāṣṭra to follow the path of all the ancient R.-ṛ.; “Gāndhārī bears her grief with fortitude.” Yudhiṣṭhira yielded to Vyāsa's intercession; Vyāsa summed ap the reasons for Dhṛtarāṣṭra's retirement (ζ), and then proceeded to the woods. Yudhiṣṭhira then said that he would conform to the advice of Vyāsa, etc. (η) (XV, <b>4</b>); Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī, etc. (η), entering the palace of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, ate a little. Then Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave Yudhiṣṭhira advice about how the latter should rule his kingdom (θ) (XV, <b>5</b>). Continuation (XV, <b>6</b>). Continuation; agreeably to the science known to Uśanas, [arrays called] Śakaṭa, Padma, and Vajra should be formed; “thou hast been instructed in all duties by Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa, and Vidura”; 100 horse-sacrifices and righteous rule are productive of equal merit (XV, <b>7</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira gratefully accepted his instructions, as Bhīṣma, etc. (ι), no longer were there to instruct him. Dhṛtarāṣṭra wishes to depart soon, and Gāndhārī reminded him that he has got the permission of Vyāsa, and asks him when he would go to the forest with the permission of Yudhiṣṭhira; he wished first to make gifts for the advancement in the other world of his dead sons and other kinsmen (who were now <i>pretas</i>), and assembled all the subjects, while Yudhiṣṭhira brought all the articles necessary; Dhṛtarāṣṭra, in a touching address, took leave of that large concourse of men of all the four castes (κ) (XV, <b>8</b>), recapitulating the history of the realm from Śāntanu downwards (λ) (XV, <b>9</b>). The citizens were exceedingly agitated upon hearing Dhṛtarāṣṭra's address; they charged the learned brahman Śāmba (B. Sāmba) with answering him (μ): “King Duryodhana never did us any wrong; we were well protected and ruled by him; we have also enjoyed great happiness for thousands of years under Yudhiṣṭhira, who follows the conduct of the R.-ṛ. of old (Kuru, Saṃvaraṇa, Bharata, etc.); the carnage on the field of Kurukṣetra was not brought about by Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Śakuni, nor by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, but by Destiny, which in 18 days caused 18 <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> to be destroyed by Bhīṣma, etc. (ν); the Pāṇḍavas are capable of ruling without either thee or ourselves to look after them; Kuntī, etc. (ξ), will not do the least wrong to the people.” Then Dhṛtarāṣṭra slowly dismissed the assembly, and entered his house with Gāndhārī (XV, <b>10</b>). After that night had passed away, Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent Vidura to Yudhiṣṭhira in order to announce that he would set out for the woods on the coming day of the full moon in the month of Kārttika, and to solicit some wealth for performing the <i>śrāddha</i> of Bhīṣma, etc. (ο). Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna applauded his words; Bhīma was unwilling, recollecting Duryodhana; Arjuna sought to pacify him, applauded by Yudhiṣṭhira; Bhīmasena maintained that gifts for Bhīṣma, etc. (π), should be given by them, and by Kuntī for Karṇa; “Let Duryodhana, etc., sink from a miserable to a more miserable position,” reminding his brothers of the woes and disgrace inflicted upon them by those for whose benefit Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked for wealth (ρ). Yudhiṣṭhira rebuked him (XV, <b>11</b>). Arjuna urged Bhīma to forget the injuries. Yudhiṣṭhira said to Vidura that he would give Dhṛtarāṣṭra so much wealth as he wished for the obsequies of his sons and Bhīṣma, etc., and asked him to tell Dhṛtarāṣṭra not to be angry with Bhīmasena (XV, <b>12</b>). Vidura reported the speeches of Yudhiṣṭhira, Arjuna, and Bhīma to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Dhṛtarāṣṭra expressed his satisfaction, and set his heart on making large presents on the day of full moon in the month of Kārttika (XV, <b>13</b>). Dhṛtarāṣṭra invited thousands of deserving brahmans [and] superior Ṛ. for Bhīṣma, etc.; and made large gifts to them, naming Droṇa, etc. (σ); tellers and scribes appointed by Yudhiṣṭhira ceaselessly ask the old king as to what should be given to each recipient that presented himself; unto him that was to receive 100 a 1000 were given, and he who was to receive 1000 was presented with 10,000 at the command of Yudhiṣṭhira; this was given by Dhṛtarāṣṭra for the benefit in the other world of his sons and grandsons, as also of himself and Gāndhārī; the donation lasted for 10 days (XV, <b>14</b>). On the day of full moon in the month of Kārttika Dhṛtarāṣṭra (and Gāṅdhārī) summoned the Pāṇḍavas, caused the rites to be performed, and his sacred fire to be taken up, put on deerskins and bark, and set out with his daughtersin-law. The ladies uttered loud wails; Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna were pierced with grief; Bhīmasena, etc. (τ), all followed Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Kuntī held on her shoulders the hand of Gāndhārī, who walked with her bandaged eyes; Dhṛtarāṣṭra walked behind Gāndhārī, placing his hand on her shoulder; Kṛṣṇā, etc. (υ), all-proceeded with Dhṛtarāṣṭra; the citizens of all orders were as distressed as they had been at the departure of the Pāṇḍavas after the match of dice († 431—440) (XV, <b>15</b>); Dhṛtarāṣṭra left the city through the principal gate, and then asked those who followed him to desist. Vidura and Sañjaya retired with him into the woods; Kṛpa and Yuyutsu he caused to remain, and made them over to Yudhiṣṭhira. Kuntī retired with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, though Yudhiṣṭhira sought to dissuade her; she said: “Never show any disregard for Sahadeva: he is very much attached to me, and to thee also”; then she reminded him of Karṇa, etc. (ϕ); Yudhiṣṭhira reminded her that she had herself formerly recited to them the story of Vidulā, when they were about to set out from the town, and that they had won sovereignty guided by her words communicated through Kṛṣṇa. Also Bhīma dissuaded her, pointing out the grief of the sons of Mādrī; but in vain. Draupadī and Subhadrā followed her, and so did the Pāṇḍavas with all their wives and attendants; Kuntī addressed them (XV, <b>16</b>), assigning her reasons for her conduct (χ) (XV, <b>17</b>). The Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī then desisted from following her. The Pāṇḍavas circumambulated Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., for taking their leave to return. Dhṛtarāṣṭra (with Gāndhārī and Vidura) made a final effort of dissuading Kuntī from retiring into the forest with him, but in vain. The ladies set up a loud wail of grief. Hāstinapura became plunged into sorrow: no festivals were observed. The Pāṇḍavas were without any energy. Dhṛtarāṣṭra arrived on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī and took rest there for the night among the brahmans, who there, like himself, ignited their sacred fires; arrangement of the beds of Vidura, etc. (ψ); the Yājaka brahmans, etc., of the king laid themselves down on their respective beds; that night seemed as delightful to them as a Brāhmī night. When the night had passed away Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., going through their morning acts and rites, continue their journey (XV, <b>18</b>). Following the advice of Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra took up his abode on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī; many of the four orders came to see him; he gladdened them all by his words. At evening Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (ω), bathed in the stream, etc.; Kuntī led him and Gāndhārī. Then he proceeded to Kurukṣetra to the retreat of R.-ṛ. Śatayūpa (<i>b</i>), who received him with due rites; accompanied by him he proceeded to the retreat of Vyāsa, where he received the initiation [into the forest life]; after having returned he took up his abode in the retreat of Śatayūpa, who instructed him in all the rites of the forest mode of life, at the command of Vyāsa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (αα), began to practise austerities (XV, <b>19</b>). Ṛ. Nārada, etc. (ββ), came there and gladdened Dhṛtarāṣṭra with discourses on religion. Ṛ. Nārada mentioned the kings that attained to heaven after practising penances in that very retreat (γγ): Sahasracitya, Śailālaya, Pṛṣadhra, Purukutsa, Śaśaloman; “Thou also wilt, with Gāndhārī, through the grace of Vyāsa, attain to a very high goal; dwelling in the presence of Indra, Pāṇḍu always thinks of thee, and will assist thee in the attainment of prosperity; Kuntī, by serving thee and Gāndhārī, will obtain residence with her husband in the other world; we behold all this with our spiritual vision; Vidura will enter into Yudhiṣṭhira; Sañjaya will ascend to Heaven.” Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., praised Nārada. Śatayūpa asked Nārada what regions (<i>lokāḥ</i>) will be acquired by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Nārada said: On a visit to Indra I saw Pāṇḍu; Indra said that after three years Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī would go to the abode of Kubera, on a car moving at will, and he would rove through the regions of D., G., and Rā.; this is a mystery of the gods. All the persons present (as also Dhṛtarāṣṭra) became highly pleased. Then they went away by the path of the Siddhas (XV, <b>20</b>).—§ 788: The anxiety of the Pāṇḍavas and citizens about the fate of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., and their despair when they reflected on that terrible slaughter of their kinsmen (α); only Parikṣit somehow consoled them (XV, <b>21</b>); afflicted with grief, they failed to derive pleasure from anything, nor did they attend to their kingly offices, thinking of Kuntī and Gāndhārī. They set their heart upon seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra in his forest retreat. Sahadeva, lamenting the fate of Kuntī, and expressing his longing to see her, proposed a visit to the woods, supported by Draupadī, who mentioned Kuntī and Gāndhārī and Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Yudhiṣṭhira caused his army to be equipped, ordered litters, etc., for the ladies, and proclaimed that they would march out to-morrow, permitting the citizens to follow them. The next morning they set out, then waited five days for such citizens as would accompany them, and then proceeded towards the forest (XV, <b>22</b>), headed by Arjuna (on a car with white horses) and Kṛpa (description of the expedition); Bhīma on a gigantic elephant, the twins on two fleet steeds, the ladies in closed litters, scattering showers of wealth as they proceeded, headed by Draupadī. They proceeded slowly. Yuyutsu and Dhaumya protected the city. They reached Kurukṣetra, crossed the Yamunā, and approached the retreat of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (XV, <b>23</b>). The Pāṇḍavas and their followers, alighting from their cars, walked on foot; the ascetics told them that Dhṛtarāṣṭra had gone to the Yamunā for his ablutions, etc., and pointed out the way to them. Sahadeva ran with speed towards Kuntī; they both wept; she informed Gāndhārī, and then advanced towards Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. (β), dragging the childless old couple; the Pāṇḍavas fell down at their feet, and took from their hands the jars of water they were carrying. Yudhiṣṭhira presented all his followers one after another to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, mentioning their names and races. Dhṛtarāṣṭra rejoiced and went to his retreat that was applauded by Si. and Cā. (XV, <b>24</b>). To the ascetics, who had come from various regions in order to see the Pāṇḍavas, Sañjaya pointed out each of them (†γ); then Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked († v. 660—674) (XV, <b>25</b>) Yudhiṣṭhira about the welfare of the Pāṇḍavas and their devotion to P. and D.; Yudhiṣṭhira answered, enquiring after Vidura, who turned out to be engaged in penances, subsisting on air alone, and was now seen at a distance with matted locks, and gravel in his mouth, and exceedingly emaciated, naked, and besmeared with filth and dust; Vidura fled, pursued by Yudhiṣṭhira; at last he stood motionless in <i>yoga</i>, and entered the body of Yudhiṣṭhira, who felt that he had become stronger than before and had acquired many additional virtues and accomplishments, and recollected his own state before his birth among men; he had heard of <i>yoga</i>-practice from Vyāsa. He desired to cremate the lifeless body of Vidura, but was prevented by an invisible voice which said, that in Vidura (who was Dharma) was Yudhiṣṭhira's body also, and that Vidura would attain to the regions (<i>lokāḥ</i>) called Santānikāḥ. Yudhiṣṭhira came and informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra; all became filled with wonder. They passed that night under a tree (XV, <b>26</b>), conversing on morality and wealth. The next morning they surveyed the retreat (description) and the other retreats in the forest. Yudhiṣṭhira made presents to the ascetics (specification); then he returned to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (δ); many M.-ṛ. (Śatayūpa, etc.) who dwelt in Kurukṣetra came there, as also Vyāsa (XV, <b>27</b>), who enquired after Dhṛtarāṣṭra's, etc. (ε), welfare, and told them who Vidura was, mentioning the curse of Dharma by Māṇḍavya (with an expenditure of his penances); he was superior to Bṛhaspati and Śukra; and how Vyāsa had procreated him upon the soil of Vicitravīrya; he was Dharma in consequence of his practices of <i>dhāraṇā</i> and <i>dhyāna</i>; from Dharma also Yudhiṣṭhira took his birth. Vyāsa says that he has come to show a wonderful effect of his own penances: “what dost thou wish to see, or ask, or hear?” (XV, <b>28</b>)."
