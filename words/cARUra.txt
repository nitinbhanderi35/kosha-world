Kaṃsa had employed as his body-guards many pugilists—Pralaṃbaka, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta, Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśi, Dhenuka, Agha and Vivida and these pugilists were sent with Pūtanā to Gokula to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa. On the death of Pūtanā they returned to Mathurā. When Kaṃsa invited Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were the chief pugilists entrusted with the duty of killing Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa fought with Cāṇūra and Balabhadra with Muṣṭika. Both Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were killed. (Bhāgavata Daśama Skandha)."
