The Sun appeared before her and gave her some dates and asked her to prepare food with them and bring them back. Bālāvatī began to cook the dates. Though all the faggots she had gathered were consumed it was not properly boiled. As there was no more firewood she put her leg into the oven. Seeing this the SunGod was pleased and said “All your wishes will be realized”. From that day onwards that place was called by the name ‘Bālāpa’. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 152)."
