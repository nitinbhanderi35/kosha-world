Jatuveśmākhya[ṃ parva].) § 213: <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> briefly related the plan of <i>Saubala, Duryodhana, Duḥśāsana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra</i> to burn the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kuntī</i> in a lac-house, and their escape. Asked by <i>Janamejaya</i>, he then began to relate it more fully. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> frustrated all the plans of murdering them laid by <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., without speaking of them, in obedience to the counsels of <i>Vidura</i>. People began to speak in all public places of installing <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> on the throne instead of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Duryodhana</i> represented to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> that this would for ever exclude himself and his brothers from the throne (I, <b>141</b>). <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana, Karṇa, Śakuni</i>, and <i>Duḥśāsana</i> held a consultation together, and <i>Duryodhana</i> prevailed upon <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> to exile the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to <i>Vāraṇāvata</i> (“<i>Aśvatthāman</i> is on my side; with him follow <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Kṛpa; Vidura</i> is dependent on us for his means of life, though he is covertly with the foe”) (I, <b>142</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers began gradually to win over the people to their side by grants of wealth and honours, while <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> suggested to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to visit the festival of <i>Paśupati</i> at <i>Vāraṇāvata</i>. Fully understanding the motives of <i>Dhṛtarāṣtra, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> let <i>Bhīṣma, Vidura, Droṇa, Bāhlīka, Somadatta, Kṛpa</i>, <i>Aśvatthāman, Bhūriśravas, Gāndhārī</i>, etc., give them their benedictions, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> having performed propitiatory rites in order to obtain the kingdom, set out for <i>Vāraṇāvata</i> (I, <b>143</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> prevailed upon <i>Purocana</i> to reach <i>Vāraṇāvata</i> that very day upon a swift chariot, and to construct a house of inflammable materials and burn the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kuntī</i> (I, <b>144</b>). The people, who were distressed by the departure of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and angry with <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, were calmed by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura</i>, in obscure words (cf. <i>Mlecchavācā</i>, v. 5803), warned <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who explained the meaning to <i>Kuntī</i>. They set out on the 8th day of the month of <i>Phālguna</i> when <i>Rohiṇī</i> was ascendant (I, <b>145</b>). They were received with great honours by the citizens of <i>Vāraṇāvata</i> and installed by <i>Purocana</i> first in a palace that had been built for them, and after ten days in the lac-house called <i>Śiva (Śivākhyaṃ). Yudhiṣṭhira</i> scented the smell of fat, etc., and told it to <i>Bhīma</i>, but resolved to seem unsuspicious (I, <b>146</b>). A miner, sent by <i>Vidura</i>, told <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that <i>Purocana</i> would put fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the dark lunation, and made a large subterranean passage (I, <b>147</b>). They lived there for a year. Then on a certain night <i>Kuntī</i> fed a large number of <i>brahmans</i>; and there came also a <i>Niṣāda</i> woman with her five sons, who became intoxicated and lay down in the house to sleep. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> then set fire to the house and burnt <i>Purocana</i> and the <i>Niṣādas</i>, while they themselves escaped through the subterranean passage and fled in haste, <i>Bhīma</i> carrying his mother and brothers (cf. III, v. 546 foll.). The citizens thought they had been burnt to death (I, <b>148</b>). A person sent by <i>Vidura</i> took the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kuntī</i> to the other side of the <i>Gaṅgā</i> in a boat (I, <b>149</b>). The miner had covered the hole he had dug with ashes, and the townspeople thought that the <i>Niṣāda</i> woman with her five sons were <i>Kuntī</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and sent to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> to inform him that they had been burnt to death together with <i>Purocana. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> wept in deep sorrow, and caused the funeral rites to be performed. Meanwhile the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> having crossed the <i>Gaṅgā</i> proceeded in the darkness to the south and reached a dense forest. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> then prevailed upon <i>Bhīma</i> to carry <i>Kuntī</i> and his brothers (I, <b>150</b>). The motion of <i>Bhīma's</i> legs raised a wind like that of the months of <i>Śuci</i> and <i>Śukra</i>, while he trod down the trees and swam across streams. Towards evening they sat down in a terrible forest under a banyan-tree. <i>Kuntī</i> was thirsty, and <i>Bhīma</i> proceeded to a pool at a distance of a <i>gavyūti</i>, and brought water by soaking his upper garments. When he found them sleeping from fatigue, he lamented that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> would not yet allow him to slay <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., and sat there awake keeping watch over them (I, <b>151</b>)."
