            "content": "PARVATA II¦. It is believed that in Kṛtayuga all mountains had wings. They flew all over the world with the swiftness of Garuḍa or Vāyu. All beings including ṛṣis and devas lived in a state of suspense since at any moment any mountain might fly and land down on their heads. They complained to Indra and Indra asked the mountains to remain at one place which they flatly refused. Indra got angry and started cutting down the wings of the mountains with his Vajrāyudha. No mountain was able to escape from this punishment; but Vāyubhagavān carried away his bosom friend, the mountain Maināka, and put it in the ocean without anybody noticing it. So Maināka alone did not lose its wings. It was this Maināka which rose from the ocean and gave a resting point to Hanūmān, son of Vāyu, when he took a leap from the shores of Bhārata to Laṅkā. This was but an expression of gratitude to Vāyu whose son Hanūmān was, for the help he had given when Indra was cutting off the wings of all mountains. (Sarga 1, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa)."
