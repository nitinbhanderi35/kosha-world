The word Midu is a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Mṛdu<sup>504</sup> which means soft, delicate or beautiful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo<sup>505</sup> takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla, Bilāḍa and Bilāla as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. According to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow) current in Bengal.<sup>506</sup> D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic caste like vardhaki (carpenter).<sup>507</sup> We find the word Vilāla occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has been translated by the editor of the grant as follows: <dvsn n='P'/>(a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla <dvsn n='P'/>(b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla <dvsn n='P'/>(c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy pond of Gaṇeśvara. <dvsn n='P'/>All the three names have been explained according to their context in this work. <dvsn n='P'/>In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvilāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī. Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.<sup>508</sup> The whole sense of the name ‘Miduvilāla’ is not clear."
