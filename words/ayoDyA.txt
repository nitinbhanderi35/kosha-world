            "content": "AYODHYĀ¦. A city in North India which enjoyed great importance and reputation for many years as the capital of the Kings of the solar dynasty. (See Ikṣvāku dynasty). All the Kings of this dynasty ruled the country from this city as their capital. Vasiṣṭha, the great preceptor of the Ikṣvāku Rājas, came to Ayodhyā during the period of the reign of Kalmāṣapāda, who was the thirty-fifth ruler in succession to Ikṣvāku. A quarrel broke out between Kalmāṣapāda and Vasiṣṭha during a hunting expedition, and Vasiṣṭha cursed the King and as the result the latter became a Rākṣasa. After regaining his former form as King, he apologised to Vasiṣṭha and they became friends again. At the request of the King in the interests of his dynasty Vasiṣṭha came to Ayodhyā, and the people were greatly elated. A son was born to Vasiṣṭha by Kalmāṣapāda's wife and that son was Aśmaka. After that Vasiṣṭha used to go to Ayodhyā frequently and was installed as family preceptor of the Ikṣvākus. Till the time of Śrī Rāma the city of Ayodhyā maintained its pomp and glory, and after that gradually its decay and fall set in. Laudatory references to the city are found in most of the Purāṇas like the Mahābhārata, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa etc. (See Kosala)."
