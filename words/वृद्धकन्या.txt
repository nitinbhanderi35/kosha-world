She worshipped the <i>Pitṛs</i> and the gods with fasts and practised penances in that solitary forest not wishing to marry, as she did not see a husband worthy of her. When she could no longer move, she set her heart upon departing for the other world. <i>Nārada</i> told her that she had no regions of blessedness to obtain, not having cleansed herself by the rite of marriage. She then went to a concourse of <i>ṛṣis</i>, and said that she would give half her penances to him who would accept her hand in marriage. <i>Gālava's</i> son, the ṛṣi <i>Prākśṛṅgavat</i>, accepted her hand on condition that he should live with her only one night. On that night she became a young lady of the finest complexion, etc., and <i>Gālava's</i> son became very happy. At morn she said: “he that will, with rapt attention, pass one night in this tīrtha after having gratified the gods with oblations of water, shall obtain the merit of the vow of <i>brahmacarya</i> for 58 years,” and then she departed for heaven. He soon followed her, moved by sorrow: IX, <b>52</b>, 3003."
