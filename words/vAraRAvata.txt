It is believed that the modern village Varṇava, 19 miles north east to Meerut in North India, is the place where this Purāṇic Vāraṇāvata stood. Information about Vāraṇāvata found in Mahābhārata, is given below; <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Once the ministers of Dhṛtarāṣṭra made a consultation about the festival in this city. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 192, Stanza 3). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Vāraṇāvata was one of the five villages requested for by the Pāṇḍavas, on their return after their life in the forest. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 19). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Yuyutsu, the son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, carried on a battle here for six months. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 58)."
