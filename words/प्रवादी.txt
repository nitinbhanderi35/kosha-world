So <lang>Tib.</lang> seems clearly to understand: <tib>chos sbyor ḥdi ḥdra ḥdi la rab tu rtsod pa stoṅ</tib>, which definitely opposes taking pravādi as <lex>loc.</lex> for °de; this construction would in any case be difficult, since śūnyā could then not agree with this word (as <lang>Tib.</lang> makes it and as natural interpretation requires); to take śūnyā with bhūmir in <ab>prec.</ab> line would be forced. No <ab>v.l.</ab> is recorded for pravādi (<ed>Calc.</ed> with some <ab>mss.</ab> reads śūnya-); perhaps it should be <ab>em.</ab> to °da (<ab>n. sg.</ab>, for °daḥ)."
