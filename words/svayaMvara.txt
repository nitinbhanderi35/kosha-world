            "content": "SVAYAṂVARA II¦. A Kṣatriya custom of princesses selecting their husbands themselves. There are three kinds of Svayaṃvara. These three types are stipulated for Kings only. The first type is Icchāsvayamvara, the second one is Savyavasthāsvayaṃvara and the third is Śauryaśulkasvayaṃvara. No condition is attached to Icchāsvayaṃvara. Anybody may be chosen as husband according to the wish of the bride. Damayantī Svayaṃvara is an example of this. In the second it will be stipulated that the bridegroom will have to possess certain qualifications. In Sītā-Svayaṃvara Śrī Rāma drew the bow of Tryambaka, and married Sītā. This is an example of the second type of Svayaṃvara. The third type is meant for adventurous heroes. Arjuna's marrying Subhadrā is an example of the third type of Svayaṃvara. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 3)."
