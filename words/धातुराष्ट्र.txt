One <ab>mg.</ab> of <lang>Skt.</lang> dhātu is <i>metal</i> or <i>mineral</i>; if that is the <ab>mg.</ab> here, the <ab>cpd.</ab> might be rendered <i>adorned with kingdoms characterized by minerals</i>. I am very doubtful of this interpretation, but have no guess which seems to me plausible as to what <b>dhātu</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab>, means here."
