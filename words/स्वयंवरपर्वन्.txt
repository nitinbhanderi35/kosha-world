The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> went to the <i>Pāñcāla</i> land in the company of <i>brahmans</i>, who told them of the <i>svayaṃvara</i>, and of <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i>, and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> (I, <b>184</b>). On their way they beheld <i>Dvaipāyana</i>. They took up their quarters in the house of a potter, and adopting the brahmanical profession, they began to lead a mendicant life. <i>Yajñasena</i> (= Drupada) always cherished the wish of bestowing his daughter on <i>Kirīṭin</i> (i.e. Arjuna), but never spoke of this wish to anybody. He therefore caused a very stiff bow to be made, which was incapable of being bent by anybody except <i>Arjuna</i>; and causing some machinery to be erected in the sky, he set up a mark attached to that machinery, and said: “He who with this bow and these arrows hits the mark shall obtain my daughter.” Among the kings that came were <i>Duryodhana</i> and the <i>Kurus</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>. The princes entered the arena by the north-eastern gate (<i>śiśumāraśiraḥ prāpya</i>). The arena was situated to the north-east of the capital (description of it). On the 16th day <i>Draupadī</i>, having bathed, entered the arena. Then the <i>purohita</i> of the <i>Somakas</i> gratified <i>Agni</i>. <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, possessing a voice deep as that of a kettledrum or of the clouds, taking hold of his sister's arm, stood in the midst of the arena, and said: “Hit the mark by means of these five arrows.” Then he addressed his sister, reciting to her the names, etc. of the assembled princes (I, <b>185</b>).—§ 232. Enumeration (α) of the assembled princes (I, <b>186</b>).—§ 233. There came also the <i>devagaṇas</i> on their chariots; the <i>Rudras</i> and the <i>Ādityas</i>, the <i>Vasus</i> and the <i>Aśvins</i>, the <i>Sādhyas</i> and all the <i>Maruts</i>, with <i>Yama</i> and <i>Dhaneśvara</i> (i.e. Kubera) walking ahead; and also the <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Suparṇas</i>, the <i>mahoragas</i>, the <i>Devarṣis</i>, the <i>Guhyakas</i> and the <i>Cāraṇas, Viśvāvasu, Nārada</i> and <i>Parvata</i>, the principal <i>Gandharvas</i> with the <i>Apsarases</i>, and the <i>Asuras</i> and <i>Siddhas</i> (v. 7017), and <i>Halāyudha</i> (i.e. Balarāma), and <i>Janārdana</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇa), and the chiefs of the <i>Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas</i>, and <i>Yadus</i>, always obedient to Kṛṣṇa. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> pointed out the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to his brother <i>Rāma</i>. When <i>Duryodhana</i>, the <i>Cedi-</i> king <i>Śiśupāla</i> (son of <i>Damaghoṣa</i>), <i>Jarāsandha</i>, the <i>Madra-</i> king <i>Śalya</i>, etc. had in vain tried to string the bow, and <i>Karṇa</i>, though having succeeded in stringing it, had, as a <i>sūta</i>, been rejected by <i>Kṛṣṇā, Jiṣṇu</i> (i.e. Arjuna) came forward (I, <b>187</b>). Some of the brahmans spoke reproachingly of <i>Arjuna's</i> daring undertaking, some approved of it (citing <i>Paraśurāma</i> and <i>Agastya's</i> drinking out of the Sea). <i>Arjuna</i>, bending his head to <i>Īśāna</i> and remembering <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, accomplished the task. The gods showered celestial flowers. <i>Drupada</i> was filled with joy. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with the twins returned home. <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> approached <i>Arjuna</i>, who soon afterwards left the lists followed by her (I, <b>188</b>).—§ 234. When <i>Drupada</i> expressed his desire of bestowing his daughter on that <i>brahman</i>, the kings resolved to slay <i>Drupada</i> and burn <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, but spare <i>Arjuna</i>, whom they took for a <i>brahman</i>. They rushed at <i>Drupada</i>, who was defended by <i>Arjuna</i> with the bow and by <i>Bhīma</i> with a tree torn up by the root. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> then knew, and said to <i>Balarāma</i> that they must be the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, who had escaped from the fire (I, <b>189</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> was defeated by <i>Arjuna</i> (“accomplished in the <i>Brāhma</i> and the <i>Paurandara</i> weapons”, v. 7105), and the <i>Madra-</i>king <i>Śalya</i> by <i>Bhīma</i>; then <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., who had been engaged with the <i>brahmans</i>, desisted from the combat, because <i>brahmans</i>, though offending, should yet always be protected. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said to them that those <i>brahmans</i> had justly acquired the maiden. The kings returned to their respective kingdoms. <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, with difficulty, escaped from the throng, followed by <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>.—§ 235. <i>Kuntī</i> was filled with anxiety, seeing that her sons were late in returning from their begging tour. Then, in the late afternoon, <i>Jiṣṇu</i> (i.e. Arjuna), accompanied by a body of <i>brahmans</i>, entered the abode of the <i>Bhārgava</i> (i.e. the potter, Nīl.) (I, <b>190</b>). <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> presented <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> as their “alms”, and <i>Kuntī</i>, not yet seeing them, said: “enjoy ye all.” Afterwards, she was alarmed at what she had said. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> declared that <i>Arjuna</i> should wed her; but <i>Arjuna</i> replied that it was a sin for the younger brother to marry before the elder. Meanwhile, they all fell in love with <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> recollected the words of <i>Vyāsa</i>, and, from fear of a division amongst the brothers, said that she should be the common wife of them all. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Balarāma</i> then paid them a visit, and again went away (I, <b>191</b>).—§ 236: When <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> were turning towards the abode of the <i>Bhārgava, Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i> followed them and concealed himself in some part of the house. Then <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> and the twins returning from their begging tour in the evening, gave everything to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Kuntī</i> caused <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> to distribute it, giving to <i>Bhīma</i> alone as much as to all the others, because he always ate much. Then they laid down for the night, and <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i> overheard their conversations. In the morning <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> set out to report it to <i>Drupada</i>, who was sad, because he did not know, if perhaps a man of mean descent had taken away his daughter, though he thought it possible that it was Arjuna (I, <b>192</b>)."
