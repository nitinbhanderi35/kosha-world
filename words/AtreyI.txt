Aṅgiras always spoke rudely to her and pained at this she once approached her father and told him about this. Her father told her thus: “Your husband is the son of Agni. That is why he appears unbearable to you. Therefore give him a cold bath always and he would gradually become mild.” Hearing this the devout Ātreyī transformed herself into a river and started to cool him down by constant showers. This river later on became the famous Paruṣṇī Nadī. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa)."
