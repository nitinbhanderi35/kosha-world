He has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāhmaṇa Devaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun. <dvsn n='P'/>It is an abbreviated name with the ending <i>“ika”</i><sup>12</sup> like Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika for Chandodatta.<sup>13</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’<sup>14</sup> cannot be derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit term Dardara,<sup>15</sup> meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly region. <dvsn n='P'/>We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddarapabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.<sup>16</sup> The <i>Daddarapabbata</i> may be identified with the mountainous tract of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls the river <i>Dāradī Sindhuḥ.</i><sup>17</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The people of this tract, the <i>Daradas</i> are mentioned in the Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's <i>āśrama.<sup>18</sup></i> The Daradas are the people, living above Peshawar.<sup>19</sup> But the basic weakness in the suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia<sup>20</sup> is, as he himself admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. <dvsn n='P'/>It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are synonyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī, or a brāhmaṇa-woman.<sup>21</sup> These are deśya words and hence refer to local elements. <dvsn n='P'/>In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credulous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped. Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.<sup>22</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. <i>‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’</i> or <i>‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’</i> a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also used in satire. <dvsn n='P'/>It is interesting to note that <i>Ḍaḍḍa</i> is also an English slang word meaning ‘a foolish person’."
