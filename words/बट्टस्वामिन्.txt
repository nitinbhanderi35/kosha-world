It is a title of respect but is also affixed to the names of learned brāhmaṇas. Here it has been used as the first part of the name while in other examples we find it used as a second part of the name. Bhaṭṭasvāmin is also the name of the author of a commentary on the Arthaśāstra. The whole name literally means ‘the lord of lords’."
