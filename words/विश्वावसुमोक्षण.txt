Rāmopākhyānap.). <i>Jaṭāyu</i> (brother of <i>Sampāti</i> and son of Aruṇa and friend of Daśaratha) attacked <i>Rāvaṇa</i>, who cut off his wings. <i>Rāvaṇa</i> entered <i>Laṅkā</i> (built by Viśvakṛt) with <i>Sītā. Jaṭāyu</i> indicated to <i>Rāma (Kākutṣa</i>) and <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> that <i>Rāvaṇa</i> had gone towards the south, and then he died. <i>Rāma</i> caused his funeral obsequies to be duly performed. <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> killed a <i>Rākṣasa</i> named <i>Kabandha</i>, from whose body there came out a celestial person, viz. the <i>Gandharva</i> prince <i>Viśvāvasu</i>, who had been cursed by a brahman; he directed them to <i>Sugrīva</i> (brother of the monkey king <i>Vālin</i>), who dwelled at the lake <i>Pampā</i>, near the mountain <i>Ṛṣyamūka</i>, with his four counsellors; then he disappeared (III, <b>279</b>)."
