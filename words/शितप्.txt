            "content": "the syllable ति applied to the Vikarana-ending form of a root to denote a root for a grammatical operation. The specific men tion of a root with श्तिप् added, shows that the root of the particular class or conjugation shown, is to be taken and not the same root belonging to any other conjugation; cf. इक्श्तिपौ धातुनिर्देशे; e.g. अस्यतिवक्तिख्यातिभ्योऽङ् P.III. 1. 52. Although operations prescribed for a primary root are applicable to a frequentative root when the frequentative sign य has been omitted, operations prescribed for a root which is stated in a rule with ति (श्तिप्) added to it, do not take place in the frequentative roots;cf. श्तिपा शपानुबन्धेन ... पञ्चैतानि न यड्लुकि."
