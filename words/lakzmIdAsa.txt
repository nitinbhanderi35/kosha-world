This Mana (house) was near the temple of Tṛppūtamaṅgala in Vellārappilly in Cochin (Kaṇayannūr taluk). The Kariṅgāmpilly Mana was bearing the position of Taliyātiri in the village of Irāṇikkula. It is over two hundred years since that Mana became extinct. (The houses of Namboothiri brahmins are called Manas). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) It is believed that the famous ‘Śukasandeśa’ was written in 112 M.E. There is one set of historians who hold that it was written in 666 A.D. But the famous scholar and poet Ullūr states with authority that it was written in the 10th or 11th century A.D. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Stories about this poet.</i> As usual there are legends regarding this poet also. That the poet was a very dull boy in his childhood and that he became bright and brilliant by the blessings of his guru is one legend. After writing his Śukasandeśa the poet went on a pilgrimage in South India. One night he came to a brahmin's house but was not given any food or a place to sleep. He slept in an open veranda on the outside. He was lying awake when he heard his ‘Śukasandeśa’ being read inside by a few people. At a stage they were not able to follow the import of a verse when Lakṣmīdāsa shouted the meaning from outside. A door opened and a voice enquired in Tamil “Are you Kariṅgāmpilly?” When he said yes they were extremely happy and took him inside and treated him with respect. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Works.</i> No major work other then Śukasandeśa has been found. Two small poems are available. <dvsn n='NI'/>Śukasandeśa has been written on the model of the famous Meghasandeśa of Kālidāsa. Many commentaries on this have come to light; of these the one written by Mānavedan Rāja of Kozhikode Palace named Vilāsinī is the best. Other commentaries named Varavarṇinī, Cintātilaka and Vyākṛti are also worth mentioning."
