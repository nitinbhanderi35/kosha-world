A hermit King born in the family of Pūru. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Genealogy.</i> Descended from Viṣṇu in the following order:—Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas— Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti—Pūru—Janamejaya—Prācinvān -Pravīra—Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvidha -Saṃyāti—Rahovādi—Raudrāśva—Matināra— Santurodha—Duṣyanta—Bharata—Suhotra—Bṛhatputra -Ajamīḍha—Jahnu. <dvsn n='NI'/>Ajamīḍha had three wives, Dhūminī, Nīlī and Keśinī. Ṛkṣa was born from Dhūminī, Duṣyanta and Parameṣṭhi from Nīlī and Jahnu from Keśinī. The descendants of Jahnu are called the Kuśikas. Jahnu handed over his kingdom to his son Balākāśva and went to perform penance. Kuśika was the son of Balākāśva. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Drank up the river Ganges.</i> The river Gaṅgā, which flowed through the earth in accordance with the request of Bhagīratha, submerged the hermitage of Jahnu. Jahnu became angry at this haughtiness of Gaṅgā and drank up the river, but at the entreaty of Bhagīratha pushed Gaṅgādevī out through his ear. (See under Gaṅgā). From that day onwards Gaṅgā got the name Jāhnavī."
