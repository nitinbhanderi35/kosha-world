According to Sāyaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the compound denotes a ‘driver out of cows.’ Perhaps it means a ‘tormentor of cows,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. Weber<sup>3</sup> renders it as ‘knacker of cows,’ Eggeling as ‘one who approaches cows.’ <dvsn n='P'/>^4 <i>Sacred Books of the East,</i> 44, 416. <F>1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1. <i>Cf.</i> Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4.</F> <F>2) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, <i>loc. cit.</i></F> <F>3) <i>Indische Streifen,</i> 1, 82, n. 11.
