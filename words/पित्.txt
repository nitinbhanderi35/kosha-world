III. 1.4. A Sarvadhātuka affix, marked with the mute consonant प्, in Pāņiņi's Grammar has been described as instrumental in causing many operations such as (a) the substitution of guņa; (cf P. VII. 3 84,91). (b) the prevention of guņa in the case of a reduplicative syllable as also in the case of the roots भू and सू (cf. P. VII. 3.87, 88); (c) the substitution of Vŗddhi, (cf. P. VII. 3.89, 90), (d) the augments इ and ई in the case of the roots तृह् and ब्रू respectively (cf. P. VII. 3.92, 93, 94), and (e) acute accent for the vowel preceding the affix in the case of the roots भी,हृी,भृ and others (cf. P. VI. 1.192). A short vowel (of a root) gets त् added to it when followed by a kŗt affix marked with प्ः e.g., विजित्य​, प्रकृत्य, etc.:(cf. P. VI. 1.71)."
