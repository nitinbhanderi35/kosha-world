The destruction of the earth by water. ‘A hundred thousand years previous to the destruction of the earth by water, a Deva appears to warn all the beings concerned of the event, as when it is destroyed by fire; a cloud forms at the same time in a Kela-laksha of Sakwalas and after raining for a short time disappears. After an immense interval another cloud appears, and the rain called Khārodaka begins to fall; at first in small drops, but gradually increasing in size until they are as large as a palm tree; this rain is so acrid that it dissolves entirely the earth and all things connected with it’ (Spence Hardy, Manual of Buddhism p. 32). E. अपस् and संवर्त."
