(See under Divodāsa also). <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>General.</i> One of the oldest and most popular sacred centres in India, Kāśī is reputed for its Viśvanātha temple of hoary traditions, according to one of which the Śivaliṅga in the temple was installed by Brahmā himself. (Hālāsya Māhātmya). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Pilgrimage on foot to Kāśī.</i> Devotees from many parts of India go on pilgrimage to Kāśī on foot, bathe in the holy waters of the Gaṅgā and thus earn spiritual satisfaction and release from worldly attachments. The reason for the above is stated in the Agni Purāṇa as follows:— Once, at Kailāsa Śiva told Pārvatī that the temple at Kāśī was called ‘Avimukta’ (unreleased) as it never perished, and all Japa, tapa, homa and dāna made there never cease to give auspicious results. One should walk on foot to Kāśī and live there. Having gone there one should never leave the place. There are eight great tīrthas at Avimukta, i.e. Hariścandra tīrtha, Āvrātakeśvara tīrtha, Japyeśvara tīrtha, Śrī Parvatīrtha, Mahālayatīrtha, Bhṛgu tīrtha, Caṇḍeśvara tīrtha and Kedāratīrtha. These tīrthas extend to two yojanas to the east of the Kāśī temple and half-ayojana to the west of it. The river Varaṇā is also there, and Vārāṇasī is at the centre of all these. Whatever is done at Vārāṇasī like bath, Japa, homa, worship of Devas, dāna, obsequies for the dead, oneself living there etc. is productive of devotion and salvation. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 112). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>References to Kāśī in the Mahābhārata.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Pāṇḍu once conquered Kāśī.
