It was the time of Devāsura war. A great army of asuras under the leadership of Andhaka attacked Devaloka and conquered it. In the great battle with Andhaka the Vajrāyudha of Indra broke into two. Indra was thinking of a new weapon for him. Mahāviṣṇu then appeared before him and advised him to praise the glory of Agni. Indra did so and then a divine weapon rose from the fire. Indra flew at the asuras carrying the new weapon. There was no clever charioteer to drive the chariot of Indra. Still, seated in the golden chariot given to him by the Vasus Indra drove very swiftly against the asuras. The earth shivered by the din of the chariotwheels. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the earth began to quake the sage Śamīka following directions of his wife Tapasvinī placed the child on the ground outside the hermitage. An astrologer had told her that a child would become two if it was placed in an open ground at the time of earth-quake. Tapasvinī wanted one more child. As soon as her child was placed on the ground another child identical in every respect with the first one was born by the side of the other. But the second child, as soon as it was born rose up and ran to Indra for driving his chariot. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the Gandharvas knew he was coming to help Indra, they showered him with brilliance and the child approaching Indra said “Oh, Lord of the Devas, I shall be your charioteer.” Indra asked him, “Child, whose son are you? How will you drive my horse? I doubt your competence.” The child replied, “I am the son born to Śamīka on the ground. I have been given power and brilliance by the Gandharvas and so I am capable of driving your chariot.” On hearing this, Indra accepted him as his charioteer and named him Mātali."
