When they stood in the form of infants they were asked to create subjects. But they were the incarnation of ‘Sattva’, (the attribute of purity), and so were not prepared to undertake creation. Even at the age of four or five the four of them learned the Vedas, and travelled together. They were celibates for ever. While the Sanakādis were travelling thus one day they reached Vaikuṇṭha, and cursed Jaya and Vijaya who showed disrespect towards them. (See under Jayavijayas). <dvsn n='NI'/>It is mentioned in some places that the Sanakādis were the incarnations of portions of Mahāviṣṇu. Once Brahmā praised the incarnations of Viṣṇu. <dvsn n='NI'/>It is clear that the Kumāras (Sanakādis) had taken incarnation before the present Brahmā began the work of creation. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1; Skandha 7; Bhāgavata, Skandha 7, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa)."
