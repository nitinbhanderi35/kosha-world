Though he lived according to the spiritual advice of his preceptor Jaimini he was denied the sight of Viṣṇu. Ultimately Subāhu and his queen attained heaven as they listened to Vijvala, their second son, reciting hymns addressed to Vāsudeva. (Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 94). <dvsn n='NI'/>Though Subāhu and his queen worshipped Viṣṇu for a long time in the Ānanda forest, the lord did not appear to them. Ultimately they forsook their bodies in the forest and after a very long walk came to the abode of munis. The king queried them as to why he failed to see Viṣṇu though he performed penance for a very long time. The King and queen were done up due to hunger and thirst and the munis asked them to return to Ānandāśrama and eat the corpses left there. While they were accordingly eating the corpses, Vijvala questioned Kuñjala a bird which lived nearby, why his parents were eating dead bodies. The bird answered that when the King and queen had recited the praises of Vāsudeva they would see Viṣṇu. It also taught Vijvala songs in praise of Viṣṇu. After having studied the songs, Vijvala went and sat on a tree at ānandāśrama and sang the songs. Subāhu and his queen repeated them and immediately Viṣṇu appeared before them and conducted them to heaven."
