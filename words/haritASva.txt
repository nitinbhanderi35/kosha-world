In the art of music he defeated Nārada and shamed Sarasvatī (Goddess of language), pleased Brahmā and by the melody of his music sent Viṣṇu to sleep. The mounting achievements of the King in the art of music evoked jealousy in Śivaśaṅkara, the lord of music. When Śaṅkaramūrti in a competitive spirit played the rāga Śaṅkarābharaṇa (a particular tune) Haritāśva) pointed out that Śāntarasa (the calmness and poise) which was suited to that rāga had given place to raudra rasa which was a serious mistake. Enraged at this Śiva opened his eye of fire at the King who retorted boldly thus, ‘even if the eye of fire was opened a mistake was a mistake’. This stand of the King pleased Śiva so much that he bestowed on the King boons and good wishes as presents for his (king's) victory over all. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Killed Andhaka.</i> Andhakāsura conquered Svarga and took Indra prisoner during the period when Haritāśva was King. The combined efforts of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva could not kill Andhaka. At last at the instance of Bṛhaspati a representative of the Devas visited Haritāśva at Ayodhyā and sought his help to kill Andhaka and accordingly the King set out for war against the demon. Agastya told the King in secret that Andhaka treasured an image of Śiva and Pārvatī in his stomach, and after removing, with his arrows the idol from his stomach, Haritāśva killed him and restored the Deva-loka to Indra. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa)."
