Even from very ancient times the people of Bhārata believed in the sacredness of holy places and they considered a pilgrimage to holy places as a part and parcel of their life. Almost all the Purāṇas have praised the greatness of holy places. <dvsn n='NI'/>It is not true that all those who visit holy places and bathe in the sacred ponds there would get salvation. In Chapter 11 of Padma Purāṇa it is stated thus: <dvsn n='NI'/>He would get salvation whose limbs, mind, knowledge, austerity and fame are under his own control. He who lives clean in body, without egoism, contented and never accepting gifts for services done would get salvation by visiting holy places. He who would fast if he did not get food, whose organs of sense are all under control would get salvation if he visits holy places. He who is righteous, free from anger, treats all animate objects like himself would get salvation if he visits holy place. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once the great sage Cyavana told Prahlāda thus: “Only those who are pure in heart would get the benefit of visiting sacred places. It is a sin for others to do pilgrimage. The banks of Gaṅgā are crowded with villages and cities. Many types of people like Parayas, Fishermen, Vaṅgas, Khasas, Huns and Mlecchas live there. They bathe in the holy river and drink the holy water, but they do not get salvation because their mind and heart are not clean.” (4th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata)."
