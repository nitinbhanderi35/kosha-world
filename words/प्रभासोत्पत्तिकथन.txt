As <i>Soma</i> lived long with <i>Rohiṇī</i>, his other wives complained to <i>Dakṣa</i>, who got them reconciled. As <i>Soma</i>, however, still continued to live with <i>Rohiṇī</i> exclusively, his other wives once more approached <i>Dakṣa</i>, who now threatened to curse him. His threats were not, however, heeded, and when the wives complained a third time, <i>Dakṣa</i> cursed <i>Soma</i>, so that he was affected with phthisis. His sacrifices, etc., were in vain; the herbs became tasteless and failed to grow, etc. The gods prevailed upon <i>Dakṣa</i> to withdraw the curse on condition that <i>Soma</i> should behave equally towards all his wives, and bathe in the <i>tīrtha</i> (sc. <i>Prabhāsa</i>) where the <i>Sarasvatī</i> mingles with the ocean, and adore <i>Mahādeva</i> there; then he should during the one half of the month wane every day and during the other wax every day. Bathing there on the day of new moon, he was restored. <i>Dakṣa</i> told <i>Soma</i> not to disregard women and brahmans. <i>Prabhāsa</i> became the foremost of all <i>tīrthas; Soma</i> bathes there on every recurring day of the new moon and regains his form and beauty; thence comes its name <i>Prabhāsa</i>, because <i>Soma</i> there regained his effulgence (<i>prabhā</i>)."
