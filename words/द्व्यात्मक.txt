His queen was Kayādhu;<sup>1</sup> wanted to avenge his brother Hiraṇyākṣa's death;<sup>2</sup> the six sons born of his Asura Yoni were carried off by Yogamāyā's effort. They were again born of Devakī and killed by Kamsa;<sup>3</sup> lust after more territory;<sup>4</sup> in his previous birth an attendant of Hari. He was next born as Rāvaṇa and afterwards Caidya. Destroyed the whole world by fire and by sword all friends of Hari for the killing of his brother, consoled his wife and sons pointing to the old saying that to die at the hands of an enemy leads one to heaven and cited the story of Suyajña that it was no use to weep over the dead body. Then Ditī set her mind on the truth;<sup>5</sup> Hiraṇyakaśipu began austere penance in the Mandara hill and the fire of his penance spread far and wide and created fear in the Devas.

All gods except the Triad bowed to him;<sup>7</sup> father of four sons, chief of whom was Prahlāda whom he hated as he was a devotee of Hari. Śukra's sons Śaṇḍa and Marka were appointed to be his tutors to get a knowledge of Trivarga. This only increased Prahlāda's devotion. Hiraṇyakaśipu put it to some inborn defect of the boy. Means to kill the child by wild beasts, poison, fire and water were of no avail. He was bound by noose and imprisoned;<sup>8</sup> when he was absent in Mandara hill Indra harassed his followers and captured his queen with Prahlāda. Nārada asked him to release her, which he did.
