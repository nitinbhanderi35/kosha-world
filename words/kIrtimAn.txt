As a celestial voice had warned Kaṃsa that the eighth son of Devakī would kill him he had ordered that every child born to her should be taken to him. Accordingly the first-born son of Devakī was taken to him, but was returned to the parents as Kaṃsa thought that he was not his enemy. He was brought up under the name Kīrtimān. Afterwards Nārada visited Kaṃsa and explained to him about his former birth, the object of Kṛṣṇa's incarnation etc. This information so angered Kaṃsa that he got Vasudeva and Devakī chained in prison. Moreover he brought back the first-born son of Devakī and dashed him to death on a stone. Thus ended the life of Kīrtimān."
