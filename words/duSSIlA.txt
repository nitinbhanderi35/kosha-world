When Devadāsa had once gone to the palace on some business Duśśīlā hid her paramour, with the object of doing away with her husband, on top of the ceiling of her room. He killed Devadāsa while the latter was sleeping in the night. Next day when people gathered at her house she gave out the story that her husband was murdered by thieves. But the people got the true story about the death of Devadāsa from his four-year-old son and beat Duśśīlā to death. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Śaktiyaśolaṃbaka, Taraṅga 2)."
