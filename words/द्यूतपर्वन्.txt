Then <i>Vyāsa</i> with his disciples proceeded towards <i>Kailāsa. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> resolved to die in order that he might not be the cause of the destruction of the <i>kṣatriyas</i>, but called back from his intention by <i>Phālguna</i> (i.e. Arjuna), he took upon him the vow not to speak a harsh word to his brothers or to any of the kings. Then, having gratified the <i>Pitṛs</i> and gods, he entered his own palace, accompanied by his ministers (II, <b>46</b>).—§ 294: <i>Duryodhana</i>, accompanied by <i>Śakuni</i>, by and by beheld all the <i>sabhā</i>; he mistook a piece of crystal for water and drew off his clothes, mistook a lake for land and fell in, etc., and was laughed at by <i>Bhīma, Arjuna</i>, the twins, and the menials of the palace. Filled with wrath and jealousy he became pale, and returned to <i>Hāstinapura</i>, together with <i>Śakuni</i> (II, <b>47</b>). <i>Śakuni</i> told him to ask <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who was very fond of gambling and did not know how to play, to play at dice; then he (<i>Śakuni</i>), who was skilled in dice, would win his kingdom and prosperity for <i>Duryodhana</i> (II, <b>48</b>). <i>Śakuni</i> told <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> that <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> was pale and depressed; <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Duryodhana</i> the cause; <i>Duryodhana</i> told him that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> supported 88,000 <i>snātakas</i>, giving to each of them thirty slave-girls; that 10,000 other brahmans daily ate at his palace the best food off golden plates; that the king of <i>Kāmboja</i> sent to him innumerable skins, etc.; that the Ocean brought the <i>Vāruṇa</i> nectar to him in a vessel of copper, as the celestial wives (<i>amarastriyaḥ</i>) to <i>Indra</i>; that <i>Vāsudeva</i>, having brought an excellent conch, bathed him with sea-water brought in 1,000 jars of gold, etc., from the eastern, southern, and western oceans; that the conches, which were blown when 100,000 brahmans were fed, could be heard there almost incessantly, etc. <i>Duryodhana</i> proposed to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> to invite <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> to a game at dice with <i>Śakuni</i>, and prevented him from consulting <i>Vidura</i> till he had had a <i>sabhā</i> built. Then he ordered <i>Vidura</i>, who dissuaded him in vain, to invite <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura</i> in great sorrow went to <i>Bhīṣma</i> (II, <b>49</b>).—At the request of <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> related that <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, having ascertained the opinion of <i>Vidura</i> (<i>b</i>), sought to bring <i>Duryodhana</i> back from his purpose to play at dice; but <i>Duryodhana</i> would not give way, relating that the <i>Nīpas, Citrakas</i>, the <i>Kaukuras</i>, the <i>Kāraskaras</i>, and the <i>Lohajaṅghas</i> were like bondsmen in the house of <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i>, and that <i>Bhīma, Arjuna</i>, and <i>Draupadī</i> had laughed at his mistake regarding the crystal, etc. (II, <b>50</b>).—§ 295: <i>Duryodhana</i> enumerated to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> the articles brought as tribute from various peoples to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Yājñasenī</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇā) daily (during the <i>rājasūya</i>) took care that everybody, including the deformed and the dwarfs, had eaten before she herself took her meal. Only two peoples did not pay tribute to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, in consequence of their relationship by marriage, and the <i>Andhaka-Vṛṣṇis</i>, in consequence of their friendship (II, <b>52</b>).—§ 296: <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> continued to enumerate kings, etc., who waited upon <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> at the <i>rājasūya</i>. The Ocean brought that <i>Vāruṇa</i> conch (<i>śaikyaṃ</i>, “in a sling,” PCR., i.e. in a strap, cf. BR.), which <i>Viśvakarman</i> had constructed with 1,000 <i>niṣkas</i>, and which <i>Prajāpati</i> had in a former <i>kalpa</i> presented to <i>Indra</i>; with that conch <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> anointed (<i>abhiṣiktaḥ</i>) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. When the conches were blown, those among the kings who were weak fell down, and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, <i>Sātyaki</i>, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and <i>Keśava</i> laughed; then <i>Bībhatsu</i> (= Arjuna) gave to the principal brahmans 500 bullocks with horns plated with gold, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> obtained, like <i>Hariścandra</i>, such properity that he surpassed <i>Rantideva</i>, <i>Nābhāga, Yauvanāśva, Manu, Pṛthu Vainya, Bhagīratha, Yayāti</i>, and <i>Nahuṣa</i> (II, <b>53</b>).—§ 297: Continuation of the conversation between <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> (II, <b>54, 55</b>). —§ 298: As <i>Śakuni</i> recommended the match of dice and praised his own dexterity in gambling, and <i>Duryodhana</i> spoke reprovingly of <i>Vidura</i> on account of his fondness for the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc., <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> reluctantly caused the <i>sabhā</i> (called <i>Toraṇasphāṭikā</i>) to be built, with 1,000 columns adorned with gold and lapis lazuli, a <i>krośa</i> in length and breadth, and then ordered <i>Vidura</i> to bring <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and his brothers (II, <b>56, 57</b>). <i>Vidura</i> arrived at the palace of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and invited him. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, having learned that he should have to play with <i>Śakuni,-Viviṃśati</i>, <i>Citrasena, Satyavrata, Purumitra</i>, and <i>Jaya</i>, “the most desperate and terrible gamblers, always depending upon deceit,” was unwilling to come; but as he had made the vow never to refuse when challenged, he set out for <i>Hāstinapura</i> the next day with his relatives, <i>Draupadī</i>, brahmans, etc., riding on the chariot taken charge of (so BR.) by <i>Bāhlīka</i>, and when he had arrived he saluted <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa</i>, <i>Kṛpa, Aśvatthāman, Somadatta, Duryodhana, Śalya, Saubala</i>, <i>Duḥśāsana, Jayadratha</i>, etc., and <i>Gāndhārī</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (II, <b>58</b>). <i>Śakuni</i> exhorted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to gamble. <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> quoted <i>Asita Devala (b</i>), but he was obliged to assent; <i>Duryodhana</i> said that he himself would supply jewels, etc., and that it was for him that <i>Śakuni</i> would play (II, <b>59</b>). The play began, the stake being a wreath of pearls, which <i>Śakuni</i> won (II, <b>60</b>). <i>Śakuni</i> then won from <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> his treasury, slave-girls, serving-men, elephants, chariots, the <i>Gandharva</i> horses which <i>Citrasena</i> had given to <i>Arjuna</i>, his warriors, and <i>nidhis</i> (II, <b>61</b>). <i>Vidura</i>, addressing <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣtṛa</i>, quoted the words of <i>Kāvya</i>, and reminded him that among the <i>Bhojas</i> they had abandoned an unworthy (<i>asamañjasaṃ</i>) son; the <i>Andhakas, Yādavas</i>, and <i>Bhojas</i> had abandoned <i>Kaṃsa</i>, and when he had been slain by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> the whole tribe became glad for a hundred years; “[likewise] let <i>Arjuna</i> slay this <i>Suyodhana</i> at thy command”; he quoted what <i>Kāvya</i> said to the <i>Asuras</i> in order to induce them to abandon <i>Jambha</i>, and related how a king from greediness after gold killed some gold-vomiting fowls that dwelt in his house, and so destroyed both his present and future wealth (II, <b>62</b>). <i>Vidura</i> warned against the gambling, and suggested to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> rather to win the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> than their wealth, and to let <i>Śakuni</i>, the hill-king (<i>Pārvatīyaḥ</i>), return whence he came (II, <b>63</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> blamed <i>Vidura</i> for his partiality towards the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and said that he would only follow the advice of his own intellect. <i>Vidura</i> complained of the ingratitude of kings and their fondness of flattery (II, <b>64</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> lost his wealth, kine, horses, goats, and sheep, “from <i>Parṇāśā</i> to the eastern bank of the <i>Sindhu</i>,” his city, country, lands, and the wealth of all dwelling therein, except that of the brahmans, and all those persons themselves except the brahmans, the ear-rings and <i>niṣkas</i> and other ornaments of the princes who were present, then <i>Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, Bhīma</i>, himself, and <i>Draupadī</i>; now <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Vidura</i>, etc., all gave way to grief, but <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Karṇa, Duḥśāsana</i>, etc., were glad (II, <b>65</b>).—§ 299: <i>Duryodhana</i> ordered <i>Kṣattṛ</i> (i.e. <i>Vidura</i>) to bring hither <i>Draupadī</i> to sweep the chambers and stay with the servant maids; <i>Vidura</i> declared that having lost himself, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> could not lawfully stake <i>Draupadī</i>, and said: “A goat had once swallowed a knife, and when it was pierced by it the hunter placed the head of the animal on the ground, and when drawing the knife out he tore its throat frightfully; therefore do not swallow the wealth of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>” (II, <b>66</b>). Then <i>Duryodhana</i> ordered the <i>prā-</i> <i>tikāmin</i> (a <i>sūta</i>) to bring <i>Draupadī</i>; she ordered him to ask <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> whether he had lost himself or her first; as <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said nothing, <i>Duryodhana</i> ordered that <i>Draupadī</i> should come and put her question in the assembly; she sent the <i>sūta</i> back to the assembly saying that she would do what aged and virtuous persons would tell her; all sat without uttering a word; but <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sent a trusted messenger to <i>Draupadī</i>, directing that, although in consequence of her season having come she was attired in one piece of cloth only. she should come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly. <i>Duryodhana</i> again ordered the <i>prātikāmin</i> to bring her, and as he seemed irresolute, he asked <i>Duḥśāsana</i> to do so. As she would flee to the ladies' household, <i>Duḥśāsana</i> dragged her in by her hair, while she was praying to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Jiṣṇu</i> (i.e. <i>Arjuna</i>), who were <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> and <i>Nara</i>, and blaming <i>Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Vidura</i>, etc., for looking silently on this crime. As she was casting a glance upon her enraged lords, <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, dragging her still more forcibly, addressed her, “Slave! slave!” and laughed aloud, applauded by <i>Karṇa, Śakuni</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i>, while all the others were filled with sorrow. <i>Bhīṣma</i> declared himself to be unable to decide the question she had put. As she then asked the others present to decide it, <i>Duḥśāsana</i> spoke many harsh words, and <i>Bhīma</i>, looking at <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, gave way to wrath (II, <b>67</b>). <i>Bhīma</i> blamed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and ordered <i>Sahadeva</i> to bring fire, as he wanted to burn the hands of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, but <i>Arjuna</i> appeased him. <i>Vikarṇa</i> repeatedly appealed to those present to decide the question, and as they did not say one word, he declared that as <i>Yudhiṣṭhīra</i> must be regarded as of no authority, because he had shown himself addicted to the vice of gambling, etc., he regarded <i>Draupadī</i> as not won. All applauded him, except <i>Karṇa</i>, who maintained that she had been justly won, and as, contrary to the ordinance of the gods that a woman should have only one husband, she had five husbands, there was no impropriety in dragging her to the assembly, and even to uncover her. <i>Karṇa</i> then asked <i>Duḥśāsana</i> to take off the robes of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the attire of <i>Draupadī</i>. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> took off their upper garments, and <i>Duḥśāsana</i> began to drag off the attire of <i>Draupadī</i>. But as she thought of and cried to <i>Hari</i> (i.e. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>), <i>Dharma</i> continually covered her anew with excellent clothes. <i>Bhīma</i> swore that he would drink the blood of <i>Duḥśāsana</i>. All blamed <i>Duḥśāsana</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Vidura</i> exhorted the assembly to answer the question put by <i>Draupadī</i>, and related the dialogue of <i>Prahlāda</i> (q.v.) and <i>Āṅgirasa</i> (i.e. <i>Sudhanvan</i>) (§ 300).—§ 300: v. <i>Prahlāda</i>.—§ 301: The kings answered not a word, and <i>Karṇa</i> told <i>Duḥśāsana</i> to take away the slave-woman <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> to the inner apartments (II, <b>68</b>). Dragged by <i>Duḥśāsana, Draupadī</i> saluted the assembly, complained of being exposed to the gaze of the crowd, and again asked them to answer her question. <i>Bhīṣma</i> again declared himself unable to decide it, but thought <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> ought to decide it (II, <b>69</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> said to <i>Draupadī</i>: “Let thy husbands decide the question, and, by making <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> the just a liar, free thee from slavery.” <i>Bhīma</i> said that only his obedience to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and the admonitions of <i>Arjuna</i> retained him from killing the wretched sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Vidura</i> asked him to forbear (II, <b>70</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> exhorted <i>Draupadī</i> to choose a new husband among the sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i>, after having exhorted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to decide the question, uncovered his left thigh and showed it to <i>Draupadī. Bhīṣma</i> swore that he would break this thigh of his. <i>Vidura</i> warned them, and was of opinion that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had no right to stake her. <i>Duryodhana</i> said that if <i>Bhīma, Arjuna</i>, and the twins declared that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was not their master, then <i>Draupadī</i> should be free. <i>Arjuna</i> said that he was certainly their master before the play, “but having lost himself, let all the <i>Kauravas</i> judge whose master he could be after that.” Just then a jackal began to cry near the <i>agnihotra</i> of <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra</i>, and other terrible omens were heard. On that account <i>Gāndhārī</i> and <i>Vidura</i> remonstrated with <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, who blamed <i>Duryodhana</i> and granted a boon to <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>. She chose that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> should become free from slavery. As she was granted a second boon, she asked that <i>Bhīma</i> and his brothers with their chariots and bows should regain their liberty. She refused to ask a third boon (II, <b>71</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> praised <i>Draupadī</i> for having saved her husbands. <i>Bhīma</i> threatened to slay all his foes instantly, but was retained by <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (II, <b>72</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> sent <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with his brothers and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> upon their chariots to <i>Indra-</i> <i>prastha</i>, having asked him not to remember the harshness of <i>Duryodhana</i> (II, <b>73</b>)."
