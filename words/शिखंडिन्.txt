[Śikhaṇḍin was originally a female, being Amba born in the family of <lbinfo n='Dru+pada'/> Drupada for wreaking her revenge upon <lbinfo n='Bhi+shma'/> Bhishma; (see Amba). But from her very birth the girl was given out as a male child and brought up as such. In due course she was married to the daughter of Hiraṇyavarman, who was extremely sorry to find that she had got a veritable woman for her husband. Her father, therefore, resolved to attack the kingdom of Drupada for his having deceived him; but Śikhaṇḍin contrived, by <lbinfo n='practis+ing'/> practising austere penance in a forest, to <lbinfo n='ex+change'/> exchange her sex with a Yakṣa, and thus averted the calamity which threatened Drupada. Afterwards in the great <lbinfo n='Bhāra+tī'/> Bhāratī war he proved a means of killing <lbinfo n='Bhī+shma'/> Bhīshma, who declined to fight with a <lbinfo n='wo+man'/> woman, when Arjuna put him forward as his hero. He was afterwards killed by Aśvatthāman]."
