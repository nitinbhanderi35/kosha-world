Kirmīravadha). § 316: <i>Vidura</i> had heard it from the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and now related it to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>. Departing from <i>Hāstinapura</i> and travelling for three days and nights the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> reached the <i>Kāmyaka</i> wood. At midnight a man-eating <i>rākṣasa, Kirmīra</i>, brother of <i>Baka</i> and friend of <i>Hiḍimba</i>, obstructed their path with a lighted brand, and would avenge himself on <i>Bhīma. Kṛṣṇā</i> was afraid. <i>Dhaumya</i> destroyed his illusion by <i>rākṣasa</i>-destroying <i>mantras. Arjuna</i> stringed his bow <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>; but <i>Bhīma</i>, making him desist, fought with trees, etc., against <i>Kirmīra</i>, as the brothers <i>Vāli</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i> had done of yore for the sake of the same woman. At last <i>Bhīma</i> seized him with his arms and whirled him about and killed him. Then placing <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> in their front they set out for <i>Dvaitavana</i>. Having cleared the forest of its pest they began to live there. “Passing through the forest, I saw the body of the <i>rākṣasa</i>, and heard the story from the brahmans” (III, <b>11</b>)."
