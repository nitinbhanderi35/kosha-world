Dubreuil with Kothoor in Ganjam.<sup>608</sup> Banerjee counts Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their country.<sup>609</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>According to Fleet Koṭṭūr (from Koṭṭapura) being a very common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Koṭṭūra of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly Koṭṭūr in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the passes in the Anaimalai Hills.<sup>610</sup> R. Sathianathaier proposes to identify Koṭṭūra with Koṭṭūra near Tuni (E. Godavari district) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam<sup>611</sup> There is another Koṭṭūra in the Vizagapatam district.<sup>612</sup> But the generally accepted view is to identify it with Kothoor in Ganjam."
