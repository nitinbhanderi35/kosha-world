Arjunābhigamanap.). § 330: After some time <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> taught <i>Arjuna</i> in private the [Pratismṛti] science (<i>upaniṣad</i>, i.e. <i>rahasyavidyā</i>, Nīl.; <i>bráhman</i>) that would reveal the whole universe to him, and told him to practise severe austerities; <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (α), know the fourfold (<i>catuṣpāda) Dhanur-</i> <i>veda</i>, the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, etc.; all celestial weapons are in the possession of <i>Indra</i>, imparted to him by the celestials from fear of <i>Vṛtra</i>. Then <i>Arjuna</i> took up the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>, etc., blessed by brahmans, <i>Siddhas</i>, and invisible spirits (<i>bhūtāni</i>), and by <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> (she said: “Let no one amongst us be ever again born in the order of <i>kṣatriyas</i>, but as brahmans; it is my great grief that in the assembly <i>Duryodhana</i> called me a ‘cow’ (i.e. ‘to be enjoyed by many men,’ Nīl.); but the grief of parting with thee is far greater”), who wished him success from <i>Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ, Hrī, Śrī, Kīrti, Dhṛti</i>, <i>Puṣṭi, Umā, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī</i>, the <i>Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas</i>, the hosts (<i>gaṇān</i>) of the <i>Maruts</i>, the <i>Viśvedevas</i>, and the <i>Sādhyas</i>, and wished him safety from the spirits (<i>bhūte-</i> <i>bhyaḥ</i>) of the sky, earth, and heaven, and all other enemies; and having walked round (<i>pradakṣiṇaṃ kṛtvā</i>) his brothers and <i>Dhaumya</i>, he set out towards the north. All creatures left the path of <i>Arjuna</i>, who was urged by the desire of beholding <i>Indra (? yuktasyaindreṇa yogena</i>). He passed over many mountains, and reached <i>Himavat</i> in one day by means of his <i>yoga</i>; then he passed over <i>Gandhamādana</i>, etc., and reached <i>Indrakīla</i>, walking night and day untiringly. Here he was addressed by a voice in the skies, and beheld <i>Indra</i> in the guise of a brahman, who told him to throw away his bow as of no use there, as this was the abode only of peaceful brahmans, and advised him to wish for heavenly bliss (<i>lokāḥ</i>); but <i>Arjuna</i> only asked for the celestial weapons, which <i>Indra</i> said he should obtain when he had seen <i>Śiva</i> (<i>Tryakṣa, Śūladhara, Bhūteśa, Parameṣṭhin</i>). Then <i>Indra</i> disappeared, and <i>Arjuna</i> remained, devoted to <i>yoga</i> (III, <b>37</b>)."
