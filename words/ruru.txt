Descended from Viṣṇu in the following order: Brahmā-Bhṛgu-Cyavana-Pramati-Ruru. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Birth.</i> The beautiful Pulomā was the wife of Bhṛgu. Bhṛgu got the son Cyavana by Pulomā. Cyavana married Sukanyā the daughter of Śaryāti. A son named Pramati was born to them. The hermit Pramati married the beautiful damsel Pratāpī. Ruru is their son. He grew up to be a famous hermit. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 2). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Marriage.</i> Ruru happened to see the exceedingly beautiful Pramadvarā the daughter of Viśvāvasu by Menakā. The moment he saw her he fell in love with her. The father of Pramadvarā came to know of this and he decided to give her in marriage to Ruru. Preparations for the marriage were being made. One day during that time Pramadvarā who had been running here and there joyfully, was bitten by a snake and she fell down dead. Ruru instantly reached the spot. <dvsn n='NI'/>Ruru who was greatly sad and disappointed, got down to the Ganges and bathed. Then rinsing his mouth he took some water in his hand and said “By the favour of God I have acquired by my devotion and worship of gods, devotion and service to my teacher, by my scripture-study, my worship with Gāyatrī, my prayer, and meditation, my penance, my offerings to the holy fire, and my oblations, let her come to life. If she does not come to life, I will die in this Ganges water.” Making this prayer, making the gods witnesses he poured the water down. <dvsn n='NI'/>Immediately a messenger from heaven appeared in the sky and said that she would come to life again provided Ruru was prepared to give half of his life to her. Ruru agreed to it. Thus Pramadvarā came to life again and Ruru married her. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 2). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Hatred towards Serpents.</i> A relentless hatred grew up in the heart of Ruru against serpents, because a serpent had killed his wife. He wandered about destroying every serpent he come across. Finally when he confronted Ḍuṇḍubha he was given exhortations and good advices regarding righteousness by Ḍuṇḍubhla. (M.B. Ādi Parva Chapter 9, Stanza 19). Moreover it is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 12, that Ruru had taken a lively interest in the sacrifice of Janamejaya meant for the extermination of serpents."

The Devas who were defeated by Ruru ran to the Blue mountain and prostrated before the goddess Śakti, who had been doing penance there. This goddess Śakti had been born from the matted hair of Śiva. <dvsn n='NI'/>Ruru followed the Devas and reached the Blue mountain. When Devī saw Ruru and his mighty army a loud laugh burst out from her. From that laugh thousands of devilish figures came into existence. They completely annihilated the army of Ruru. After this Devī killed Ruru with the nail of her toe. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa)."
