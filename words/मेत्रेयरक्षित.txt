            "content": "a recognised scholar of Paaninis' grammar who belonged to the Eastern part of India and fourished in the beginning of the twelfth century. As it appears from the name Maitreya Raksita he appears to.have been a Buddhist grammarian. Subsequent writers in their works refer to him by the name Raksita alone, as also by the name Maitreya, but very rarely by the name Maitreya Raksita. He wrote many works on grammar of which the *tantrapradipa' a learned commentary on Jinendrabuddhi's Nyaasa on Kaasikaa was a reputed one, which, although available in a fragmentary manuscript form today, has been profusely quoted by prominent grammarians after him."
