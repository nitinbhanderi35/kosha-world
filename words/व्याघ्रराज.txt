He has been identified with the Vākāṭaka feudatory prince Vyāghra whose inscriptions have been found at Nach-ne-ki-talai and Ganj in Central India, who is also said to have been the ruler of the Ucchakalpa dynasty in Bundelkhand.<sup>39</sup> But an objection to this view is that he must be a ruler in Dakṣiṇāpatha as mentioned in our inscription and has accordingly been identified with the ruler of Mahā-vana, a synonym of Mahā-kāntāra, also called Jeypore forest in Orissa.<sup>40</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The name is based on the animal <i>Vyāghra,</i> or tiger implying that in Mahākāntāra his subordinate chiefs were like tigers and he was their ruler. The name is a good selection in the context of the fact that the region of Mahākāntāra is known to have been infested with tigers."
