There is a princess in Muktidvīpa called Rūpalatā. In beauty she will be a good match for you.” On hearing this Pṛthvīrūpa calling the court artist Kumāradatta to his side said “Paint a picture of mine and go along with these three sannyāsins to Muktidvīpa and give the painting in private to the princess there and also bring me an exact painting of hers.” <dvsn n='NI'/>The painter went to Muktidvīpa and the King coming to know of the talents of the artist Kumāradatta commissioned him to paint a picture of his daughter Rūpalatā. He did the work beautifully. The King was immensely pleased and he enquired if Kumāradatta had seen a suitable prince for Rūpalatā. Kumāradatta immediately showed him the portrait of Pṛthvīrūpa. The king found the prince extremely suitable and entrusted the artist himself with the task of negotiating the marriage with Pṛthvīrūpa. Kumāradatta returned to his King with the portrait of Rūpalatā and Pṛthvīrūpa was infatuated with the dazzling beauty of Rūpalatā. Before long the marriage of Pṛthvīrūpa with Rūpalatā was conducted in all grandeur. (Alaṅkāravatīlambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 1)."
