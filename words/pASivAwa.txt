The place got the name of Paśubhūmi because it is located near the birth place of Paśupati (Śiva). (Chapter 30, Śloka 9, Sabhā Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>PAŚUDĀ. A female follower of Subrahmaṇya. (Śloka 28, Chapter 46, Śalya Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>PĀŚUPATA I. An aged brahmin. (See under Virūpākṣa). <dvsn n='NI'/>PĀŚUPATA. II. The missile of Śiva. Arjuna during his exile in the forests performed penance to propitiate Śiva and got this missile from him. <dvsn n='NI'/>Śiva has a bow named Pināka. Pāśupata is the arrow that is used on that bow. Pināka is a serpent with the colours of a rainbow. It has seven heads and has fierce canine teeth. Poison flows from them always. The string of the bow is wound round the neck of Śiva. The arrow, bright like the sun and equal to the fire of death, is the Pāśupata. It will burn all that it touches. Neither Nārāyaṇāstra, Brahmāstra, Āgneyāstra nor Vāruṇāstra can stand against this. In times of old Śiva burnt the Tripuras (three cities of the notorious three demons) by this arrow. Even Brahmā and Viṣṇu could be killed by Pāśupata. (Chapter 14, Anuśāsana Parva). Devotees worship Pāśupata as a deity. If the Pāśupata mantra is recited once it will remove all obstacles from the way and if recited a hundred times it will end all your calamities and bring success in any war for you. <dvsn n='NI'/>PĀŚUPATA(S). The bhūtagaṇas (Spirits and devils attending on him) of Śiva as a class are called Pāśupatas. (Chapter 67, Vāmana Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>PAŚUSAKHA. Husband of Gaṇḍā, servant-maid of the saptarṣis. (See under Saptarṣis). <dvsn n='NI'/>PAṬACCARA. A place of habitation in ancient Bhārata. During Purāṇic times the people of this place migrated to south India because they were afraid of Jarāsandha. (Chapter 14, Sabhā Parva). Sahadeva, one of the Pāṇḍavas during his victory tour of the south, subdued the people of this place. The paṭaccaras fought against the Kauravas on the side of the Pāṇḍavas. (Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva). It was the paṭaccaras who stood at the back of the Krauñca Vyūha constructed by the Pāṇḍavas. (Chapter 50, Bhīṣma Parva)."
