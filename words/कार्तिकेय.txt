[Kārtikeya is the Mars or the god of war of the Indian mythology. He is the son of Śiva (but born without the direct intervention of a woman). Most of his epithets have reference to the <lbinfo n='circum+stances'/> circumstances of his birth. Śiva cast his seed into Agni (who had gone to the god in the form of a dove while he was enjoying Pārvatī's company), who being unable to bear it cast it into the Ganges; (hence Skanda is called Agnibhū, Gaṅgāputra). It was then transferred to the six <lbinfo n='Kṛt+tikās'/> Kṛttikās (when they went to bathe in the Ganges), each of whom therefore <lbinfo n='conceiv+ed'/> conceived and brought forth a son. But these six sons were afterwards mysteriously combined into one of extraordinary form with six heads and twelve hands and eyes, (hence he is called Kārtikeya, <lbinfo n='Shadāna+na'/> Shadānana, Ṣaṇmukha &c.). According to <lbinfo n='an+other'/> another account the seed of Śiva was cast by the Ganges into a thicket of reeds (Śara); whence the boy was called <lbinfo n='Śara+vaṇabhava'/> Śaravaṇabhava, or Śarajanman. He is said to have pierced the mountain Krauncha, whence his name Krauñcadāraṇa. He was the commander of the army of the gods in their war with Tāraka, a powerful demon <ab>q. v.</ab> whom he vanquished and slew; and hence his names Senānī and <lbinfo n='Tāraka+jit'/> Tārakajit. He is represented as riding a peacock.] <b>--Comp.</b> --प्रसूः <i><ab>f.</ab></i> Pārvatī, mother of Kārtikeya."
