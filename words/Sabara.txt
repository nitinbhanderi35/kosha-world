(Ādi Parva, Chapter 174, Verse 16). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) When Sātyaki annihilated the Kauravas the dead bodies of thousands of Śabaras were heaped on the battle-field. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 119, Verse 46). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) In early days the Śabaras lived in the kingdom of Māndhātā, their profession being murder and looting. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 13). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Śiva had once taken the form of forest-dwellers and Śabaras. (Anuśāsana Parva. Chapter 65, Verse 17). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Many Kṣatriyas lived for many years hidden in caves for fear of Paraśurāma, and as they had no association with kṣatriyas during the period, they became Śabaras. (Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapter 29, Verse 15)."
