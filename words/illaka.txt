Illaka had one day to go to another place and his wife wanted to accompany him. But, Illaka did not allow that and went alone. Then she waited at the gates looking towards the husband moving fast away. And, when he completely disappeared from sight she, who could not bear the separation, fell down on the spot and expired. Illaka heard about the death and without delay, he hurried back home. He placed the dead body of his wife on his lap and wept. Weeping thus he also expired. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka, Taraṅga I)."
