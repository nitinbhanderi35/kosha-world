Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> <i>Lomaśa</i> related: In the <i>Kṛta yuga</i>, when the primeval deity (<i>Ādidevaḥ purātanaḥ</i>) assumed the function of <i>Yama</i>, the creatures did not die, and multiplied to such a degree that the <i>Earth</i> sank 100 <i>yojanas</i>. She applied to <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (= Viṣṇu), who, in the shape of a boar with a single tusk (<i>ekaśṛṅga</i>), lifted her up by means of that. The gods, with the <i>ṛṣis</i>, became afraid of the agitation produced, but learnt the matter from <i>Brahmán</i>, and with him they went to <i>Nandana</i>, there <i>Viṣṇu</i> was sitting in the shape of a boar with <i>Śrīvatsa</i> on his breast, together with <i>Suparṇa</i>, and having seen him they returned home (III, <b>142</b>)."
