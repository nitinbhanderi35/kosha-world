After <i>Droṇa's</i> death the <i>Kuru</i> warriors in grief, with <i>Duryodhana</i> at their head, repaired to <i>Aśvatthāman</i>. <is>When night came</is> (!) they proceeded to their tents, but could not sleep (α); they (α) passed that night together in <i>Duryodhana's</i> tent, reflecting (β). When morning came they rose and performed their customary rites. Arranging their troops they proceeded to battle, making <i>Karṇa</i> their leader. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> also proceeded to battle. <i>Karṇa</i> fought for two days and was then slain by <i>Arjuna. Sañjaya</i> repaired to <i>Hāstinapura</i> and informed <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> of <i>Karṇa's</i> fall. <i>Janamejaya</i> inquired about <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and the details of the battle (VIII, <b>1</b>). <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: After the fall of <i>Karṇa, Sañjaya</i> set out that night for <i>Hāstinapura</i> and spoke with <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (γ) (VIII, <b>2</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> related the discouragement of the <i>Kuru</i> army after the fall of <i>Droṇa; Duryo-</i> <i>dhana's</i> spirited address; <i>Karṇa</i> was made generalissimo but slain by <i>Arjuna</i> on the second day (δ) (VIII, <b>3</b>). Hearing of <i>Karṇa's</i> fall in battle, <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> swooned away; he and the ladies were restored to their senses; <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> inquired whether <i>Duryodhana</i> was still alive; <i>Sañjaya</i> informed him of <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> slaughter (ε) (VIII, <b>4</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> recounted the names of those that had fallen and those that were still alive; <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> once more swooned away (ζ) (VIII, <b>5—7</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> lament for <i>Karṇa</i> (η) (VIII, <b>8</b>); <i>Sañjaya</i> endeavoured to comfort him; continuation of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> lament (θ) (VIII, <b>9</b>).—§ 605. THE SIXTEENTH DAY: After <i>Droṇa's</i> fall the <i>Kauravas</i>, having fled and been rallied by <i>Duryodhana</i>, fought for a long time with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (<i>Arjuna</i>). <is>On the approach of the evening twilight</is> (!) the <i>Kauravas</i> retired to their encampment; they held a consultation in the night; <i>Duryodhana</i> inquired of his counsellors as to what should next be done. <i>Aśvatthāman</i> suggested the installation of <i>Karṇa</i> as generalissimo (ι). <i>Duryodhana</i> offered <i>Karṇa</i> the command, which <i>Karṇa</i> accepted, promising to slay the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (κ). <i>Karṇa</i> was installed in the command and blessed by the brahmans, and ordered the troops to be arrayed at the rise of the sun (λ) (VIII, <b>10</b>). Beholding <i>Karṇa</i>, none recked the loss of <i>Bhīṣma</i> or <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. He formed a <i>makara</i> array: the tip (μ), the two eyes (ν), the head (ξ), the neck (ο), the middle (π), the left foot (ρ), the right foot (σ), the left hind-foot (τ), the right hind-foot (υ), the tail (ϕ). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Arjuna</i> to array the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army and slay <i>Karṇa</i> (“incapable of being vanquished by…D., As., G., K., and M.-U.”). The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops were arrayed in the shape of the half-moon; the left side (χ), the right side (ψ), the middle (ω), the rear (αα); <i>Yudhāmanyu</i> and <i>Uttamaujas</i> became the protectors of <i>Arjuna's</i> chariot wheels, and did not quit him for a moment. Then commenced the battle (VIII, <b>11</b>). A fierce slaughter on both sides (description). <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ββ), headed by <i>Bhīmasena & Kṣemadhūrti (Kulūtādhi-</i> <i>patiḥ</i>), who was slain by <i>Bhīmasena</i>. The <i>Kurus</i> fled away (VIII, <b>12</b>). <i>Nakula & Karṇa; Bhīmasena & Aśvatthāman</i>; <i>Sātyaki</i> & the <i>Kaikaya</i> princes (brothers) <i>Vinda</i> and <i>Anuvinda</i>; King <i>Citrasena & Śrutakarman; Prativindhya & Citra</i>; <i>Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna</i> & the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Kṛpa; Śikhaṇḍin & Kṛtavarman; Śruta-</i> <i>kīrti & Śalya; Sahadeva & Duḥśāsana. Anuvinda</i> was slain by <i>Sātyaki</i>, and so was <i>Vinda; Sātyaki</i> got upon the chariot of <i>Yudhāmanyu</i>, then upon another chariot; the <i>Kaikeyas</i> fled (VIII, <b>13</b>). <i>Śrutakarman</i> & the <i>Abhisāra</i> king <i>Citrasena</i>, whom he slew and then he pursued his flying troops. <i>Prativindhya</i> <i>& Citra</i>, whom he slew. The <i>Kurus</i> fled; only <i>Aśvatthāman</i> <i>& Bhīmasena</i> (VIII, <b>14</b>); Si., Cā., D., and M.-ṛ., applauded them; both were borne away insensible by their drivers (VIII, <b>15</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> & the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>; Si., D.-ṛ., and Cā. applauded him, etc. <i>Aśvatthāman & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa</i>), who fought also the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> (VIII, <b>16</b>); the <i>Kaliṅga, Vaṅga</i>, and <i>Niṣāda</i> heroes attacked <i>Arjuna</i> with a division of elephants, which was broken; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> urged <i>Arjuna</i> not to spare <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who at last was borne away by his steeds and entered the army of <i>Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> proceeded towards the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> (VIII, <b>17</b>). The <i>Magadha</i> chief (lord of <i>Girivraja</i>) <i>Daṇḍadhāra</i> massacred the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army. <i>Arjuna</i> (urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>) & <i>Daṇḍadhāra</i> (on an elephant), whom he slew; his brother <i>Daṇḍa & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa</i>), who slew him; the hostile force broke up: <i>Arjuna</i> proceeded once more against the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> (VIII, <b>18</b>), whom he slaughtered; <i>Ugrāyudha's</i> son & <i>Arjuna</i>, who slew him; urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna</i> smote the remnant of the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>, hastening in order to kill <i>Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa</i> described the dismal sights of the field of battle “for the sake of <i>Duryodhana</i> alone”. The army of <i>Duryodhana</i> was defeated by <i>Pāṇḍya</i> (VIII, <b>19</b>), who regarded himself as superior to <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (γγ), and was slaughtering the army of <i>Karṇa</i>, the <i>Pulindas</i>, etc. (δδ); <i>Aśvatthāman & Pāṇḍya (b</i>), who employed the <i>Vāyavya</i> weapon; mean while <i>Karṇa</i> began to rout the elephant force of the <i>Pāṇḍavas; Pāṇḍya</i> ascended a riderless elephant and split <i>Aśvatthāman's</i> diadem; then <i>Aśvatthāman</i> slew him, who had given numerous steeds, men, and elephants as food to the Rā. <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers worshipped <i>Karṇa</i> (VIII, <b>20</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said to <i>Arjuna</i> that he did not see <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had retreated, and <i>Karṇa</i> was slaying the <i>Sṛñjayas</i>. The <i>Kurus</i> (headed by <i>Karṇa</i>) & the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (headed by <i>Bhīmasena</i>); <i>Karṇa</i> caused a great carnage among the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas</i>, and <i>Pāñcālas</i>. The <i>Pāñcāla</i> chief, etc. (εε), & <i>Karṇa</i> (VIII, <b>21</b>); <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> & the <i>Aṅgas</i>, etc. (ζζ); the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Pāñcālas</i> come to the aid of <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Nakula</i>, etc. (ηη), overloaded the elephants with their weapons; <i>Sātyaki</i> killed the elephant of the <i>Vaṅga</i> king and felled the rider; <i>Sahadeva & Puṇḍra</i>, whose elephant he slew, and then proceeded towards the <i>Aṅga</i> chief; <i>Nakula</i> & the <i>Aṅga</i> king (<i>Mleccha</i> king), whom he slew; the elephant-men of the <i>Aṅgas + Mekalas</i>, etc. (θθ), & <i>Nakula</i>; then the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ιι), rushed to the rescue of <i>Nakula; Sahadeva</i> slew eight elephants and <i>Nakula</i> many; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (κκ), overloaded the elephants with arrows; the hostile army fled away and the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> warriors rushed against <i>Karṇa</i> (VIII, <b>22</b>). <i>Sahadeva & Duḥśāsana</i>, who was taken away by his charioteer; <i>Sahadeva</i> crushed <i>Duryodhana's</i> division (VIII, <b>23</b>). <i>Karṇa & Nakula</i>; both the <i>Somakas</i> and <i>Kurus</i> were greatly afflicted; <i>Nakula</i> fled on foot; <i>Karṇa</i> pursued him and placed his stringed bow around his neck, but let him escape, recollecting the words of <i>Kuntī; Nakula</i> in great shame proceeded towards <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> chariot, which he ascended. <i>Karṇa</i> at noon made a great slaughter among the <i>Pāñśālas</i> and the <i>Sṛñjayas</i>, and pursued them (VIII, <b>24</b>). <i>Ulūka &</i> <i>Yuyutsu</i>, who was vanquished and mounted another chariot. <i>Ulūka</i> slaughtered the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and the <i>Sṛñjayas. Śruta-</i> <i>karman (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & Śatānīka</i>; both were deprived of their chariots and retired; <i>Śrutakarman</i> mounted the chariot of <i>Viviṃśa, Śatānīka</i> that of <i>Prativindhya. Śakuni &</i> <i>Sutasoma</i>, who was deprived of his chariot, but contended on foot with <i>Śakuni</i>, who fought from his chariot; the Si., etc., were highly pleased; <i>Sutasoma</i> went to the chariot of <i>Śrutakīrti</i>; <i>Śakuni</i> slew many of the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army (VIII, <b>25</b>). <i>Kṛpa</i> <i>& Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, who got bewildered and let his charioteer carry him to <i>Bhīmasena</i>, pursued by <i>Kṛpa. Kṛtavarman</i> (the <i>Bhoja</i> king) & <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, who fell into a swoon, and was borne away by his charioteer; the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army fled (VIII, <b>26</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> & the <i>Trigartas</i>, etc. (λλ); <i>Arjuna</i> slew king <i>Śatruñ-</i> <i>jaya</i>, and <i>Suśruta's</i> son, and <i>Candradeva</i>; King <i>Satyasena</i> wounded <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and was slain by <i>Arjuna</i>, who then slew <i>Citravarman</i> and the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> in hundreds and thousands, and <i>Mitrasena</i>, and wounded <i>Suśarman</i>; all the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> attacked <i>Arjuna</i>, who invoked the <i>Aindra</i> weapon (description); the hostile army fled away almost entirely (VIII, <b>27</b>). <i>Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who deprived him of his chariot; <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (μμ), rushed to his aid; the other sons of <i>Pāṇḍu</i> surrounded <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; the <i>Pāñcālas</i> & the <i>Kauravas</i> (description); <i>Karṇa</i> slaughtered the <i>Pāñcālas, Arjuna</i> the <i>Trigartas, Bhīmasena</i> the <i>Kurus</i> and their elephant division, when the sun had passed the meridian (VIII, <b>28</b>); <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> (on another chariot) & <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Duryodhana</i> swooned away; <i>Bhīmasena</i> prevented <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> from slaying <i>Duryodhana; Kṛtavarman & Bhīmasena</i> in the afternoon (VIII, <b>29</b>). The <i>Kurus</i> (placing <i>Karṇa</i> at their van) & the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army (and <i>Sātyaki</i>); <i>Karṇa & Sātyaki</i>; many <i>Kurus</i> came to rescue <i>Karṇa</i>, but fled away before the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, who were headed by the sons of <i>Drupada; Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (having said their daily prayers and worshipped <i>Bhava</i>) destroyed the <i>Kurus; Duryodhana & Arjuna; Arjuna &</i> <i>Aśvatthāman + Kṛpa</i>, etc. (νν); <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ξξ), & <i>Karṇa</i>, who vanquished them; <i>Arjuna & Karṇa</i>; many <i>Kurus</i> fled away. At the close of the day both armies withdrew; Rā. and Pś., etc., appeared (VIII, <b>30</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> exalted the prowess of <i>Arjuna</i> (οο). The <i>Kurus</i>, in grief, took counsel of one another; <i>Karṇa</i> assured <i>Duryodhana</i> that he would slay <i>Arjuna</i> on the morrow. On the morrow they beheld an invincible array formed by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> according to the rules of <i>Bṛhaspati</i> and <i>Uśanas. Duryodhana</i> and his troops put confidence in <i>Karṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> grief (ππ); <i>Sañjaya</i> rebuked him by reminding him of his evil acts (ρρ). At dawn <i>Karṇa</i> repeated before <i>Duryodhana</i> his pledge to slaughter <i>Arjuna</i>; “my bow <i>Vijaya (c</i>) is the foremost of all weapons;…<i>Arjuna</i> is superior to me only by having <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (‘the Creator of the Universe’) for his charioteer, the chariot given him by <i>Agni</i>, his steed, and his standard with the Ape.” He desired to have <i>Śalya</i> (“who is superior to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>”) to drive his chariot; <i>Duryodhana</i> solicited <i>Śalya</i> (VIII, <b>31</b>) to comply with <i>Karṇa's</i> wishes (σσ); <i>Śalya</i> took offence at the proposal (ττ); <i>Duryodhana</i> repeated his request in honorific words (υυ), and <i>Śalya</i> accepted on the condition that he might in <i>Karṇa's</i> presence, utter whatever he desired (ϕϕ) (VIII, <b>32</b>). § 606: <i>Duryodhana</i> related to <i>Śalya</i> Tripurākhyāna (q.v.), which the great Ṛ. <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> had narrated to his father. “As <i>Brahmán</i>,…the Supreme Deity acted as the driver of <i>Rudra</i>, so do thou restrain the steeds of <i>Karṇa</i>” (VIII, <b>33</b>). He then related a story of <i>Paraśu-Rāma (b</i>), which a virtuous brahman had recited in the presence of his father. <i>Rāma</i> gave the <i>Dhanurveda</i> to <i>Karṇa</i>, “whom I do not think to have been born in the <i>Sūta</i> order, but to be the son of a god, born in the <i>Kṣatriya</i> order and abandoned in infancy” (VIII, <b>34</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> said: “So did <i>Brahman</i> act as <i>Rudra's</i> driver; the driver should be superior to the warrior; thou art selected by us as superior to <i>Karṇa</i>.” <i>Śalya</i> said that many a time he had heard this history recited to him, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, knowing the same, had become the charioteer of <i>Arjuna</i>, and would fight if <i>Arjuna</i> were slain. <i>Duryodhana</i> eulogized <i>Karṇa</i> (α) and then <i>Śalya</i> (etymology) as superior to <i>Kṛṣṇa. Śalya</i> repeated his promise and condition. <i>Duryodhana</i> embraced <i>Karṇa</i>, and, requested by him, once more obtained the promise of <i>Śalya</i>, who embraced <i>Duryodhana</i> and asked their forgiveness for the words he might speak to <i>Karṇa</i> for his good; “what I shall say, in order to inspire thee confidence, is fraught with self-adulation; I am a driver like <i>Mātali</i> himself” (VIII, <b>35</b>). —§ 607: <i>Duryodhana</i> said to <i>Karṇa</i>: “<i>Śalya</i>, who is superior to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, will act as a driver, like <i>Mātali</i> to <i>Indra</i>.” <is>When</is> <is>the morning came,</is> <i>Duryodhana</i> again successfully asked <i>Śalya</i> to become <i>Karṇa's</i> charioteer. <i>Karṇa</i> having worshipped the chariot (which had in days of old been sanctified by a priest), they both ascended it. <i>Duryodhana</i> once more addressed <i>Karṇa</i> (α). <i>Karṇa</i> told <i>Śalya</i> to urge the steeds that he might slay <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (β); <i>Śalya</i> endeavoured to inspire <i>Karṇa</i> with fear by eulogizing the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (VIII, <b>36</b>). When <i>Karṇa</i> set out there appeared ill omens. The <i>Kuru</i> army, however, was filled with joy. <i>Karṇa</i> reflected and boasted (γ). <i>Śalya</i> ridiculed him and praised <i>Arjuna</i> (δ). <i>Karṇa</i> proceeded on his chariot with white steeds and tiger-skins, slaying large numbers in battle along his way, and inquired after <i>Arjuna</i> (VIII, <b>37</b>), promising every <i>Pāṇḍava</i> soldier that he met that unto him who pointed out <i>Arjuna</i> to him he would give whatever wealth he desired. <i>Duryodhana</i> and the troops rejoiced; <i>Śalya</i> scornfully laughed, and said (VIII, <b>38</b>) that <i>Karṇa</i> would get to see <i>Arjuna</i> without the trouble of seeking him, and asked him to abandon his desire for a single combat with <i>Arjuna. Karṇa</i> repeated his resolution, and <i>Śalya</i> insulted him in a long speech (VIII, <b>39</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> replied angrily, describing the disreputable practices of the <i>Madrakas</i> (and the <i>Gāndhārakas</i> and <i>Sindhu-Sauvīras</i>) (VIII, <b>40</b>). <i>Śalya</i> answered by praising himself and his accomplishments as a charioteer (description), and by reciting the story of the crow and the swan (<i>Haṃsa-</i> <i>kākīyopākhyāna</i>, q.v.): “Even as that crow, fed upon the remains of the dinners of the <i>Vaiśya</i> children, disregarded his equals and superiors, so dost thou, that art fed by the sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> upon the remains of their dishes, disregard all,” etc. (ε) (VIII, <b>41</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> said that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> were well known to him, but did not make him afraid. The curse, however, of <i>[Paraśu-]Rāma</i> pained him greatly. He dwelt, disguised as a brahman, with <i>Rāma</i> in former days, desirous of obtaining celestial weapons from him. <i>Indra</i>, as a worm, began to pierce his thigh, on which was lying the head of the sleeping <i>Rāma</i>; therefore he did not move. But <i>Rāma</i>, witnessing his patience, discovered that he was not a brahman, and cursed him, saying that this weapon would never, in the time of need, when the hour of his death came, occur to his memory. He had forgotten the weapon, but would, notwithstanding, slay <i>Arjuna</i>; he suspected <i>Śalya</i> of secret friendship with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; he would employ the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, which <i>Arjuna</i> would never be able to escape, if only the wheels of <i>Karṇa's</i> chariot did not sink into the earth that day; he would not take fright at <i>Yama</i> himself with his rod, or <i>Varuṇa</i> with his noose, or <i>Kubera</i> with his mace, or <i>Indra</i> with the thunderbolt. “Once upon a time, while wandering for the sake of practising with my bow <i>Vijaya</i>, I had heedlessly struck the calf of a brahman's <i>homa</i> cow; the brahman cursed me, saying that my wheel would sink into the earth in a battle when I was in great danger. The kings of the Lunar race offered to give that brahman 1,000 kine and 600 bulls, but in vain,” etc. (VIII, <b>42</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> said that it was in vain that <i>Śalya</i> tried to frighten him (ζ) (VIII, <b>43</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> said that in <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> abode the brahmans used to give accounts of various delightful regions and many kings of ancient times; an old brahman had said, blaming the <i>Madrakas</i> and the <i>Bāhīkas</i>, that they should be avoided as being out of the pale of virtue and living away from <i>Himavat</i>, etc. (η), but between Sindhu and its tributary rivers. On some very secret mission <i>Karṇa</i> had to live among the <i>Bāhīkas</i>, and therefore their conduct was well known to him; “there is a town <i>Śākala</i>, a river <i>Āpagā</i>, and a <i>Bāhīka</i> clan <i>Jarttikas</i>; the practices of these people are very censurable” (description; an example is cited of a <i>Bāhīka</i> who happened to live for some days in <i>Kurujāṅgala</i>, and a Rā. woman in <i>Śākala</i>; the rivers <i>Śatadru</i>, etc. (θ), in the countries of the <i>Āraṭṭas</i>, regions without virtue and religion). “D., P., and brahmans never accept gifts from those that are fallen, or those that are begotten by <i>Śūdras</i> on the girls of other castes, or the <i>Bāhīkas</i>, who never perform sacrifices and are exceedingly irreligious.” He mentioned three impure places (ι) (v. the note of PCR., p. 155). There were two <i>Piśācas</i> in the river <i>Vipāśā</i>, named <i>Bahi</i> and <i>Hīka</i>; the <i>Bāhīkas</i> are the offspring of those two Pś.; they are not creatures created by the Creator. The <i>Kāraṣkaras</i>, etc. (κ), and other peoples of no religion one should always avoid; even thus did a Ṛā. woman speak to a brahman who went to that country for bathing in sacred water and passed a single night there. The regions are called <i>Āraṭṭāḥ</i>, the water <i>Bāhīka</i>; the lowest brahmans have resided there from very remote times (<i>brāhmaṇāpasadā yatra tulyakālāḥ Prajāpateḥ</i>), without the <i>Vedas</i>, etc. The <i>Prasthalas</i>, etc. (λ), are almost as blameable in their practices (VIII, <b>44</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> continued his description of the <i>Bāhīkas</i> (and <i>Gāndhāras</i> and <i>Madrakas</i>). The <i>Āraṭṭas</i> had been cursed by a chaste woman. The <i>Kauravas</i>, etc. (μ), know what the eternal religion is. <i>Brahmán</i>, even in the <i>Kṛta</i> age, had censured the practices of the country of the five rivers. <i>K</i>. quoted a saying of the Rā. <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i>, declared by the <i>Rākṣasa</i> to be the formula for curing a person possessed by a Rā. or killed by poison. Remarks on the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (ν), on <i>Agni</i>, etc. (ξ). <i>Śalya</i> spoke in disparagement of the <i>Aṅgas</i> (ο). <i>Duryodhana</i> restored peace between <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śalya</i> (VIII, <b>45</b>).—§ 608: THE SEVENTEENTH DAY'S BATTLE. Beholding the array of the <i>Pārthas</i> made by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Karṇa</i> proceeded to battle and assailed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> inquired about the disposition of the <i>Kuru</i> forces (α). <i>Sañjaya</i> described the <i>Kaurava</i> array: right wing (β); on the right of these (γ); the left side (δ); on their left (ε); in the centre at the head <i>Karṇa</i> with his sons; in the rear <i>Duḥśāsana</i>; and behind him <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers, protected by the united <i>Madrakas</i> and <i>Kekayas; Aśvatthāman</i>, etc., with <i>Mlecchas</i> on elephants followed behind. The array was formed according to the plan of <i>Bṛhaspati. Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, beholding <i>Karṇa</i>, spoke to <i>Arjuna</i> of the hostile array: <i>Arjuna</i> should proceed against <i>Karṇa; Bhīmasena</i> against <i>Duryodhana; Nakula</i> against <i>Vṛṣasena; Sahadeva</i> against <i>Śakuni; Śatānīka</i> against <i>Duḥśāsana; Sātyaki</i> against <i>Kṛtavarman; Pāṇḍya</i> against <i>Aśvatthāman; Yudhiṣṭhira</i> against <i>Kṛpa</i>; the <i>Draupadeyas</i> with <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i> against the rest of the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, etc. <i>Śalya</i> pointed out to <i>Karṇa</i> the chariot of <i>Arjuna (b</i>) and various omens, etc. (ζ); how the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> threatened to slay <i>Arjuna</i> and the other heroes of the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army (η), and he dissuaded him from trying to slay <i>Arjuna</i>. Meanwhile the two armies mingled fiercely in battle (VIII, <b>46</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> about <i>Arjuna</i>, the <i>Saṃ-</i> <i>śaptakas</i>, and <i>Karṇa.

The gods urged <i>Brahmán</i> that the success of both should be equal, <i>Indra</i> that <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> should win; <i>Brahmán</i> and <i>Iśāna</i> (i.e. Śiva) said that the victory of <i>Arjuna</i> was certain (ωʹ); “let <i>Karṇa</i> obtain identity with V. or M.; let him with <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i> be worshipped in heaven.” <i>Indra</i> acquiesced in their words. Description of <i>Karṇa's</i> and <i>Arjuna's</i> chariots. The ape on <i>Arjuna's</i> banner attacked the elephant's rope on <i>Karṇa's</i> banner. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Śalya</i> cast keen glances at each other, and so did <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>. <i>Karṇa</i> asked <i>Śalya</i> what he would do if he was slain; <i>Śalya</i> said that then he would slay both <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>; similarly asked by <i>Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa</i> said that <i>Karṇa</i> could not slay <i>Arjuna</i>; if so, the destruction of the universe would be at hand, and he would himself slay <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śalya. Arjuna</i> said that that very day the wives of <i>Karṇa</i> would become widows (ααʹ) (VIII, <b>87</b>). In the welkin D., N., As., Si., Y., G., Rā., Aps., B.-ṛ., etc., looked on. The battle commenced. <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (αβʹ), & <i>Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa); Arjuna</i> defeated all of them; floral showers fell, etc.; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> told <i>Duryodhana</i> to make peace (αγʹ), but in vain (αδʹ); <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> urged his troops (VIII, <b>88</b>); description of the battle between <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Karṇa; Arjuna</i> employed an <i>Āgneya</i> weapon, which was quenched by <i>Karṇa</i> with a <i>Vāruṇa</i> weapon by means of clouds, which <i>Arjuna</i> dispelled by a <i>Vāyavya</i> weapon; <i>Arjuna</i> employed the <i>Aindra</i> weapon (<i>?astraṃ</i> <i>dayitaṃ devarājñaḥ), Karṇa</i> the <i>Bhārgava</i> weapon. The <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Somakas & Karṇa</i>, who slew them. Seeing <i>Arjuna's</i> weapons baffled by <i>Karṇa, Bhīma</i> urged <i>Arjuna</i> to put forth his strength (αεʹ), and so did <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (αζʹ). <i>Arjuna</i> bowed to <i>Brahmán</i> and invoked the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, which could be applied by the wind alone; <i>Karṇa</i> baffled it; urged by <i>Bhīma, Arjuna</i> applied a second <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, which caused a great carnage among the <i>Kaurava</i> troops (description). <i>Karṇa & Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (αηʹ). <i>Arjuna</i> shot at <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śalya</i>, and slew <i>Sabhāpati</i>, etc. The <i>Kauravas</i> urged <i>Karṇa</i> to slay <i>Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> appeared in order to witness the encounter. <i>Arjuna's</i> bowstring broke; <i>Karṇa</i> took advantage of the interval to hit <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (αθʹ). <i>Karṇa</i> employed as arrows five snakes that had sided with <i>Takṣaka's</i> son [i.e. Aśvasena, at Khāṇḍava]; they penetrated <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> body, entered the earth, and, having bathed [in Bhogavatī], returned to <i>Karṇa</i>, but were cut off by <i>Arjuna</i>, who then covered <i>Karṇa's</i> chariot with showers of arrows and slew 2,000 <i>Kurus</i>, who had been urged by <i>Duryodhana</i> to fight. The <i>Kurus</i> fled, leaving <i>Karṇa</i> to fight singly with <i>Arjuna</i> (VIII, <b>89</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> baffled <i>Arjuna's</i> weapon; <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> shot at each other dense showers of arrows. The snake <i>Aśvasena</i>, who was hostile to <i>Arjuna</i>, was passing his time in the nether region, having escaped from the conflagration at <i>Khāṇḍava</i>; recollecting the death of his mother he now soared up and entered into <i>Karṇa's</i> quiver in the shape of an arrow. <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> were fanned and sprinkled with fragrant sandal water by many Aps. staying in the welkin, and <i>Śakra</i> and <i>Sūrya</i> with their hands gently brushed their faces. <i>Karṇa</i> aimed that arrow, born in <i>Airāvata's</i> race (i.e. the snake in the shape of an arrow), which he had long kept for <i>Arjuna's</i> destruction, and which lay singly in a golden quiver amid sandal dust; omens appeared, and the <i>Lokapālas</i> with <i>Śakra</i> raised loud wails. <i>Karṇa</i> did not know that the snake <i>Aśvasena</i> had entered his arrow by the aid of his <i>yoga</i> powers. <i>Śalya</i> in vain exhorted <i>Karṇa</i> to take another arrow; <i>Karṇa</i> said: “<i>Karṇa</i> never aims an arrow twice; persons like us never become crooked warriors.” <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> with his feet pressed <i>Arjuna's</i> chariot about a cubit into the earth, and the snake-arrow, failing to strike off <i>Arjuna's</i> head, broke his diadem (made by <i>Svayambhū</i> for <i>Indra > Arjuna</i>), incapable of being crushed by <i>Rudra</i>, etc. (αιʹ). Celestial flowers were showered upon <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. <i>Aśvasena</i> appeared to <i>Karṇa</i> and asked him to shoot the same weapon again; <i>Karṇa</i> refused to avail himself of another's help or shoot the same shaft twice. <i>Aśvasena</i> then, of his own accord, rushed on <i>Arjuna</i> in the shape of an arrow; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> informed <i>Arjuna</i> that it was <i>Aśvasena</i>, who, as an unborn child, was saved with his mother at <i>Khāṇḍava. Arjuna</i> cut the snake into pieces, and <i>Krṣṇa</i> with his arms raised the chariot from the earth. Once, when <i>Karṇa</i> was stupefied and stood inactive, <i>Arjuna</i> was disinclined to slay him in such distress, but he was taught by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> never to spare an enemy, however weak. At that time, when the hour of <i>Karṇa's</i> death had come, <i>Kāla</i>, approaching invisibly, in consequence of the brahman's wrath, said “the earth is swallowing up thy wheel,” and the weapon that <i>Rāma</i> had given him escaped from his memory, and the earth engulfed his left wheel. <i>Karṇa</i> began to rail at righteousness as not always protecting its worshippers. <i>Karṇa</i> invoked the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, and <i>Arjuna</i> the <i>Aindra</i> weapon, which was baffled by <i>Karṇa</i>; urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to “shoot high weapons,” <i>Arjuna</i> shot the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon. <i>Karṇa</i> cut off, one after another, eleven bowstrings of <i>Arjuna's</i>, not knowing that <i>Arjuna</i> had one hundred strings to his bow; urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to strike <i>Karṇa</i> with “superior weapons,” <i>Arjuna</i> then consecrated another celestial weapon with <i>mantras</i>, uniting the <i>Raudra</i> weapon with it. At that time the earth swallowed up one of <i>Karṇa's</i> wheels. Quickly alighting, <i>Karṇa</i> seized his sunken wheel with his two arms and endeavoured to lift it up; the earth rose up to the height of four fingers breadth, with her seven islands, etc.; <i>Karṇa</i> shed tears from wrath and asked <i>Arjuna</i> to wait for a moment till he had lifted his sunken wheel (VIII, <b>90</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> taunted <i>Karṇa</i> for appealing to virtue and the rules of fair fight by reminding him of all the wrongs done to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> by himself. and <i>Duryodhana</i> acting according to his counsels (ακʹ). <i>Karṇa</i> dropped his head in shame and gave no answer, and continued to fight. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> urged <i>Arjuna</i> to pierce <i>Karṇa</i> with a celestial weapon; <i>Arjuna</i>, remembering the incidents alluded to by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, blazed up with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate from all the pores of his body, a sight that appeared exceedingly wonderful. Both <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> invoked the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, and <i>Karṇa</i> once more made an effort to extricate his chariot. <i>Arjuna</i> shot an <i>Agni</i> weapon, quenched by <i>Karṇa</i> with a <i>Vāruṇa</i> weapon, covering all the points of the compass with darkness, which <i>Arjuna</i> dispelled with the <i>Vāyavya</i> weapon. Pierced by a shaft of <i>Karṇa's</i>, while the earth trembled, etc., <i>Arjuna</i> began to reel, the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> dropped from his hand, etc. At the interval <i>Karṇa</i> fruitlessly endeavoured to extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses, <i>Arjuna</i> took up an <i>añjalika</i> weapon. Urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to cut off the head of <i>Karṇa, Arjuna</i> cut off his standard, and then, with an <i>añjalika</i> weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out “peace be to the universe”), struck off <i>Karṇa's</i> head before <i>Karṇa</i> could mount his chariot. A light issued from <i>Karṇa's</i> body and entered the Sun. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> rejoiced (αλʹ) (VIII, <b>91</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., grieved; <i>Bhīma</i>, uttering loud roars, frightened the <i>Kauravas</i>, etc. (αμʹ). <i>Śalya</i> informed <i>Duryodhana</i> of <i>Karṇa's</i> death (ανʹ). <i>Duryodhana</i> became almost deprived of his senses (VIII, <b>92</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> related the state of the <i>Kaurava</i> army after <i>Karṇa's</i> fall (αξʹ). <i>Duryodhana</i> resolved to make a final stand (αοʹ). <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (+ four kinds of forces) & <i>Duryodhana</i> (+ 25,000 warriors on foot, who were slain); <i>Arjuna</i> & the chariot force of the <i>Kauravas</i>; <i>Nakula</i>, etc. (απʹ), & <i>Śakuni</i>; the <i>Kurus</i> fled away; <i>Cekitāna</i>, etc. (αρʹ), blew their conches. <i>Duryodhana</i> challenged all the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and fought with them with great valour; he rallied the remnants of his troops and exhorted them to fight (ασʹ); they fled away heedless of his words (VIII, <b>93</b>). <i>Śalya</i> described to <i>Duryodhana</i> the carnage on the field (ατʹ), and urged the withdrawal of the troops to their nightly quarters. Having repeatedly comforted <i>Duryodhana</i>, they retired headed by <i>Aśvatthāman. Karṇa</i> did not lose his splendour. D., Ṛ., etc., retired. The portents that were seen at <i>Karṇa's</i> fall. <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> blew their conches, at which the <i>Kauravas</i> left the field, deserting <i>Śalya</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i>. D., G., men, Cā., M.-ṛ., Y., and M.-U. congratulated <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> (VIII, <b>94</b>). Enumeration of the <i>Kauravas</i> retiring from the field (αυʹ). Urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (αϕʹ), who told <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (αχʹ), to stand there with care, <i>Arjuna</i> presented himself to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who, rising from his bed, greeted <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa</i> congratulated <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (αψʹ), who ascribed his success to <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> influence (αωʹ). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, came back to the field to have a look at <i>Karṇa's</i> body. The kings, filled with joy, approached <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and gladdened him greatly; so <i>Nakula</i>, etc. (βαʹ). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and <i>Gāndhārī</i> swooned away and were comforted by <i>Vidura</i>, <i>Sañjaya</i>, and the <i>Kuru</i> ladies.
