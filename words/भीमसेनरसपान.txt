Duryodhana</i> then built a palace (<i>Udakakrīḍana</i>) at <i>Pramāṇakoṭi</i>, on the banks of the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, in order to sport in the water there. There he invited the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and poured <i>kālakūṭaka</i> poison into the food of <i>Bhīma</i>, and when <i>Bhīma</i> had lost his senses, <i>Duryodhana</i> bound him and threw him into the water, where he sunk down to the dwelling of the <i>Nāgas</i>, who bit him, but could not penetrate his thick skin. The immovable (i.e. vegetable) <i>kālakūṭaka</i> poison was neutralised by the movable (i.e. animal) serpent poison. <i>Bhīma</i> awoke and began to crush the serpents, until <i>Vāsuki</i> came, and, informed by <i>Āryaka</i> that he was the daughter's son of <i>Āryaka's</i> daughter's son, let him drink as much of their <i>rasa</i> (containing the strength of 1,000 elephants (serpents?) in each <i>kuṇḍa</i>) as he could. He drank eight <i>kuṇḍas</i>, and then was laid on a bed (I, <b>128</b>). When the <i>Kauravas</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had returned to <i>Hāstinapura</i>, Yudhiṣṭhira (“himself unacquainted with wickedness, and regarding others as honest as himself,” v. 5037) asked <i>Kuntī</i> if <i>Bhīma</i> had come home. <i>Vidura</i> consoled her. On the eighth day <i>Bhīma</i> awoke from his slumber, bathed in the holy waters, ate of the <i>paramānna</i> (rice boiled in milk with sugar), etc., and was placed by the <i>Nāgas</i> in the same gardens, whence he ran home. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> ordered him to keep silence on this accident, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> [with <i>Vidura's</i> advice] became very vigilant from this day (the words in brackets are from B., where also v. 5068<i>a</i> is placed after v. 5070<i>a</i>). [<i>sārathiṃ cāsya dayitam apahastena jaghnivān</i> (see BR., s.v. <i>apahasta</i>, cf. iii, v. 545). <i>Duryodhana</i> again poured <i>kālakūṭaka</i> poison into the food of <i>Bhīma. Yuyutsu</i> informed the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> of this; but <i>Bhīma</i> swallowed the poison and digested it, and it produced no change in him.]— <i>Duryodhana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Śakuni</i> had recourse to numerous other contrivances in order to kill the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, who, though knowing it, yet, in accordance with the advice of <i>Vidura</i>, suppressed their indignation. Seeing the princes passing their time in play, <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> appointed <i>Gautama</i> (i.e. <i>Kṛpa</i>, born in a thicket of reeds and well skilled in the meaning of the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>śāstras</i>) as their preceptor (I, <b>129</b>)."
