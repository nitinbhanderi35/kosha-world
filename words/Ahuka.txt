For genealogy, see “YADU VAṂŚA”. In M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 33, we find that Akrūra had married Sutanū, the daughter of Āhuka. Āhuka had a hundred sons. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 56). There were constant quarrels between Āhuka and Akrūra. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 81, Verses 8-11)."
