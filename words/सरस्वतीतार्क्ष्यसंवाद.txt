Then she spoke of the <i>agnihotra</i>; she said she had come from the <i>agnihotra</i> to clear away the doubts of the <i>brahmarṣis</i>, and that she was nourished by sacrifice. <i>Tārkṣya</i> asked her about the salvation (<i>mokṣa</i>) taught by <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and <i>Yoga</i>; she again mentioned the <i>Vedic</i> sacrifice; [this (v. 12732—12745) is wanting in PCR.] (III, <b>186</b>)."
