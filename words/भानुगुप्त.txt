As regards the position of Bhānugupta, several alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a successor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānugupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he belonged to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to determine. The latter view seems more probable and this internal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the empire.<sup>117</sup> Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta empire.<sup>118</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’."
