Śikhaṇḍin</i> (proceeding towards <i>Droṇa</i>) & <i>Kṛpa</i>; (<i>Śikhaṇḍin</i> was carried away by his charioteer); the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Somakas</i> surrounded him, and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> sons surrounded <i>Droṇa</i>. A battle commenced once more (description) (VII, <b>169</b>). <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (+ the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>) & <i>Droṇa</i>; D., G., and Dā. wished prosperity to <i>Droṇa</i>; <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (λλ) (in order to rescue <i>Droṇa</i>) & <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Drumasena</i>, whom he slew; the six chariot warriors & <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Sātyaki</i> (in order to rescue <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>) & <i>Karṇa</i>; the sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra + Karṇa +</i> <i>Karṇa's</i> son <i>Vṛṣasena & Dhṛṣṭadyumna + Sātyaki; Gāṇḍīva</i> was heard, and the sound of <i>Arjuna's</i> chariot. <i>Karṇa</i> counselled <i>Duryodhana</i> to encompass and slay <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and <i>Sātyaki; Duryoḍhana</i> dispatched <i>Śakuni</i> with a large force (also <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, etc. (μμ)) against <i>Arjuna</i>, to slay <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (νν); a great fight commenced. <i>Śakāuni</i>, etc., & <i>Sātyaki</i>; <i>Droṇa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> + the <i>Pāñcālas</i> (VII, <b>170</b>). <i>Sātyaki</i> was surrounded by many leaders of the <i>Kuru</i> army; <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana & Yuyudhāna</i>, who forced him to fly away (having mounted the chariot of <i>Kṛtavarman</i>), and routed the foes with whom he was engaged. <i>Arjuna & Śakuni</i> (+ his son <i>Ulūka</i>), whom he deprived of his chariot; <i>Śakuni</i> ascended the chariot of <i>Ulūka; Arjuna</i> slew the <i>Kuru</i> army. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> blew their conches. <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa</i>, whom <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> checked and caused an immense carnage. <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ξξ), blew their conches (VII, <b>171</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> in anger addressed <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> (οο), who furiously attacked and routed the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army; <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ππ); the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> host fled, throwing down their torches before the eyes of <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (ρρ), pursued by <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa; Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> rallied the retreating troops (σσ); a wild battle ensued between the <i>Kurus</i> (especially <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>) and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (especially <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>) (description) (VII, <b>172</b>). <i>Karṇa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, who was deprived of his chariot by him, but then slew his steeds and ascended the chariot of <i>Arjuna</i> and desired to proceed, but was stopped by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Karṇa</i> routed the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, who, with the <i>Somakas</i>, attacked <i>Karṇa</i>. Meanwhile <i>Karṇa's</i> charioteer had yoked other white steeds of the <i>Sindhu</i> breed to his chariot. The <i>Pāñcāla</i> host (and the <i>Sṛñjayas</i>) fled (description); others, only observed by <i>Droṇa</i>, fled away on all sides. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> (and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>) conversed about <i>Karṇa; Arjuna</i> asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to proceed towards <i>Karṇa. Kṛṣṇa</i> said that none except <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> could encounter him; but <i>Arjuna</i> must not do it, as long as he had the lance given him by <i>Indra</i>; “but <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> (who had celestial weapons, as also those used by Rā. and As.), would vanquish <i>Karṇa</i>.” They prevailed upon <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> to encounter <i>Karṇa</i> (ττ); “thou, O <i>Ghaṭotkaca, Sātyaki</i>, and <i>Bhīmasena</i> are the foremost among all our warriors; <i>Sātyaki</i> will protect thy rear.” <i>Ghaṭotkaca & Karṇa</i> (VII, <b>173</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> urged <i>Duḥśāsana</i> to protect <i>Karṇa</i> against <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>. Meanwhile the Rā. <i>Jaṭāsura's</i> son <i>Alambuṣa</i> said to <i>Duryodhana</i> that he wished to slay the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in order to avenge his father, whom they had slain, performing some Rā.-slaying incantations. <i>Duryodhana</i> urged him to slay <i>Ghaṭotkaca. Alambuṣa & Ghaṭotkaca</i>; both resorted to their power of illusion (υυ); <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> slew <i>Alambuṣa</i> and threw his head upon <i>Duryodhana's</i> chariot, promising that he should also see the slaughter of <i>Karṇa</i> and then his own. <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> <i>& Karṇa</i> (VII, <b>174</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> described <i>Ghaṭotkaca's</i> person, armour, weapons, and chariot; then the encounter between <i>Karṇa & Ghaṭotkaca</i>, who employed Rā.-illusion, and even destroyed the celestial weapon of <i>Karṇa</i>; a <i>Vāyavya</i> weapon was employed by <i>Karṇa</i> to destroy clouds; <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> was once seen on a chariot, created by illusion, yoked with a number of asses, looking like elephants, and having the faces of <i>Piśācas</i>; <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> employed an <i>aśani</i> of <i>Rudra's</i> workmanship, furnished with eight wheels; there appeared many Rā., Pś., and <i>Yātudhānas</i>, etc. (VII, <b>175</b>). Meanwhile, the Rā. <i>Alāyudha</i>, with many thousands of Rā., came to <i>Duryodhana</i>, and said that he wished to avenge his kinsmen <i>Baka</i> and <i>Kirmīra</i>, and his friend <i>Hiḍimba</i>, and the marriage of <i>Hiḍimbā</i>, by slaying all the sons of <i>Kuntī</i>, especially <i>Bhīma</i>, with <i>Kṛṣṇa, Ghaṭotkaca</i>, etc. <i>Duryodhana</i> urged him to slay <i>Bhīma. Alāyudha's</i> chariot, steeds, weapons, etc., were pretty much as those of <i>Ghaṭotkaca's</i> (description) (VII, <b>176</b>). The <i>Kurus</i> with <i>Duryodhana</i> welcomed <i>Alāyudha</i>, having been (with <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ϕϕ)), very anxious about <i>Karṇa</i>, who was engaged with <i>Ghaṭotkaca. Alāyudha & Ghaṭotkaca</i> (abandoning <i>Karṇa</i>); <i>Karṇa & Bhīmasena; Bhīma</i> (disregarding the advancing <i>Karṇa</i>) <i>& Alāyudha</i> (abandoning <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>) + all the other Rā. (who fled away); the Rā. attacked the elephants, the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, and the <i>Sṛñjayas. Kṛṣṇa</i> urged <i>Arjuna</i> to proceed in <i>Bhīma's</i> wake, and to let <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (χχ), proceed against <i>Karṇa, Nakula</i>, etc. (ψψ), slay the other Rā.; <i>Arjuna</i> himself should resist <i>Droṇa's</i> division; then <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> dispatched <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> to protect <i>Bhīmasena</i> (VII, <b>177</b>). <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> (abandoning <i>Karṇa</i>) & <i>Alāyudha</i> (brother of <i>Baka</i>). Meanwhile, <i>Yuyudhāna</i>, etc. (ωω), & the Rā. of <i>Alāyudha; Arjuna</i> shot many <i>kṣatriyas, Karṇa</i> many <i>Pāñcālas</i> headed by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc. <i>Bhīma</i> <i>+ Nakula</i>, etc. (ααα) (having slain the Rā.) & <i>Karṇa</i>; the <i>Pāñcālas & Droṇa; Alāyudha</i> resorted to his power of illusion, and so did <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, who cut off the head of <i>Alāyudha</i> and threw it down before <i>Duryodhana</i>, who, with all his troops, became full of anxiety, while the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> roared like lions (VII, <b>178</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> & the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (βββ); many of them entered the force of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Ghaṭotkaca &</i> <i>Karṇa</i>, who had his steeds and charioteer slain by <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, who then disappeared from view, and created a terrible illusion (description), which severely afflicted the <i>Kuru</i> host, which at last fled; <i>Karṇa</i> alone kept his ground, looked at by all the <i>Saindhavas</i> and <i>Bāhlikas; Karṇa's</i> steeds were again slain by <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, and his celesṭial weapon was baffled by <i>Ghaṭotkava's</i> illusion. The <i>Kauravas</i> urged him to slay <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> with the dart presented to him by <i>Indra</i>, without minding <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (γγγ). When <i>Karṇa</i> held the dart in his hands <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> began to fly away in fear, all creatures in the skies uttered loud cries, etc.; <i>Karṇa</i> hurled the dart, and <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> was slain, and falling upon the <i>Kaurava</i> army with his gigantic body, he slew a full <i>akṣauhiṇī</i>, desirous of benefiting the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. The <i>Kauravas</i> uttered loud shouts of joy; <i>Karṇa</i> ascended the chariot of <i>Duryodhana</i> and entered the <i>Kuru</i> host (VII, <b>179</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were filled with grief; only <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> with transports of delight raised his warcry, embracing <i>Arjuna</i>, to whom he explained that he rejoiced because <i>Karṇa's</i> dart could not now kill <i>Arjuna</i>, having been employed against <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>; he recited to <i>Arjuna</i> how he had gradually caused all the foes of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to be slain (VII, <b>180</b>), which he explained more explicitly (δδδ) (VII, <b>181</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> why <i>Karṇa</i> had not hurled the fatal dart at <i>Arjuna, Sañjaya</i> assigned <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> policy as the reason (εεε), though it had formed the subject of deliberation with <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (ζζζ), every night. <i>Sātyaki</i> asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> why <i>Karṇa</i> had not hurled his dart at <i>Arjuna; Kṛṣṇa</i> said that <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, etc., had frequently discussed this subject, and <i>Karṇa</i> had approved of it; but <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> always used to stupefy him; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had neither sleep nor joy in his heart, as long as he could not frustrate that instrument for killing <i>Arjuna</i> (VII, <b>182</b>). Concluding from <i>Karṇa's</i> not using the dart (εεε, ζζζ), <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> attributed the ill success of the <i>Kurus</i> to Destiny, their own folly, and the policy of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and asked <i>Sañjaya</i> about the battle (ηηη). <i>Sañjaya</i> related: All the <i>Kauravas</i> uttered loud shouts and began to slay the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> told <i>Bhīmasena</i> to resist the <i>Dhārta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra</i> host, himself sitting down with tearful face; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> comforted him, but <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> remembered the many services <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> had rendered them (θθθ); <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Aśvatthāman</i> were the real cause of <i>Abhimanyu's</i> slaughter, but it was <i>Jayadratha</i> who was slain; “<i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> are the root of our woes”; therefore <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> will slay <i>Karṇa</i>, <i>Bhīmasena</i> being engaged with <i>Droṇa's</i> division. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> quickly proceeded against <i>Karṇa</i>, followed by the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (ιιι). <i>Vyāsa</i> approached <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and congratulated him upon <i>Karṇa's</i> having employed his dart against <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>; “on the 5th day from hence the earth will be thine.” Then he disappeared (VII, <b>183</b>)."
