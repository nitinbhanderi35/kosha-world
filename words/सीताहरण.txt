Rāmopākhyānap.). <i>Rāvaṇa</i> caused <i>Mārīca</i> to entice away <i>Rāma</i> by assuming the shape of a deer with golden horns and a golden skin. Seeing this deer <i>Rāma</i> pursued it, like <i>Rudra</i> pursuing the stellar deer (<i>tārāmṛgaṃ</i>) in days of yore; struck with <i>Rāma's</i> arrow <i>Mārīca</i>, imitating <i>Rāma's</i> voice cried out, calling upon <i>Sītā</i> and <i>Lakṣmaṇa. Lakṣmaṇa</i>, thinking that nobody was able to slay <i>Rāma</i>, at first inclined to stay there and protect <i>Sītā</i>, but as she suspected him, he set out on the track of <i>Rāma</i>. Then <i>Rāvaṇa</i>, in the guise of an ascetic, with shaven head and with a <i>kuṇḍala</i> and a triple staff, came to the hermitage and began to carry away <i>Sītā</i> to <i>Laṅkā</i>; on his way he was seen by the vulture <i>Jaṭāyu</i> (III, <b>278</b>)."
