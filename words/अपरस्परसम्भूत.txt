(The verse of the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> (16. 8.) where this word occurs: ‘असत्यमप्रतिष्ठं ते जगदाहु- रनीश्वरम् । अपरस्परसंभूतं किमन्यत्कामहैतुकम् ।’ is to be rendered, in my opinion, thus: ‘they (the men of demoniac nature) affirm that the world is devoid of truth, of stability and without a Lord (a creator): but does there exist any thing else, that is produced by (or in) an uninterrupted series, and yet is the effect of arbitrariness?’; the uninterrupted series being that of causes and effects according to the SāṅkhyaYoga doctrine of the successive developement of the world.) E. अपरस्पर and सम्भूत."
