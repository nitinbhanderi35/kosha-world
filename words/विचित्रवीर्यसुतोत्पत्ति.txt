Bhīṣma-Satyavatī-saṃvāda). <i>Satyavatī</i> related to <i>Bhīṣma</i> the birth of <i>Dvaipāyana</i> (cf. § 77; from the darkness of his skin he is also called <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (v. 4236)), who instantly came when <i>Kālī</i> (i.e. Satyavatī) thought of him, and promised to raise offspring in the widows of <i>Vicitravīrya</i>. As there was no time for them to observe a rigid vow for one full year, he ordered that they should tolerate his ugliness. <i>Satyavatī</i> first addressed herself to <i>Kausalyā</i> (i.e. Ambikā) and fed <i>brahmans, devarṣis</i>, and guests (I, <b>105</b>). <i>Ambikā</i>, seeing <i>Vyāsa</i>, closed her eyes in fear; therefore her son, though he was destined to be mighty, etc., and to have 100 sons, had to be blind. After his (i.e. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i>) birth, <i>Vyāsa</i> approached <i>Ambālikā</i>, who became pale with fear; therefore, her son was pale and was named <i>Pāṇḍu. Ambālikā</i> refused to receive <i>Vyāsa</i> again and sent him a <i>śūdra</i> maid of hers, adorned with her own ornaments; on her he begat <i>Vidura</i>, who was <i>Dharma</i>, born under the curse of <i>Māṇḍavya. Vyāsa</i> then disappeared (I, <b>106</b>)."
