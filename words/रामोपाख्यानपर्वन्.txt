Rāmopākhyāna, Rāmāyaṇa.) § 525: As <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> if he knew any one more unfortunate than he was (III, <b>273</b>), <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> related the story of <i>Rāma Dāśarathi</i>: King <i>Aja</i> of <i>Ikṣvāku's</i> race had a son <i>Daśaratha</i>, who had four virtuous sons: <i>Rāma</i> (son of <i>Kausalyā</i>), <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> and <i>Śatrughna</i> (sons of <i>Sumitrā</i>), and <i>Bharata</i> (son of <i>Kaikeyī</i>). <i>Sītā</i>, the daughter of the <i>Videha</i> king <i>Janaka</i>, was created by <i>Tvaṣṭṛ</i> himself to become the wife of <i>Rāma</i>. <i>Prajāpati</i> (<i>Pitāmaha, Svayambhū</i>, the Creator of all the worlds) had a mind-born son <i>Pulastya</i>, who with a cow begat a son <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> (i.e. <i>Kubera</i>). Leaving his father, <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> went to his grandfather, and angered at this, his father with half of his own self became born as <i>Viśravas</i> for wreaking vengeance on <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i>. But <i>Pitāmaha</i>, pleased with <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i>, gave him immortality and made him the sovereign of wealth (<i>Dhaneśa</i>), a <i>lokapāla</i> and friend of <i>Īśāna</i>, and gave him a son <i>Nalakūbara</i>, and <i>Laṅkā</i> for his capital, guarded by hosts of <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and the <i>vimāna Puṣpaka</i> capable of going everywhere, and the kingship of the <i>Yakṣas</i>, etc. (III, <b>274</b>).—§ 526: The <i>muni Viśravas</i> was greatly enraged against <i>Vaiśravaṇa. Kubera (Naravāhana</i>), the king of the <i>Rākṣasas</i>, always sought to please his father, and, living in <i>Laṅkā</i>, sent three <i>Rākṣasa</i> women (α) skilled in singing and dancing to wait upon him. <i>Pulastya</i> granted them boons: to <i>Puṣpotkaṭā</i> two sons: <i>Kumbhakarṇa</i> and <i>Daśa-</i> <i>grīva (= Rāvaṇa); Mālinī</i> bore one son, <i>Vibhīṣaṇa; Rākā</i> became the mother of the twins <i>Khara</i> and <i>Śūrpaṇakhā</i>. <i>Vibhīṣaṇa</i> surpassed everybody in beauty and was very pious; <i>Daśagrīva</i> was energetic and strong; <i>Kumbhakarṇa</i> was the most powerful in battle and a master of illusion; <i>Khara</i> was proficient in archery and hostile to <i>brahmans; Śūrpaṇakhā</i> troubled the ascetics (<i>siddhavighnakarī</i>). Learned in the <i>Vedas</i>, they lived with their father on <i>Gandhamādana</i>. And there they beheld <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> seated with their father, and seized with jealousy, they gratified <i>Brahmán</i> with severe penances (β), while <i>Khara</i> and <i>Śūrpaṇakhā</i> protected and attended on them. After 1,000 years <i>Daśagrīva</i>, cutting off his head (i.e. heads), offered it (i.e. them) in the fire, and <i>Brahmán</i> appeared and made them desist from their austerities, granting them boons (γ) except immortality. Now <i>Daśagrīva</i> defeated <i>Kubera</i> in battle and drove him from <i>Laṅkā; Kubera</i> then, followed by <i>Gandharvas, Yakṣas</i>, <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and <i>Kinnaras</i>, went to live on <i>Gandhamādana</i>. <i>Rāvaṇa</i> took from him <i>Puṣpaka</i>, upon which <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> cursed him saying: “This chariot shall never carry thee, but him who will slay thee in battle, and as thou hast insulted thy elder brother thou shalt soon die.” <i>Vibhīṣaṇa</i> followed <i>Kubera</i>, who invested him with the command of the <i>Yakṣa</i> and <i>Rākṣasa</i> hosts. On the other hand, the man-eating <i>Rākṣasas</i> and <i>Piśācas</i> anointed <i>Daśagrīva</i> as their sovereign. <i>Daśagrīva</i> deprived the gods and <i>Daityas</i> of their valuable possessions, and because he terrified (<i>rāvayām āsa</i>, v. 15928) all creatures, he was called <i>Rāvaṇa</i> (III, <b>275</b>). The <i>Brahmarṣis, Siddhas</i>, and <i>Devarṣis</i>, with <i>Agni</i> as their spokesman, sought the protection of <i>Brahmán</i>, who said that the four-armed <i>Viṣṇu</i> had already been incarnate for this object, and caused <i>Indra</i> and the gods, <i>Gandharvas</i>, and <i>Dānavas</i> to beget strong sons, capable of assuming any form at will, on monkeys and bears; and the <i>Gandharvī</i> <i>Dundubhī</i> he caused to be born on earth as the hunch backed <i>Mantharā</i>, who, instructed by <i>Brahmán</i>, went hither and thither ever engaged in fomenting quarrels (III, <b>276</b>).— § 527: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya</i> related: The sons of <i>Daśaratha</i> were conversant with the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Dhanurveda. Rāma</i> equalled <i>Indra</i> and <i>Bṛhaspati</i>. At night, the <i>Puṣya</i> being in a lucky conjuncture, <i>Rāma</i> was to be invested as <i>yuvarāja. Mantharā</i> aroused the jealousy of <i>Kaikeyī</i> against <i>Kausalyā, Kaikeyī</i> prevailed upon <i>Daśaratha</i> that <i>Bharata</i> should be anointed and <i>Rāma</i> be in exile in the forest of <i>Daṇḍaka</i> for fourteen years. <i>Rāma</i> was accompanied by <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> and <i>Sītā. Daśaratha</i> died. <i>Bharata</i> rebuked <i>Kaikeyī</i> and set off to find <i>Rāma</i>, accompanied by <i>Kausalyā, Sumitrā, Kaikeyī, Śatrughna</i>, <i>Vasiṣṭha, Vāmadeva</i>, etc. He saw <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> on the mountain <i>Citrakūṭa</i>, but <i>Rāma</i> would adhere to the order of his father. <i>Bharata</i> then ruled in Nandigrāma, keeping before him the shoes of <i>Rāma</i>.—§ 528: <i>Rāvaṇagamana</i> (q.v.).—§ 529: <i>Sītāharaṇa</i> (q.v.).—§ 530: <i>Viśvāvasumokṣaṇa</i> (q.v.).—§ 531: Having bathed in the lake <i>Pampā, Rāma</i> and <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> on the mountain <i>Ṛṣya-</i> <i>mūka</i> beheld the monkey-king <i>Sugrīva</i> (whom his brother <i>Vālin</i> had deprived of his wife <i>Tārā</i> and his kingdom) and his four counsellors, <i>Hanūmat</i> (equalling <i>Himavat</i>), etc. <i>Sugrīva</i> showed <i>Rāma</i> a piece of cloth that had been dropped by <i>Sītā. Sugrīva</i> promised to bring back <i>Sītā. Rāma</i> installed <i>Sugrīva</i> as king of all the monkeys and promised to slay <i>Vālin</i>. Then they all repaired to <i>Kiṣkindhyā. Vālin</i> came out; <i>Tārā</i> (who understood the voice of every creature) told him that it was <i>Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Ṃainda, Dvivida</i>, <i>Hanūmat, Jāmbavat</i> (the king of the bears), and <i>Sugrīva</i> who had come to destroy him. <i>Vālin</i> suspected <i>Tārā</i>. Near the mountain <i>Mālyavat</i> he had an encounter with <i>Sugrīva</i>. <i>Hanūmat</i> placed a garland round <i>Sugrīva's</i> neck (so that he shone like the mountain Malaya), and <i>Rāma</i> recognized <i>Sugrīva</i> by that sign and killed <i>Vālin</i> with an arrow. <i>Sugrīva</i> thus regained <i>Kiṣkindhyā</i> and <i>Tārā. Rāma</i> dwelt on Mālyavat for four months.—§ 532: <i>Sītāsāntvana</i> (q.v.).— § 533: <i>Sītā-Rāvaṇasaṃvāda</i> (q.v.).—§ 534: <i>Hanūmat-</i> <i>pratyāgamana</i> (q.v.).—§ 535: <i>Setubandhana</i> (q.v.).—§ 536: <i>Laṅkāpraveśa</i> (q.v.).—§ 537: <i>Rāma-Rāvaṇayuddha</i> (q.v.).— § 538: <i>Kumbhakarṇaraṇagamana</i> (q.v.).—§ 539: <i>Kumbha-</i> <i>karṇādivadha</i> (q.v.).—§ 540: <i>Indrajidyuddha</i> (q.v.).—§ 541: <i>Indrajidvadha</i> (q.v.).—§ 542: <i>Rāvaṇavadha</i> (q.v.).—§ 543: <i>Rāmābhiṣeka</i> (q.v.).—§ 544: <i>Yudhiṣṭhirāśvāsa</i> (q.v.)."
