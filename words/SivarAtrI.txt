Śivarātrī is observed on the eve of New moon day (Caturdaśī) falling in the middle of Māgha and Phālguna (February-March). During this night, penance should be done with fasting. On Caturdaśī day penance (vrata) should be observed without sleep and food and Śiva worshipped. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Origin.</i> There is the following Purāṇic story about the origin of the observance of Śivarātri as a sacred day. Brahmā took his birth in the lotus that originated from the navel of Viṣṇu. Brahmā trying to know the source of the lotus saw Viṣṇu only. He asked, ‘Who are you?’ and was answered ‘I am Viṣṇu, your father’. That answer did not satisfy Brahmā and a quarrel ensued between him and Viṣṇu which ended in fighting. Brahmā shot the Brahmāstra, which Viṣṇu countered with Pāśupatāstra and neither of the two was able to withdraw it, which went round the world. While both stood aghast not knowing what to do, Śivaliṅga appeared betwixt the two. Both the ends of the liṅga were invisible. To find the ends Brahmā went upwards and Viṣṇu downwards. Though they travelled a great distance they could not find out the ends, and, so, returned to their old seats. Immediately Śiva appeared betwixt the two and withdrew the pāśupatāstra. It was on Caturdaśī day in the month of Māgha that Śiva thus appeared. Śiva enjoined that in future Caturdaśī night every year should be observed as a holy day, which should be known as Śivarātri. (Kaṇṇaśśa Rāmāyaṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>The greatness of Śivarātri.</i> The following story about a sinner, who attained Śivaloka by observing Śivarātri is related in Śivarātrimāhātmya. <dvsn n='NI'/>A son named Sukumāra was born to the Brahmin manager of the king of Kuñjara, a kingdom on the banks of river Sindhu. The boy grew up to be an immoral fellow and he married a Caṇḍāla girl with whom he lived for seven years. Five daughters and two sons were born to him of the Caṇḍāla woman. The father, Sukumāra, himself married the daughters. One day he, in the course of his search for a flower to be worn on the hair of the Caṇḍāla woman, came near the Śiva temple called Nāgeśvara. A Śivarātri festival was being celebrated there that day and Sukumāra, participated in it. Shortly afterwards Sukumāra died. Messengers of Kāla and Śiva arrived to carry off his soul and a battle ensued between the two for the soul. His soul attained Śivaloka as he had, though by accident, participated in Śivarātri festival."
