Once five gandharva maidens named Pramodinī, Suśīlā, Susvarā, Sutārā and Candrikā fell in love with him and requested him to marry them. Being a strict Brahmacārin Agnipa was offended by this request and so he cursed them and turned them into fiends. Vedanidhi pitied them and sought the advice of sage Lomaśa as to how those unfortunate maidens could be redeemed from the curse. According to Lomaśa's advice the five maidens bathed in the holy lake of Prayāgatīrtha and regained their original forms. Then obeying the instructions of sage Lomaśa Agnipa married all these five gandharva maidens. (Chapters 128 and 129, Uttarakhaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa)."
