The word is rendered by the St. Petersburg Dictionary and by Weber<sup>2</sup> as ‘one who cuts in pieces,’ a ‘carver,’ but Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> thinks that it means one who causes an enmity which has been lulled to rest to break out again. <F>1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Bṛāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1.</F> <F>2) <i>Indische Streifen,</i> 1, 75, n. 5.</F> <F>3) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, <i>loc. cit.</i></F>"
