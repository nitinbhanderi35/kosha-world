Gaṇadevas consist of the 12 Ādityas, 10 Viśvadevas, 8 Vasus, 36 Tuṣitas, 64 Ābhāsvaras, 49 Anilas 220 Mahārājikas, 12 Sādhyas and 11 Rudras. <dvsn n='NI'/>Among the Upadevas there are 10 subdivisions. They are, Vidyādharas, Apsaras, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Piśācas, Guhyakas, Siddhas and Bhūtas. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Origin.</i> There are different views relating to the origin of the Yakṣas. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter l we find that the Yakṣas took birth after Brahmā's birth from “Virāṭ Puruṣa's” aṇḍa. According to a statement in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19, Yakṣas and Rākṣasas were born from Munī, the grand daughter of Kaśyapaprajāpati. Thus Yakṣas and Rākṣasas are related as brothers. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 7, there is another passage which says that Yakṣas are the progeny of the sage Pulastya. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>i) Once Śukadeva sang the story of Mahābhārata to the Yakṣas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 108). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Lakhs of Yakṣas remain in Kubera's assembly, worshipping him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 18). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) There are Yakṣas in Brahmā's assembly also. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 56). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Kubera is the King of Yakṣas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 111, Verse 10). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Bhīmasena once drove away Yakṣas and Rākṣasas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 16, Verse 57). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vi) On another occasion, Sunda and Upasunda defeated and persecuted the Yakṣas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 208, verse 7)."
