Paraśurāma once went to the forests and did penance to please Śiva to learn archery from him. Śiva in the form of a Mṛgavyādha (forest hunter) appeared before Paraśurāma and tested his sincerity in his penance in several ways. Śiva was pleased to find Paraśurāma's devotion to Śiva unwavering and blessed him. He gave instructions in archery and also permitted him to go round the earth. (Chapter 65, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa)."
