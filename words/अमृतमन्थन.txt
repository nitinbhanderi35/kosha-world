Āstīkaparvan. § 28: Once the gods having assembled on the summit of Mount <is>Meru, Nārāyaṇa</is> told Brahmán to churn the Ocean with the gods and the <is>Asuras</is>, in order to obtain Amṛta (I, <b>17</b>). <is>Viṣṇu</is> and Brahmán prevailed upon <is>Ananta</is> (i.e. Śeṣa), the prince of Snakes, to bring up the mountain <is>Mandara</is>. The gods having obtained from the Ocean the permission to churn it, <is>Indra</is> placed Mandara on the back of the Tortoise-king; Mandara was made the churning staff and <is>Vāsuki</is> the cord, the Asuras holding him by the hood and the gods by the tail, while Ananta, who sided with Nārāyaṇa, at intervals raised the snake's hood and suddenly lowered it. Black vapours with flames issued from Vāsuki's mouth, etc. After some churning the gums of various trees and herbs mingled with the waters of the Ocean, and the milky water produced clarified butter, but even then the Amṛta did not appear. The gods were tired and repaired to Brahmán, who prevailed upon Nārāyaṇa to grant the gods new strength to churn afresh. After a while the <is>Moon, Śrī, Surādevī</is> (wine), <is>Ucchaiḥ-</is> <is>śravas</is>, and <is>Kaustubha</is> came forth on the side of the gods; then <is>Dhanvantari</is> with a white vessel of Amṛta in his hand; then <is>Airāvaṇa</is>, and at last the poison <is>Kālakūṭa</is>, that <is>Śiva</is>, solicited by Brahmán, swallowed for the safety of the creation; from that time Śiva is called <is>Nīlakaṇṭha</is> (‘Blue-neck’). The Asuras preparing to rob the gods of Śrī and the Amṛta, Nārāyaṇa, assisted by his <i>māyā</i> (‘illusion’), assumed a ravishing female form; the Dānavas and Daityas were infatuated, and placed the Amṛta in her hands (I, <b>18</b>). While the Daityas and Dānavas pursued the gods, Viṣṇu with <is>Nara</is> let the gods drink of the Amṛta; the Dānava <is>Rāhu</is> also drank of it in the disguise of a god, but was discovered by <is>Sūrya</is> (i.e. the Sun) and <is>Soma</is> (i.e. the Moon); then Nārāyaṇa instantly seized his discus and cut off his head, which to this day swallows Sūrya and Soma. In a dreadful battle on the shores of the saltwater sea the gods, headed by Nārāyaṇa with his discus <is>Sudarśana</is> and Nara with his celestial bow, discomfited the Asuras, who entered the bowels of the earth or plunged into the sea of salt waters. The gods replaced Mandara on its own base, and, headed by Indra, they entrusted the keeping of the vessel of Amṛta to <is>Kirīṭin</is> (i.e. Nara), (I, <b>19</b>)."
