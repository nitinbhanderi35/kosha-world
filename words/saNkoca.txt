The story of Saṅkoca was told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira to prove the truth that even the greatest and most powerful has, one day or other, to quit life and die. Among such great ones are included Pṛthu, Aila, Maya, Bhauma, Naraka, Śambara, Hayagrīva, Pulomā, Svarbhānu, Prahlāda, Namuci, Dakṣa, Vipracitti, Virocana, Suhotra, Vṛṣa, Vṛṣabha, Kapilāśva, Virūpa, Bāṇa, Kārtasvara, and Viśvadaṃṣṭra. Though all of them were once emperors they had to give room to the next generation. Bhīṣma, on his bed of arrows, was thus describing the transience of life. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 277)."
