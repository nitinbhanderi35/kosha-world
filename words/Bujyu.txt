When the boat in which they sailed had reached mid-ocean, it was caught in a storm and wrecked. The prince and the soldiers sank into the sea. At that time the prince prayed to the Aśvins who saved Bhujyu from drowning and carried him back to the palace in boats and chariots travelling through the air. This story is given in the Ṛgveda where the adventures of Aśvins are described. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 17th Anuvāka, 116th Sūkta.)."
