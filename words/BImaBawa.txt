The following story has reference to his past life. <dvsn n='NI'/>On the death of Śrutadhara, king of Ekalavyanagara the younger of his two sons, Satyadhara drove out of the kingdom the elder brother, Śiladhara. Thus ousted from his kingdom Śīladhara did due penance and got from Śiva the boon that Satyadhara be killed while he himself be made a gandharva. Owing to the blessing of Śiva Satyadhara died, and he was born again as Samarabhaṭa, son of Ugrabhaṭa, King of Rādhānagara, and Śīladhara was born as Bhīmabhaṭa, brother of Samarabhaṭa. On the death of Ugrabhaṭa Bhīmabhaṭa, after killing Samarabhaṭa ascended the throne. And, on one of those days, he was transformed into a wild elephant as the result of the curse of a muni. But, he remembered his previous existence, and, though turned into elephant could speak like men. Bhīmabhaṭa became a gandharva because he received and treated well once a traveller and related to him his (Bhīmabhaṭa's) own story. (Kathāsaritsāgara Śaśāṃkavatīlaṃbaka)."
