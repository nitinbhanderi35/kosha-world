Prāṇavāyu has got seven forms:— <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Pravaha.</i> This vāyu makes lightning in the sky. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Āvaha.</i> It is by this vāyu that the stars shine and waters of the ocean go up as water-vapour and down as rains. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Udvaha.</i> This vāyu makes movements among the clouds and produces thunder. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Saṃvaha.</i> This vāyu beats the mountains. Saṃvaha is also engaged in shaping the clouds and producing thunder. <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Vyavaha.</i> Preparing holy water in the sky and making Ākāśagaṅgā stay there static is the work of this vāyu. <dvsn n='NI'/>6) <i>Parivaha.</i> This vāyu gives strength to one who sits in meditation. <dvsn n='NI'/>7) <i>Parāvaha.</i> It is this vāyu that fans the devas to make them cool.
