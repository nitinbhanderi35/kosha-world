It asserts duality द्वैतं, or the co-existence of two principles in the universe, viz. spirit and matter. Its doctrines being opposed to the oneness of the Vedas led to the formation of another school called the Vedānta or Uttara-Mīmānasā system, asserting the opposite idea of unity एकत्वं or अद्वैतं, and shewing that the end or aim of the Vedas was to inculcate the oneness of Spirit or God) सांख्यः, सांख्यदर्शनं; ‘with the commentary,’ सांख्यकारिका."
