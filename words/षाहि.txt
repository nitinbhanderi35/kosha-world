From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjective of Ṣāhi as Goyal<sup>429</sup> has surmised and has identified it with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family. <dvsn n='P'/>Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas; so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.<sup>430</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Goyal<sup>431</sup> identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians. The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as ‘Shāh of Iran’. <dvsn n='P'/>Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some relation with Sanskrit root <i>§śās</i> to rule, which when formed a noun means ‘a ruler’. <sup>432</sup> The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni and Kalhaṇa. <dvsn n='P'/>The word <i>Śāha</i> or <i>Sāhu,</i> often used for banias in villages, is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from Sanskrit <i>‘sādhu’.</i><sup>433</sup>"
