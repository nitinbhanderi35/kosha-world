            "content": "22. <i>Vāhlika</i>¦ (No. 20, L. 2): The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the <i>dig-</i> <i>vijaya</i> of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga countries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemies who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom, having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river) Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.<sup>526</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our inscription (No. 20) <i>‘Vāhlikāḥ’,</i> i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.<sup>527</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,<sup>528</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>529</sup> places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the modern Beas. The reading <i>Vāhlīkān</i> in the passage quoted from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for <i>Vāhīkān.</i> Numerous passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka country.<sup>530</sup> <dvsn n='P'/><i>‘Vāhīka’</i> was, in fact, a general term for the whole of Punjab. We know Śākala as <i>Vāhīka-grāma</i> from Patañjali and also <i>Pātanaprastha</i> which is modern Pathankot by the same term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and Punjab as two separate entities. <sup>531</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named <i>Vahi</i> and <i>Hika;</i> their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation of Prajāpati”.<sup>532</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika, Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands of these tribes which lived close to one another became in course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its analogical connection with the word <i>‘bahis’</i> may have been another cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.<sup>533</sup> This is also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the word ‘Vāhīka’ from <i>‘vahis’</i> or <i>‘bahis’,</i> meaning ‘outside’ (the pale of Āryandom).<sup>534</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Some scholars<sup>535</sup> rely on the description of the Bāhlikas as the offspring of two Piśācas, <i>Bahi</i> and <i>Hika,</i> as given in the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as Vāhīka.<sup>536</sup> But we have already shown that the two were separate entities. <dvsn n='P'/>We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu (Indus),<sup>537</sup> but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).<sup>538</sup> So Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme north of Afghanistan.<sup>539</sup> Bajpai<sup>540</sup> opposes it on the ground that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed the Hindukush to crush them. <dvsn n='P'/>But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from the lines in our inscription<sup>541</sup> that king Candra had conquered the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river Indus. <dvsn n='P'/>So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;<sup>542</sup> here the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the <i>Mūjavants,</i> the <i>Mahāvṛṣas,</i> and the <i>Balhikas.</i> The Mūjavants are quite certainly a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from <i>bahis,</i> ‘without’),<sup>543</sup> still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern tribe.<sup>544</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā<sup>545</sup> mentions a Kuru king named Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name Balhika.<sup>546</sup> He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātīpeya of the Mahābhārata.<sup>547</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question<sup>548</sup> says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri<sup>549</sup> suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia, and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was earlier advocated by Roth<sup>550</sup> and Weber.<sup>551</sup> But Zimmer<sup>552</sup> rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian influence.<sup>553</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples<sup>554</sup> The Account of fifty-six countries<sup>555</sup> is interesting as it mentions them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra<sup>556</sup> Bāhlīka is described as famous for horses and situated to the east of Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the basis of reference in the Mahābhārata<sup>557</sup> places the Vāhlikas in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.<sup>558</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)<sup>559</sup> mentions Bāhlāyana and derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.<sup>560</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara and the Rāmāyaṇa<sup>561</sup> place the Vāhlika country in the northern division.<sup>562</sup> Bāhlika is the name of a person in the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.<sup>563</sup> The Nāṭyaśāstra<sup>564</sup> of Bharata says that Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas). A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.<sup>565</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,<sup>566</sup> Bāhlīka is grouped with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western division. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men being married to a single woman as in <i>strīrājya (strīrājye ca</i> <i>Bāhlike...</i>), appears to be an outlandish custom prevailing in the regions to the west of India.<sup>567</sup> The Jayamaṅgalā commentary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.<sup>568</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in two ways:"
