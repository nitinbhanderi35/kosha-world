Āśvamedhika(ṃ) parva(n)). § 778: <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said (XIV, 1): After <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> had offered libations of water [to Bhīṣma], <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> fell down in grief on the bank of <i>Gaṅgā</i>. Incited by <i>Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma</i> took him up, surrounded by the <i>Pāṇḍavas; Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> comforts him, saying that it is he and <i>Gāndhārī</i> who ought to grieve, and referring to <i>Vidura's</i> advice about abandoning <i>Duryodhana</i> and his warnings against <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śakuni</i> (XIV, 1). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> also exhorts him, referring to the duties of the <i>kṣattriyas</i> expounded by <i>Bhīṣma, Vyāsa, Nārada</i>, and <i>Vidura. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> cannot forget the slaughter of <i>Karṇa. Vyāsa</i> also comforts him (XIV, <b>2</b>), and reminding him that D. and As. perform sacrifices, and that by sacrifices D. vanquished Dā., he urged him to perform the <i>Rājasūya</i>, the Horse-sacrifice, the <i>Sarva-</i> <i>medha</i>, and the <i>Naramedha</i>; [especially] the Horse-sacrifice after the example of <i>Rāma Dāśarathi</i> and <i>Bharata Dauṣmanti</i>, and indicated to him a spot in the <i>Himavat</i>, where there was gold in abundance, left behind by the brahmans at the sacrifice of <i>Marutta</i> of the <i>Karandhama</i> race. Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa</i> told the history of <i>Marutta</i> (XIV, <b>3</b>) ** i.e. <is>Saṃvartta-Maruttīya</is> (<i>b). Vaiśampāyana</i> said: † <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was delighted at hearing the speech of <i>Vyāsa</i>, and desirous of performing his sacrifices with those riches, he consulted with his ministers (XIV, <b>4—10</b>).—§ 779: <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: When <i>Vyāsa</i> had concluded his speech, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> addressed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, saying that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> <i>karman</i> has not yet been annihilated, nor had his foes been subjugated—“How canst thou be ignorant of the enemies in thy own flesh?”—and related the history of <i>Indra's</i> war with <is>Vṛtra</is> (<i>b</i>) (XIV, <b>11</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> then expounds that, as physical ailments and health depend on the distribution of the cold, warm, and windy [humours] of the body, so do the mental ailments and health depend on <i>sattva, rajas</i>, and <i>tamas</i> in the soul [mind]; happiness is overcome by sorrow, and sorrow by pleasure; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> should not recall his past sorrows: <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> in the assembly, etc. (α); “the time has now come when thou must fight single-handed with thy mind” (XIV, <b>12</b>); salvation is not attained by foregoing external things; <i>Mṛtyu</i> (death) is [the thought] “mine,” and the eternal <i>Brāhman</i> is [the thought] “not mine”; as no creature is ever destroyed, <i>ahiṃsā</i> (absence of injury) may exist even when one has pierced [a creature's] body, and <i>vice versa</i>; († v. 339—341): † the <i>yogin</i> knows <i>yoga</i> to be the perfect way, on account of the practices of his many former births; quoting the old verses sung by <i>Kāma</i>: “no creature is able to destroy me without [resorting to] the [proper] methods [i.e. subjugation of all desires, practice of <i>yoga</i>, etc.]…” (XIV, <b>13</b>).—§ 780: <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: Thus <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was consoled, exhorted by <i>Viṣṭaraśravas</i>, etc. (β); and having again performed the obsequial rites for his relatives, etc., he ruled the earth. He said to <i>Vyāsa</i>, <i>Nārada</i>, etc., that he would now perform the sacrifice, and said that they would go to the <i>Himālaya</i> under the protection of <i>Vyāsa</i> [to fetch the gold], according to the words of <i>Vyāsa</i>, D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>, and <i>Devasthāna</i>. Then M.-ṛ. took leave of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa</i>, and <i>Arjuna</i>. A short time passed away while they performed their purifications after <i>Bhīṣma's</i> death, and gave large gifts to the brahmans as <i>śrāddha (aurddhvadehikaṃ</i>) to the <i>Kurus Bhīṣma, Karṇa</i>, etc., accompanied by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and then they entered the city of <i>Hāstinapura</i> (XIV, <b>14</b>).—§ 781: Asked by <i>Janamejaya</i> what <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> did when the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had reconquered and pacified their kingdom, <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: When the <i>Pāṇḍava</i>-kingdom had been conquered and pacified <i>K</i>. and <i>A</i>. travelled with great pleasure amidst picturesque sceneries, like <i>Indra</i> and his wife (?, so PCR.) (<i>deveśvarau</i>) in heaven, or like the <i>Aśvins</i> in <i>Nandana</i>, and [then] entered the palace of <i>Indraprastha</i> in great merriment, reciting the genealogies of Ṛ. and gods, etc., and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> consoled <i>Arjuna</i> for the death of his relatives (α). It was long since he had seen <i>Vasudeva, Baladeva</i>, and the <i>Vṛṣṇi</i>heroes; he, therefore, asked leave to go to <i>Dvāravatī</i>, and to accompany him to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and apprise him of his departure. († v. 404—6): <i>Arjuna</i> sorrowfully replied, “Be it so” (XIV, <b>15</b>)."
