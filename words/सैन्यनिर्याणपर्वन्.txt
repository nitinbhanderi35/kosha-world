Sainyaniryāṇa). § 570: The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had seven <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> led by <i>Drupada</i>, etc. (α). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> consulted with his brothers about the election of a generalissimo, who might also withstand <i>Bhīṣma. Sahadeva</i>, etc., proposed <i>Virāṭa</i>, etc. (β). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> named <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, who was elected. Then they marched out to <i>Kurukṣetra</i> (description), with <i>Bhīma</i> in the van, etc. (γ). <i>Draupadī</i> with her ladies, etc., remained at <i>Upaplavya</i>. The <i>Kekaya</i> princes, etc. (δ) marched behind <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, keeping him in their centre. In the rear were <i>Virāṭa</i>, etc. (ε), 40,000 chariots, etc. <i>Anādhṛṣṭi</i>, etc. (ζ) marched surrounding <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>. Entering <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, they blew their conches, also <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>; <i>Pāñcajanya</i> filled them with joy (V, <b>152</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> encamped on <i>Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (η) each did some special work. At the holy <i>Hiraṇvatī</i> (an excellent <i>tīrtha</i>, with sacred water, without pointed pebbles and mire), <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> caused a moat to be excavated. There were assembled hundreds upon hundreds of skilled mechanics in receipt of regular wages, and surgeons and physicians, etc. Then their allies began to march thither (V, <b>152</b>). When <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had departed, <i>Duryodhana</i> urged <i>Kaṛna, Duḥśāsana</i>, and <i>Śakuni</i> to make preparations for battle, which was fixed to commence the next morning (I, <b>153</b>). At the request of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa</i> related <i>Duryodhana's</i>, etc., project of imprisoning him; “neither <i>Bhīṣma</i> nor <i>Droṇa</i> said anything on that subject; indeed, all of them follow <i>Duryodhana</i>, except <i>Vidura…</i> War is that which should now take place.” <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> gave order to array the troops, but then he complained that he should slay his preceptors, etc. <i>Arjuna</i> reminded him of what <i>Kuntī</i> and <i>Vidura</i> had said through <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> affirmed it. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and their soldiers passed the night in great happiness (V, <b>154</b>). After that night had passed away, <i>Duryodhana</i> arranged his eleven <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> (description), under <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc. (θ) (V, <b>155</b>). Referring to a contest between the <i>brahmans</i>, whom also the <i>vaiśyas</i> and the <i>śūdras</i> followed, and the <i>kṣatriyas</i> among the <i>Haihayas (b), Duryodhana</i> urged <i>Bhīṣma</i> to become their generalissimo. <i>Bhīṣma</i> said that he did not see upon earth the warrior that was equal to him, except <i>Arjuna</i>; but <i>Arjuna</i> would never openly fight with him; <i>Bhīṣma</i> said he could, in a trice, destroy the universe with D., As., Rā., and men; but the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> he could not exterminate; but he would slay every day 10,000; and either <i>Karṇa</i> or <i>Bhīṣma</i> should fight first. <i>Karṇa</i> declared he would not fight before <i>Bhīṣma</i> was slain; then he would fight with <i>Arjuna</i>. Then <i>Bhīṣma</i> was solemnly installed, under a bloody shower, etc. Then they marched out to <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> caused the camps to be measured out on a level part of the plain (V, <b>156</b>). When <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> heard that <i>Bhīṣma</i> had been installed in the command of the <i>Kuru</i> army, he summoned his brothers and <i>Vāsudeva</i>, and selected seven leaders for his seven <i>akṣauhiṇīs: Drupada</i>, etc. (ι) (cf. α!), and above them all <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>; and <i>Dhanañjaya</i> (i.e. <i>Arjuna</i>) of curly hair was made the leader of all those leaders; and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> the leader of <i>Arjuna</i> and driver of his steeds. <i>Halāyudha</i> (i.e. <i>Balarāma</i>), etc. (κ) came there, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (λ) rose from their seats and offered worship to <i>Halāyudha. Halāyudha</i> said that a fierce slaughter was inevitable, that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> would certainly win because of the help of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, that he had repeatedly tried to prevail upon <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to remain neuter; that he would himself do; but as he could not be without <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, he would repair to the <i>tīrthas</i> of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>. Then he set out for his <i>tīrthayātrā</i> (V, <b>157</b>). About this time there came to the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> camp <i>Bhīṣmaka's (c</i>) son <i>Rukmin (d</i>). He entered the camp with an <i>akṣauhiṇī</i> of troops, from desire of doing what was agreeable to <i>Vāsudeva</i>. He offered <i>Arjuna</i> his assistance, if he was afraid. He would slay everyone: <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (μ). <i>Arjuna</i>, mentioning his exploits against the <i>G.</i>, at <i>Khāṇḍava</i>, against the <i>Nivātakavacas</i> and <i>Kālakeyas</i>, at <i>Virāṭa's</i> city, and that he had paid his respects for battle's sake to <i>Rudra</i>, etc. (ν), would not say he was afraid. <i>Rakmin</i> then went to <i>Duryodhana</i>, saying the same words, and was rejected in the same way. Then the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> again consulted, presided over by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (V, <b>158</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> to tell him all that had happened in the matter of encamping, and complained that though he understood the defects, he could not withstand <i>Duryodhana. Sañjaya</i> said that he ought not to impute the fault only to <i>Duryodhana</i>: “as to our acts, some say that everything is ordained by God; some that they are the result of free-will; others that they are the result of those of our past lives” (V, <b>159</b>)."
