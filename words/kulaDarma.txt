Arjuna told the following about Kuladharmas to Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra. <dvsn n='NI'/>In the decline of a family, its time-honoured usages perish; with the perishing of such rites impiety overtakes the entire family. <dvsn n='NI'/>With the growth of impiety even the noble women become unchaste, and if women become corrupt, mixture of castes ensues. <dvsn n='NI'/>Hell is verily the lot of the family and family-destroyers through caste admixture; for, their ancestors fall deprived of balls of rice and libations. <dvsn n='NI'/>The ever-lasting caste virtues and the family merits get ruined because of the chaos in the caste system. We have heard that hell is verily the long-lasting abode of the men whose family religious practices have been broken. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 25 and the Gītā)."
