This mountain stands in a place having an area of thirteen yojanas, on the opposite shore of the sea where the water-creatures fall with tremendous cry at the mouth of the submarine fire (Baḍavāgni). The monkeys sent by Sugrīva to search for Sītā, made a search in this mountain also. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 40, Stanza 50)."
