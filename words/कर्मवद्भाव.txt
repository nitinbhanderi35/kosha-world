            "word": "कर्मवद्भाव",
            "content": "the activity of the agent or kartā of an action represented as object or karman of that very action, for the sake of grammatical operations: e. g. भिद्यते काष्ठं स्वयमेव;. करिष्यते कटः स्वयमेव. To show facility of a verbal activity on the object, when the agent or kartā is dispensed with, and the object is looked upon as the agent, and used also as an agent, the verbal terminations ति, त; etc. are not applied in the sense of an agent, but they are applied in the sense of an object; consequently the sign of the voice is not अ (शप्), but य (यक्) and the verbal terminations are त, आताम् etc. (तङ्) instead of ति, तस् etc. In popular language the use of an expression of this type is called Karmakartari-Prayoga. For details see M. Bh. on कर्मवत्कर्मणा तुल्यक्रियः P.III.1.87. Only such roots as are कर्मस्थक्रियक or कर्मस्थभावक i.e. roots whose verbal activity is noticed in the object and not in the subject can have this Karmakartari-Prayoga."
