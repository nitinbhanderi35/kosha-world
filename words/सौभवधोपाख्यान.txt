Arjunābh.). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> related: When <i>Śiśupāla</i>, the son of <i>Damaghoṣa</i>, had been slain, his brother, the <i>Mārttikā-</i> <i>vata</i>-king <i>Śālva</i>, in order to avenge him, came to <i>Dvārakā</i> in the <i>Saubha</i>, who moved at will and slew many of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, and sought for <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> desiring to kill him. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was in <i>Indraprastha</i> at the <i>rājasūya</i> of Yudhiṣṭhira, and when he learnt this on returning home, he set out to slay him, and found him in an island in the ocean (see Nīl. and PCR.; BR. “a bay”), and blowing his conch <i>Pāñcajanya</i>, slew numerous <i>Dānavas</i>. Then, as soon as he heard of the game at dice, he had come to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (III, <b>14</b>).—§ 320. Copious description of the combats with <i>Śālva</i>: When <i>Śālva</i> attacked <i>Dvārakā</i> it was well furnished and strongly fortified (description of fortifications and measures taken to defend the city by <i>Ugrasena, Uddhava</i>, etc.) and defended by <i>Gada, Śāmba</i>, etc. (III, <b>15</b>). <i>Cārudeṣṇa</i> (son of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Rukmiṇī</i>), <i>Śāmba</i> (son of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Jāmbavatī</i>), and <i>Pradyumna</i> (son of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Rukmiṇī</i>) rushed out against him. They on both sides fought by means of <i>māyā. Śāmba</i> put <i>Kṣemarṛddhi</i>, the commander of <i>Śālva's</i> troops, to flight by a shower of arrows, and slew a <i>Daiteya</i> named <i>Vegavat</i> with his mace. <i>Cārudeṣṇa</i> slew the <i>Dānava Vivindhya</i> with a consecrated arrow. Then <i>Śālva</i>, riding on <i>Saubha</i>, encountered <i>Pradyumna</i> (III, <b>16</b>). Riding on his chariot with a gaping <i>makara</i> in its standard, <i>Pradyumna</i> with showers of arrows slew the <i>Dānavas</i> and pierced the heart of <i>Śālva</i> so that he fell in a swoon, but he rose again and wounded <i>Pradyumna</i> about his throat so that he became senseless (III, <b>17</b>). <i>Pradyumna's</i> charioteer <i>Dāruki</i>, a <i>sūta</i>, carried him off the field by the help of his fleet steeds, but when <i>Pradyumna</i> had regained his senses, he ordered him to turn the chariot, reminding him of the customs of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> in battle, and saying that he had restrained <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, the son of <i>Hṛdika</i>, from sallying out, as he would himself resist <i>Śālva</i> (III, <b>18</b>). As Śālva used his <i>māyā</i> of the <i>Asuras, Pradyumna</i> shot him down with the <i>Brahmāstra</i>, and was about to aim another arrow at him, capable of killing any person, when all the hosts of the gods, with <i>Indra</i> and <i>Dhaneśvara</i> (i.e. Kubera), sent <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Śvasana</i> (i.e. the Wind), who ordered him to desist as the creator (<i>Dhātṛ</i>) had destined <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, the son of <i>Devakī</i>, to slay him. <i>Śālva</i> then mounted <i>Saubha</i> and went away through the skies leaving <i>Dvārakā</i> (III, <b>19</b>). When <i>Śālva</i> had left <i>Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa</i> returned from the <i>rājasūya</i>, and found <i>Dvārakā</i> deprived of its splendour, etc. He learnt from <i>Hārdikya</i> (i.e. Kṛtavarman) about the invasion of <i>Śālva</i>, committed the city to the charge of king <i>Āhuka</i> and <i>Ānakadundubhi</i> (i.e. Vasudeva), etc., bowed to <i>Bhava</i> (i.e. Śiva), and set out on his chariot yoked with <i>Śaibya</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i> and with <i>Dāruka</i> for his charioteer, blowing the <i>Pāñcajanya</i>, till he arrived at <i>Mārttikāvata</i>, and pursued <i>Śālva</i> (<i>Daiteyāpasadaḥ</i>, v. 796), who, staying in <i>Saubha</i>, remained in the sky above the midst of the ocean a <i>krośa</i> off, so that <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> soldiers could not see it, but were obliged to stand as mere spectators. After a long battle with arrows, in which <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> killed numerous <i>Dānavas</i>, they took to fight by means of illusion, whirling maces, ploughshares, etc., and then mountain peaks. As none could ascertain whether it was day or night, or distinguish the points of the horizon, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, becoming bewildered, made use of the <i>Prajñāstra</i>, by which he regained light (III, <b>20</b>). <i>Dāruka</i> was covered all over with shafts. Then a messenger of <i>Āhuka</i> came from <i>Dvārakā</i>, saying that <i>Śālva</i> had come to <i>Dvārakā</i> and had slain <i>Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa</i> thought that then <i>Sātyaki, Baladeva</i>, <i>Pradyumna, Cārudeṣṇa, Śāmba</i>, etc., must necessarily have been killed first. Now he saw <i>Vasudeva</i> falling from <i>Saubha</i>, and swooned away; but, as he, after regaining consciousness, saw neither <i>Saubha</i>, nor <i>Śālva</i>, nor <i>Vasudeva</i>, he concluded that it was illusion (III, <b>21</b>). Though <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> could not see <i>Saubha</i>, which had vanished through illusion, he discharged many arrows from the <i>Śārṅga</i>. The <i>Dānavas</i> set up a loud howl, and when <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, making use of a weapon that pierced the foe following the sound, killed them at one place, the yell ceased at that place and started from another quarter. Then <i>Saubha</i> reappeared at <i>Prāgjyotiṣa. Kṛṣṇa, Dāruka</i>, and the horses were covered by torrents of rocks that concealed them, and the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> fled in all directions. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> then destroyed the crags with <i>Indra's</i> thunderbolt, <i>Dāruka</i> pointed at <i>Śālva</i> and exhorted <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to slay him. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> made use of his <i>Āgneya</i> weapon and hurled his discus <i>Sudarśana (b</i>) against the city of <i>Saubha</i>, that fell cut in twain like the city of <i>Tripura</i> by the shafts of <i>Maheśvara</i>. Then the discus came back into his hands and was hurled against <i>Śālva</i> and cut him in twain. The remaining <i>Dānavas</i> fled in fear. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> returned to the <i>Ānarttas</i>. It was for this reason that he could not come to <i>Hāstinapura</i> and prevent the gambling.—§ 321: Then <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> took leave of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc., and set out for <i>Dvārakā</i> in his chariot yoked with <i>Śaibya</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i>, taking with him <i>Subhadrā</i> and <i>Abhimanyu</i>. Then <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> set out for his own city, taking with him the <i>Draupadeyas</i>. And the <i>Cedi</i> king, <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i> (<i>Śiśupāla's</i> son, Nīl.), set out for his beautiful city of <i>Śuktimatī</i>, taking with him his sister [<i>Kareṇumatī</i>, the wife of <i>Nakula</i>; Nīl., v. I, 3831]. Also the Kaikeyas (B. <i>Kekayāḥ</i>; <i>Sahadevaśyālāḥ</i>, Nīl.) went away. But the brahmans, <i>vaiśyas</i>, and inhabitants of the country would not leave the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in due time ordered his men to make the chariots ready (III, <b>22</b>).
