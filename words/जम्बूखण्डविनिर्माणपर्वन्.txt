            "content": "[<b>Jambūkhaṇḍavinirmāṇaparvan</b>¦ (<i>°va</i>)] (“the section relating to the measurement of Jambūkhaṇḍa,” the 67th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. °vinirmāṇa). § 574: <i>Janamejaya</i> inquired how the <i>Kurus</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Somakas</i> fought on <i>Kurukṣetra. Vaiśampāyana</i> began the description of the battle. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> occupied the western part, turned towards the east, beyond <i>Samantapañcaka</i>. The force was collected from the whole of <i>Jambudvīpa. Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> fixed watchwords. Seeing <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> (description), the <i>Pāñcālas</i> were filled with joy, and blew their conches, etc.; <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> also blew their conches <i>Devadatta</i> and <i>Pāñcajanya</i>, at which the <i>Kurus</i> were alarmed. Various ill omens were beheld. Both parties <is>settled</is> <is>rules and made covenants</is> regarding the different kinds of combat (VI, <b>1</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> visited <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and offered to grant him spiritual vision that he might witness the battle. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> did not like to see the slaughter of his kinsmen. <i>Vyāsa</i> then granted it to <i>Sañjaya</i>, that he might narrate everything to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>; weapons would not hurt him; he would come out of the battle with life. <i>Vyāsa</i> informed <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> of the omens (α), and appealed to him for peace; but <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> urged the disobedience of his sons. <i>Vyāsa</i> enumerated to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> the omens that indicate victory, and recommended negotiation, as victory was uncertain (VI, <b>2, 3</b>). Then <i>Vyāsa</i> departed. Seeing the many hundreds of millions of men that had come together at <i>Kurujāṅgala</i> to lay down their very lives for the sake of the earth, <i>Dhṛtarā-</i> <i>ṣṭra</i> inquired of <i>Sañjaya</i> after the attributes of Earth, and the details about the countries and cities from which they had come. <i>Sañjaya</i> discoursed on the merits of the earth, and the various classes of creatures inhabiting it. Their twenty-four constituents are described as <i>Gāyatrī</i> (VI, <b>4</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> inquired about the rivers, mountains, and provinces of the earth, and their dimensions. <i>Sañjaya</i> spoke of the five elements and their attributes, earth being the foremost. Then he began the <is>description</is> of the dvīpa of <i>Sudarśana</i> (VI, <b>5</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> discoursed on the six mountains (<i>varṣaparvatāḥ</i>, B.) that extend from the eastern to the western ocean, and are the resort of Si. and Cā.: <i>Himavat</i>; etc. (β), and the <i>varṣas</i> between them—<i>Bhārata-varṣa</i>, etc. (γ); <i>Mālyavat, Gandhamādana; Meru</i> (description); the four islands beside <i>Meru—Bhadrāśva</i>, etc. (δ); the bird <i>Sumukha</i> (<i>b</i>); on <i>Meru</i> sport D., G., As., Rā., and Aps., and <i>Brahmán, Rudra</i>, and <i>Śakra</i> perform sacrifices; <i>Tumburu</i>, etc. (ε), adore the gods with hymns; the seven <i>Ṛṣis</i> and <i>Kaśyapa</i> repair thither on every <i>parvan</i>-day (i.e. the day of full moon and that of new moon); upon the summit is <i>Uśanas</i> with the <i>Daityas</i>; the jewels, etc., come from <i>Meru</i>, one-fourth part being enjoyed by <i>Kubera</i>, who gives only one-sixteenth to men. On the northern side of <i>Meru</i> is a forest of <i>karṇi-</i> <i>kāras</i>; there <i>Paśupati</i> (the creator of all things), together with his celestial attendants and <i>Umā</i>, sports, bearing a chain of <i>karṇikāra</i> flowers reaching down to his feet, and his three eyes resembling three suns; the <i>Siddhas</i> can behold him, but not persons of wicked conduct; from the summit of that mountain <i>Gaṅgā (c</i>) falls down. On the western side of <i>Meru</i> is <i>Ketumāla (d</i>), and also <i>Jambūkhaṇḍa, Gandhamādana</i> (<i>e</i>). The last <i>varṣa</i> in the north and <i>Bharata's varṣa</i> in the south are both of the form of a bow. Amongst these seven <i>varṣas</i> that which is further north excels the one to its immediate south in respect of longevity, stature, health, righteousness, pleasure, and profit. The huge mountains of <i>Hemakūṭa</i> are also called <i>Kailāsa</i>, where <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> (i.e. Kubera) lives in joy with Gh. To the north of <i>Kailāsa</i> and near the mountains of <i>Maināka</i> there is the huge and beautiful mountain <i>Hiraṇyaśṛṅga</i>. Beside this the delightful lake <i>Bindusaras (f</i>), with golden sands. Rā. reside on <i>Himavat</i>, etc. (θ). The two dvīpas <i>Nāgadvīpa</i> and <i>Kaśyapadvīpa</i> are the two ears of this hare-shaped region; the beautiful mountains of <i>Malaya</i>, having rocks like copper plates, form another part of <i>Jambūdvīpa</i>, making it resemble a hare (VI, <b>6</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> about the regions to the north and the east side of <i>Meru</i>, and about the mountains of <i>Mālyavat. Sañjaya</i> told about the <i>Uttarakurus (Uttarāḥ</i> <i>Kuravaḥ) (g</i>). East of <i>Meru</i> the foremost region is <i>Bhadrāśva</i> (<i>h</i>). The <i>jambū</i> tree (<i>i). Mālyavat (j</i>) (VI, <b>7</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> inquired about the names of all the <i>varṣas</i> and mountains. <i>Sañjaya</i> related of <i>Ramaṇaka</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> became absorbed in meditation about his sons; then he said: “Time destroys and creates everything; <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, omniscient, destroying all creatures (<i>sarvabhūtahṛt</i>), the gods call him <i>Vaikuṇṭha</i>, men call him <i>Viṣṇu</i>” (VI, <b>8</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked about <i>Bhārata-varṣa (k</i>), about which <i>Duryodhana</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> are so covetous. <i>Sañjaya</i> said that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were not covetous about it, but <i>Duryodhana</i>, <i>Śakuni</i>, etc.; then he mentioned in <i>Bhārata-varṣa</i>, the beloved land of <i>Indra</i>, etc. (αα), inhabited by <i>Aryans</i> and <i>Mlecchas</i>, the mountains—<i>Mahendra</i>, etc. (κ); rivers (“all mothers of the universe and productive of great merit”)— <i>Gaṅgā</i>, etc. (λ); countries—<i>Kuru-Pāñcālāḥ</i>, etc. (μ); and countries in the south—<i>Draviḍāḥ</i>, etc. (ν); the tribes of the north—<i>Mlecchāḥ</i>, etc. (ξ); and in the east and the north— <i>Śūdrābhīrāḥ</i>, etc. (ο) (VI, <b>9</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> inquired about life, strength, etc., in <i>Bhārata-varṣa</i>, and of <i>Haimavata-varṣa</i> and <i>Harivarṣa. Sañjaya</i> related of the four <i>yugas—Kṛta</i>, etc. (π). The portion that remains of the <i>Dvāpara</i> age is small. <i>Haimavata-varṣa</i> is superior to <i>Bhārata-varṣa</i>, and <i>Harivarṣa</i> superior to <i>Haimavata-varṣa</i>, in every respect (VI, <b>10</b>)."
