They were inseparable companions of Mahābali. Praheti was unmarried and spent his time in religious pursuits. Heti married Bhayā sister of Kāla and got a son named Vidyutkeśa. Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā daughter of Sandhyā and got a son named Sukeśa Sukeśa married Devavatī, daughter of Grāmaṇī, alias Maṇimāyā. Devavatī delivered three sons, Mālī Sumālī and Mālyavān. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Boon to Mālī.</i> The three brothers, even while young decided to acquire great strength and started performing penance. When their penance became very fierce Brahmā appeared before them in person and asked them what boon they wanted. They said, ‘We must be invincible, we must be destroyers of our enemies, we must have long life, we must become rich and powerful ever remaining friendly with each other”. Brahmā granted the boon asked for. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Family life.</i> After obtaining the boon they went to Viśvakarmā and asked him to construct a place of abode for them. Viśvakarmā was frightened and he hastened to suggest a beautiful place for them to live. He said, “There is a mountain named Trikūṭa on the shores of the southern sea. There is a mountain on it called Subala. Its main top grazes the sky. Its four sides have been beautifully chiselled. No birds fly to its top. I have constructed there at the request of Indra a beautiful city surrounded by walls of gold and adorned on all sides with festoons of gold. That city is called Laṅkā and you, demon-lords, can stay there. You will get glory and prestige which even Indra could not acquire in his Amarāvatī. If you live in Laṅkā with your followers you will be unconquerable”. <dvsn n='NI'/>The happy demons with their people went to Laṅkā. They married the daughters of a Gandharva woman named Narmadā. Mālī married Vasudhā; Sumālī, Ketumatī; and Mālyavān, Sundarī. Mālī begot of his wife Vasudhā four sons named Anila, Anala, Hara and Sampāti. Sumālī got of his wife Ketumatī ten sons named Prahasta, Akampana, Vikaṭa, Kālakāmukha, Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃhrāda, Prakvātā and Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters named Vekā, Puṣpotkaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Death.</i> The three brothers attacked Devaloka under the leadership of Mālī and a great fight ensued and Mālī died by the discus of Mahāviṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa)."
