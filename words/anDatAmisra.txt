This hell is destined for wives who cheat their husbands and consume food and for husbands who cheat their wives and eat food. Agents of Yama get hold of such sinners and push them into the Andhatāmisra. As the cords of the agents with which they bind the sinners get tighter around their bodies they faint and fall down owing to unbearable pain. When they regain consciousness and try to run away and escape, the Agents of Yama again bind them with the cord. (Devī Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha)."
