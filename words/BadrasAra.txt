The father tried his best to withdraw his son from this excessive devotion but failed. <dvsn n='NI'/>Then one day the great sage, Parāśara, came to the King as his guest and the King then requested him to make his son withdraw from his Śiva-worship. But Parāśara then told him about the previous life of Sudharmā and consoling him persuaded the King to do the ‘Rudrābhiṣeka’ (uninterrupted pouring of cold water over an idol of Śiva) by himself. The king then entrusted the state with his son and left for the forests accepting an ascetic life. (Skandha Purāṇa, 3.3.20-21)."
