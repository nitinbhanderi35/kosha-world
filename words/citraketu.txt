But, ere long the child was dead and gone, and its parents, immersed in sorrow took the dead child to Aṅgiras. Nārada also happened to be there on the occasion. Aṅgiras restored the dead child to life and asked him to live with the parents. The boy immediately stood up and told Aṅgiras that he had many parents in his many previous lives, and requested to be enlightened as to which of those parents he was to live with. Brahmā and Nārada felt confused. In the end they disappeared after imparting spiritual wisdom to Citraketu. And, Citraketu, who, for eight days immersed himself in concentrating the mind on God was turned into a Gandharva; his wife too turned Gandharva. <dvsn n='NI'/>And, both of them rose up in the sky and flying over Mount Kailāsa looked down to the mountain. There they saw Pārvatī being seated on the thighs of Śiva at which sight Citraketu laughed. Enraged by the laughter Pārvatī cursed him to be born as an asura, and he was born as such. Vṛtrāsura was Citraketu born as asura. (Bhāgavata, Saṣṭha Skandha)."
