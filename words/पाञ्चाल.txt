<i>tatreme kurūpāñcālāḥ</i>) 6. 10. 37; (<i>pāñcālāḥ kauśijāś caiva</i>) 6. 10. 40; called Janapada also in 4. 1. 9. and Rāṣṭra in 1. 128. 7; 4. 1. 8; listed by Arjuna among the Janapadas lying around the Kuru country (<i>santi ramyā janapadā … paritaḥ</i> <i>kurūn / pāñcālāś cedimatsyāś ca</i>) 4. 1. 9; to the east of Indraprastha (<i>yayau prācīṃ</i> <i>diśaṃ prati</i>) 2. 26. 1; 2. 23. 9; (also see Epic events No. 11 below); the way of Pāṇḍavas from Dvaitavana (3. 295. 2-3, 5) to the Matsya country lay between Pāñcāla to the north and Daśārṇa to the south (<i>uttareṇa daśārṇāṃs te pāñcālān dakṣi-</i> <i>ṇena tu</i>) 4. 5. 3; the <i>tīrtha</i> Utpalāvata was situated in Pāñcāla country 3. 85. 11; Pāñcāla was divided by Droṇa into northern and southern Pāñcāla, the dividing line being the river Bhāgīrathī (<i>rājāsi</i> <i>dakṣine kūle bhāgīrathyāham uttare</i>) 1. 128. 12;

(2) Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas attacked the Pāñcālas and crushed the capital town of Drupada (<i>mamṛdus tasya</i> <i>nagaraṃ drupadasya</i>) 1. 128. 4; (3) After his defeat, Drupada was allowed by Droṇa to rule over the southern Pāñcālas, with Kāmpilya as its capital 1. 128. 12, 15; (4) After their escape from Vāraṇāvata, Pāṇḍavas passed through many countries, one of them being Pāñcāla 1. 144. 2; (5) A certain Brāhmaṇa told Pāṇḍavas about the <i>svayaṃvara</i> to be held in the Pāñcāla country 1. 153. 7; (6) When Dhṛṣṭadyumna arose from the sacrificial fire, delighted Pāñcālas shouted ‘good, good’ (<i> … praṇeduḥ pāñcālāḥ prahṛṣṭāḥ sādhu</i> <i>sādhv iti</i>); an invisible being in the sky (<i>mahad bhūtam adṛśyaṃ khecaraṃ</i>) declared that Dhṛṣṭadyumna would remove the fear of the Pāñcālas and bring them fame 1. 155. 39-40; (7) When Pāñcālas heard the heavenly voice at the rise of Draupadī from the sacrificial altar, they roared like a horde of lions; the earth could not bear their burden who were filled with joy (<i>praṇeduḥ siṃhasaṃghavat / na caitān</i> <i>harṣasaṃpūrṇān iyaṃ sehe vasauṃdharā</i>) 1. 155. 46; (8) Kuntī suggested to Pāṇḍavas to go to Pāñcāla 1. 156. 6; Vyāsa too advised them to go to the town of Pāñcālas (Kāmpilya) for the <i>svayaṃvara (pāñcāla-</i> <i>nagaraṃ … praviśadhvam)</i> 1. 157. 15; travelling Brāhmaṇas advised Pāṇḍavas to do the same 1. 175. 5; (9) Pāṇḍavas started for the southern Pāñcālas and reached it 1. 176. 2, 5; this event is referred to earlier in the summary narration of the Mahābhārata in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan 1. 2. 86, and again at 1. 55. 21; (10) The southern Pāñcālas, afraid of Jarāsandha, left their land and went further south; they also fled in different directions (<i>dakṣiṇā ye ca pāñcālāḥ … tathottarāṃ</i> <i>diśam āśritāḥ // … tathaiva sarvapāñcālā</i> <i>jarāsandhabhayārditāḥ // svarāṣṭraṃ saṃ-</i> <i>parityajya vidrutāḥ sarvatodiśam //</i>) 2. 13. 26-28; (11) Bhīmasena, in his expedition to the east (<i>yayau prācīṃ diśaṃ</i> <i>prati</i> 2. 26. 1; also 2. 23. 9); before the Rājasūya, won over Pāñcālas by various means of conciliation (<i>pāñcālān vividho-</i> <i>pāyaiḥ sāntvayām āsa</i>) 2. 26. 3; this event is referred to later in 4. 5. 19 where, however, it is said that he defeated them in battle (<i>pāñcālān … saṃgrāme bhīmaseno'jayat</i>); Pāñcālas did not pay tribute for Rājasūya because they had marriage-relationship with Pāṇḍavas (<i>vaivāhikena pāñcālāḥ</i>) 2. 48. 42; (12) Vidura told Kauravas that Pāñcālas would not forgive the torture to Draupadī (in the Sabhā); Arjuna, protected by Pāñcālas, would invade them 2. 72. 29-30; (13) Pāñcālas meeting the Pāṇḍavas in the forest (3. 13. 2) referred to in the narration of the contents of the Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 106; (14) Draupadī complained to Kṛṣṇa that though Pāñcālas were alive Kauravas desired to treat Draupadī as a Dāsī 3. 13. 56; (15) Dhṛtarāṣṭra was afraid that later Pāñcālas, protected by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the Kaurava army 3. 48. 6; (16) Bhīma feared that if Arjuna (who had departed to get weapons) was dead, Pāñcālas, Pāṇḍavas and the rest would perish 3. 49. 6; (17) Bhīma told Draupadī that Pāñcālas, with the support of Arjuna, would not be afraid of even gods if they had to fight with them 3. 79. 20; (18) Before the <i>ajñātavāsa,</i> Yudhiṣṭhira asked the women who attended on Draupadī, as also cooks and chief cooks, to go to the Pāñcāla country 4. 4. 4; (19) According to Draupadī, the affliction she had to suffer while living as Sairandhrī meant insult to Kurus and Pāñcālas 4. 19. 11; (20) Karṇa told Bhīṣma that Pāṇḍavas were claiming their share because they depended on the force of Pāñcālas and Matsyas (<i>rājyam icchanti paitṛkam / balam āśritya</i> <i>matsyānāṃ pāñcālānāṃ ca</i>) 5. 21. 11; (21) Yudhiṣṭhira could have resorted to war without going into exile since the Pāñcālas were always available to him for guidance (<i>nityaṃ pāñcālāḥ sacivās tave-</i> <i>me</i>) 5. 27. 17; (22) By avoiding war, Yudhiṣṭhira wished Pāñcālas to meet Kurus with a smile; he desired both of them to remain uninjured and, well-disposed, live in peace (<i>akṣatān kurupāñcālān paśyema … </i> <i>sarve sumanasas tāta śāmyāma</i>) 5. 31. 2122; (23) Saṃjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas were waiting for the orders of Yudhiṣṭhira (<i>rājño mukham</i> <i>udīkṣante</i>); they, riding chariots, greeted him when he approached them 5. 49. 4-7; Saṃjaya also told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcālas did not honour him and that they despised him (<i>nārhanti pāñcālāś … sarve</i> <i>tvām avajānate</i>) 5. 53. 17; (24) Pāñcālas mentioned by Dhṛtarāṣṭra among those who sided with Pāṇḍavas 5. 56. 33; (25) Duryodhana assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcālas would be attacked by his chariotfighters with arrows 5. 56. 42; he also told him that he would soon hear Pāñcālas defeated by him 5. 60. 25; (26) Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas counted on Dhṛṣṭadyumna's fortitude and valour 5. 56. 51; (27) Karṇa told Duryodhana that the <i>brahmāstra</i> he had obtained from Paraśurāma was still with him and hence due to the favour of the <i>ṛṣi</i> (Paraśurāma) he would kill Pāñcālas and the rest in no time; that was his responsibility (<i>tatas tad astram mama</i> <i>sāvaśeṣaṃ / tasmāt samartho 'smi mamaiṣa</i> <i>bhāraḥ // … tam ṛṣiprasādam avāpya pāñ-</i> <i>cāla° … /nihatya</i>) 5. 61. 4-5 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 5. 62. 4: <i>sāvaśeṣaṃ mama</i> <i>āyur asti /ato 'ntakālasyānupasthitatvāt tad</i> <i>astraṃ mamāstīty ahaṃ samartho 'smi</i>); (28) Yudhiṣṭhira, although backed by Pāñcālas and others, chose to ask for five villages 5. 70. 14; (29) Even when Pāñcālas were alive, Draupadī was looked upon as a <i>dāsī</i> in the Sabhā of the wretched Kauravas 5. 80. 25; (30) Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that the Pāñcālas and others would consecrate him as king; Pāñcālas would follow him in his procession 5. 138. 16-17, 23; (31) Vidura told Kuntī that Yudhiṣṭhira was supported by Pāñcālas 5. 142. 3; there was nothing more painful to Kuntī than Pāñcālas and others fighting with Bhāratas 5. 142. 3, 12; (32) When Pāñcālas proceeded towards Kurukṣetra, they were led by Bhīmasena 5. 149. 50; (33) Duryodhana and others were to kill Pāñcālas in battle 5. 162. 22; Droṇa was to burn Pāñcālas (<i>pradhakṣyati sa pāñcā-</i> <i>lān</i>) 5. 164. 20; Pāñcālas would run in all directions when they encountered Karṇa 5. 165. 21; (34) Pāñcālas and Prabhadrakas formed the army of Śikhaṇḍin 5. 168. 3; (35) Hiraṇyavarman's friends wanted to kill Drupada and instal another king in the Pāñcāla country if Śikhaṇḍin proved to be a girl 5. 191. 8; (36) Saṃjaya reported that Bhīṣma showered arrows on Pāñcālas 6. 15. 25; on the first day of war, Bhīṣma's chariot moved very often among Pāñcālas and he killed them 6. 45. 4, 54; (37) On the second day, Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Bhīṣma since Droṇa and others, protected by Bhīṣma, would kill Pāñcālas 6. 48. 15 (13); Pāñcālas cheered loudly when Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off a fierce and shining arrow discharged at him by Droṇa 6. 49. 13; Bhīma was honoured by Pāñcālas when he killed Kaliṅga warriors 6. 50. 110 (108); (38) On the third day, Pāñcālas stood in the middle of the Ardhacandravyūha of the Pāṇḍavas 6. 52. 14, 10; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how the Pāñcālas fared against Bhīṣma 6. 55. 2; seeing the river of blood made to flow by Arjuna's sharp arrows, Pāñcālas delightfully raised a loud roar 6. 55. 126, (121125); (39) On the fourth day, the chief warriors of Pāñcālas stood at the same place of the same <i>vyūha</i> as they did on the previous day 6. 56. 11; when Bhīṣma and others marched to help Bhagadatta, Pāñcālas and others chased them; since Bhīṣma did not like to continue fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and others he thought of declaring the end of the war for that day 6. 60. 64, 68; (40) On the fifth day, although Pāñcālas were getting killed by Bhīṣma, they rushed at him with spirited mind (<i>āryāṃ yuddhe matiṃ kṛtvā</i>) 6. 68. 31; (41) On the sixth day, Bhīṣma put to death the armies of Pāñcālas with arrows the joints of which were smooth 6. 75. 57; (42) On the seventh day, Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas (<i>vyadha-</i> <i>mat</i>) 6. 82. 38; (43) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma felled down great Pāñcāla archers, but not afraid of death (<i>tyaktvā mṛtyukṛtaṃ</i> <i>bhayam</i>), they attacked Bhīṣma; he cut off their hands and heads and broke their chariots; those who fought from horsebacks also lost their heads 6. 84. 3-6; Bhīṣma strove to kill Pāñcālas while Arjuna fought with their adversaries to protect them 6. 89. 9; when Bhagadatta wanted to reach Yudhiṣṭhira, he had to fight a fierce battle with Pāñcālas who were prepared to fight with weapons (<i>udyatā-</i> <i>yudhaiḥ</i>) 6. 91. 80; on the night of that day, Duryodhana reminded Bhīṣma of his vow to kill Pāñcālas 6. 93. 37; Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that he would kill all Pāñcālas who were taking part in the war or would get himself killed by them 6. 94. 14-15; (44) On the ninth day, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana that if they protected Bhīṣma, he would kill Pāñcālas who had made a common cause with Pāṇḍavas (<i>yattān pāñcālān pāṇḍavaiḥ</i> <i>saha</i>) 6. 101. 4; (45) On the tenth day, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, protected by Pāñcālas, stood behind Sātyaki and Cekitāna in the Sarvaśatrunibarhaṇavyūha of Pāṇḍavas; Bhīṣma rushed towards them 6. 104. 4, 6, 29; Pāñcālas tried to check Bhīṣma who was killing his opponents 6. 105. 8; Bhīṣma dried up the lustre of the eminent and very strong Pāñcāla princes (<i>pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>ca ye śreṣṭhā rājaputrā mahābalāḥ / teṣāṃ</i> <i>ādatta tejāṃsi</i>) 6. 105. 31; Bhīṣma suggested to Yudhiṣṭhira, who was close to him, that if he desired Bhīṣma to be killed, Arjuna, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas should jointly lead the attack on him; accordingly Arjuna, along with Pāñcālas and Cedis, and led by Śikhaṇḍin, marched towards Bhīṣma 6. 111. 15, 26; Bhīṣma in his battle with Matsyas and Pāñcālas, alone, killed innumerable elephants and horses, seven great chariot-fighters, and in addition five thousand chariot-fighters and fourteen thousand footsoldiers 6. 113. 21-22; when Bhīṣma killed seven great chariot-fighters, there arose a great roar (<i>kilakilāśabdaḥ</i>) among Pāñcālas and others who, riding horses, chariots, elephants, and also those who fought on foot attacked Bhīṣma 6. 113. 46-48; when Bhīṣma fell, Pāñcālas blew conches 6. 114. 107; at his fall in the evening of the tenth day (<i>sāyāhne</i>) Pāñcālas were delighted 6. 115. 7; (46) In the summary narration of the events which occurred while Droṇa was the general of the Kaurava army, it is mentioned that the large army of Pāñcālas was scattered by Droṇa when he agitated it and penetrated it (<i>saṃkṣobhyamāṇā</i> <i>droṇena bhidyamānā mahācamūḥ</i>); they, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, trembled (<i>samakam-</i> <i>panta</i>) while they got killed by Droṇa 7. 6. 34, 36; whenever Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa he killed them along with their horses and broke their chariots; ultimately Pāñcālas killed Droṇa by doing evil and cruel deeds (<i>pāñcālair aśivaiḥ krūrakarma-</i> <i>bhiḥ / hato rukmaratho rājan kṛtvā karma</i> <i>suduṣkaram //</i>) 7. 7. 20-21, 32; (47) On the eleventh day, Pāñcālas attacked the warriors led by Aśvatthāman who attacked Draupadī's sons 7. 15. 11; at the end of that day, they praised Arjuna when he declared the end of the war for the day 7. 15. 50; (48) On the twelfth day, Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa; he scattered them away and repeatedly defeated them 7. 20. 18-19, 23; when a Pāñcāla prince (<i>pāñcā-</i> <i>lya,</i> not named) was killed by Droṇa, Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill Droṇa’; in the fierce battle, Droṇa threw the excessively angered Pāñcālas (<i>bhṛśasaṃkruddhān</i>) into disorder 7. 20. 46, 48-49; Pāñcālas, getting killed by Droṇa, trembled (<i>samakampanta</i>) 7. 20. 53; they were broken (<i>bhagna</i>) by Droṇa 7. 21. 1; pierced by Droṇa's arrows, they were thrown back from their positions (<i>calitān</i>); Duryodhana pointed out to Karṇa Droṇa's feat and described the plight of Pāñcālas 7. 21. 7, 11-14; Pāñcālas gathered around Bhīma 7. 21. 23; of the twelve thousand great warriors of Pāñcālas six thousand followed Śikhaṇḍin 7. 22. 14; the remaining six thousand Prabhadrakas (Pāñcālas), riding chariots, with raised weapons and stretched bows, and making death as their common goal (<i>samānamṛtyavo bhūtvā</i>) followed Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 22. 36-37; Bhagadatta was encircled by Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālas; Bhagadatta, riding his elephant, scattered them away; he forced them to run away 7. 25. 24, 26, 41; Pāñcālas, shouting ‘(attack) Droṇa’ (<i>droṇam droṇam iti … pāñcālāḥ samaco-</i> <i>dayan</i>) incited one other; wherever Droṇa attacked the group of Pāñcāla chariotfighters, Dhṛṣṭadyumna went to their help 7. 30. 6, 8; although afflicted by Droṇa's arrows (<i>śarārtāḥ</i>), Pāñcālas did not give up fighting with him; Droṇa killed many of them 7. 31. 38-39; (49) On the thirteenth day, Pāñcālas, checked by Droṇa's arrows could not approach him who was protecting Kaurava army; that was a wonderful feat (<i>tad adbhutam apaśyāma … /yad enaṃ</i> <i>nābhyavartanta pāñcālāḥ … </i>) 7. 34. 10; Bhīma assured Abhimanyu that he, Pāñcālas and others would follow him when he entered the Cakravyūha 7. 34. 22; Duḥśāsana told Duryodhana that he would kill Abhimanyu in the presence of Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 7. 38. 22; when Duḥśāsana swooned in his encounter with Abhimanyu, Pāñcālas raised a loud roar; led by Yudhiṣṭhira they then attacked Droṇa's army 7. 39. 17-18; Pāñcālas and others attacked Jayadratha who foiled their attempt to follow Abhimanyu 7. 42. 18; Arjuna would have himself protected Abhimanyu if he had known that Pāñcālas could not do that 7. 50. 74; Subhadrā wondered who could kill Abhimanyu as though he was helpless when heroic Pāñcālas were there to help him 7. 55. 9; she felt contempt for the strength of Pāñcālas (<i>pāñcālānāṃ ca</i> <i>dhig balam</i>) 7. 55. 12; (50) Saṃjaya told the grieving Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas would (at the end of the war) realize that the calamity was due to his failure to adopt the right course (<i>tat te buddhi-</i> <i>vyabhīcāram upalapsyanti … /pāñcālā … </i>) 7. 62. 7; (51) On the fourteenth day, Pāñcālas fought a fierce battle with Kurus in front of the <i>vyūha</i> of Droṇa; Droṇa and many other kings on the side of Kauravas checked the onward march of Pāñcālas; when Kaurava army was being killed by Pāṇḍavas, Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas with arrows 7. 70. 3, 13-14, 27; Pāñcāla chariot-fighters saved Dhṛṣṭadyumna from the attack of Droṇa 7. 72. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya what did the Pāñcālas do when in their attempt to get close to Arjuna, they were checked by Droṇa (<i>bhāradvājena</i> <i>saṃvṛtāḥ</i>); Saṃjaya told him that in the afternoon of that day Kurus and Pāñcālas fought each other with Droṇa as the bet (<i>aparāhṇe mahārāja saṃgrā-</i> <i>me … /pāñcālānāṃ kurūṇāṃ ca droṇe</i> <i>dyūtam avartata //</i>); Pāñcālas, wanting to kill Droṇa showered arrows on him; in the fierce battle, Pāñcālas, wanting to break the army, used important missiles (<i>tadanīkaṃ bibhitsanto mahāstrāṇi vyadar-</i> <i>śayan</i>) 7. 81. 1-5; demon Alambusa made a river of blood flow carrying away (dead) Pāñcālas 7. 83. 30; Droṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors, known as great chariot-fighters and honoured by Dhṛṣṭadyumna (<i>mahārathasamākhyātā dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumnasya saṃmatāḥ</i>); he killed choice Pāñcāla warriors (<i>pāñcālānāṃ … varān</i> <i>varān</i>) 7. 85. 28-29; when Droṇa defeated hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas and killed many of them there went up a cry (of grief) (<i>teṣām samabhavac chabdo vadhya-</i> <i>tāṃ droṇasāyakaiḥ</i>) 7. 85. 31-32; gods, Gandharvas and others who were watching the battle pointed out to one another the running away Pāñcālas 7. 85. 33; in the absence of Sātyaki, Yudhiṣṭhira was to be protected by Pāñcālas and others 7. 86. 45; Pāñcālas, when they faced Kṛtavarman, were attacked by him; hence they lost enthusiasm (<i>vigatotsāhāḥ</i>); but soon, like noble men, were ready to fight again desirous of attaining great fame (<i>atiṣṭhann ārya-</i> <i>vad vīrāḥ prārthayanto mahad yaśaḥ</i>) 7. 88. 57-59 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 113. 67: <i>āryavat</i> <i>kulīnavat kulīnatvād iti yāvat</i>); when defeated by Kṛtavarman they fled hither and thither 7. 90. 47-48; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wanted to know how Pāñcālas fought with Droṇa; both were deeply inimical to each other and Pāñcālas desired victory for Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 89. 41; Droṇa, having seen that his <i>vyūha</i> was put into disorder by Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas, endeavoured to put it into order; he succeeded in pushing back Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 7. 93. 35; brave Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas rushed from all sides on Droṇa to kill him 7. 97. 51; Duḥśāsana had formed great enmity with Pāñcālas 7. 98. 4; Droṇa hastened moderately towards Pāñcālas (<i>javam āsthāya madhya-</i> <i>mam</i>) and put them to flight; announcing his name while fighting (<i>nāma viśrāvya</i> <i>saṃyuge</i>) he killed many of them 7. 98. 2426; Pāñcālas covered Droṇa from all sides when he was checked by Vīraketu; they showered Droṇa with fiery arrows, costly Tomaras (<i>tomaraiś ca mahādhanaiḥ</i>) and various other weapons; Droṇa broke their arrows 7. 98. 30-32; Pāñcālas shouted that Droṇa would surrender to their king (<i>vaśam</i> <i>eṣyati no rājñaḥ</i>) 7. 98. 55; when the horses of Dhṛṣṭadyumna's chariot ran in all directions, Droṇa forced Pāñcālas to run away; defeating them Droṇa put his <i>vyūha</i> in order (<i>svaṃ vyūhaṃ punar āsthāya</i>) 7. 98. 57-58; when Duryodhana challenged Yudhiṣṭhira, Pāñcālas rushed towards him; Droṇa checked their advance 7. 100. 36-38; Dhṛṣṭaketu wanted to attack Droṇa who was killing Pāñcāla army 7. 101. 23; Pāñcālas trembled (<i>samakam-</i> <i>panta</i>) as they were getting killed by Droṇa 7. 101. 47, 53; the great fighters of Pāñcālas were as though held at their thighs by Droṇa (<i>ūrugrāhagṛhītā hi pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>mahārathāḥ</i>) 7. 101. 49 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 125. 52: <i>ūrugrāhaḥ ūrustambhaḥ</i>); when Cekitāna's charioteer was killed, Pāñcālas were afraid; Droṇa made them run away 7. 101. 67-68; when Pāñcāla army was reduced in number by Droṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira did not know who could go to save them 7. 102. 3-4; when the <i>vyūhas</i> of Pāṇḍavas were put into disorder, Pāñcālas and Pārthas went back a long way (<i>vyūheṣv</i> <i>āloḍyamāneṣu pāṇḍavānāṃ tatas tataḥ /</i> <i>sudūram anvayuḥ pārthāḥ pāñcālāḥ saha</i> <i>somakaiḥ //</i>) 7. 102. 1; when Bhīma started to help Arjuna, Pāñcālas followed him 7. 102. 67: Droṇa wanted to remain at his place to check the advancing Pāñcālas 7. 105. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra told Saṃjaya that if ever Pāñcālas were to fight with Bhīma they would not be able to protect their lives (<i>na bhīmamukhasaṃprāpto mucyeteti</i> <i>matir mama / … na pāñcālā … jānanti</i> <i>yudhi saṃrabdhā jīvitaṃ parirakṣitum</i>) 7. 110. 22-23; Duryodhana pointed out to Droṇa, Śikhaṇḍin who led the Pāñcāla army 7. 125. 11; he told Droṇa that either he would kill Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas or else get killed by them 7. 125. 25; Droṇa felt himself sinking in the sin of Dhṛṣṭadyumna since he had not yet killed him, Śikhaṇḍin and Pāñcālas (<i>majjantam</i> <i>iva cātmānaṃ dhṛṣṭadyumnasya kilbiṣe</i>); he could not take off his armour until he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 126. 25, 32; (52) In the fierce battle that was fought during the night between fourteenth and fifteenth day the reporters on the battlefield like Saṃjaya could distinguish the Pāñcālas from Kurus only by hearing their personal names and the names of their respective <i>gotras</i> and families (<i>gotrānāṃ nāmadheyānāṃ</i> <i>kulānāṃ caiva tuāriṣa / śravaṇād dhi</i> <i>vijānīmaḥ pāñcālān kurubhiḥ saha //</i>); Pāñcālas fled in all directions when they were being killed by Duryodhana 7. 128. 2, 8, 17; at that time Pāñcālas led by Bhīma attacked Duryodhana; when deeply wounded, Duryodhana sat down in his chariot, Pāñcālas felt he was dead and delightfully they raised a loud cry 7. 128. 21, 23; when Duryodhana attacked Yudhiṣṭhira, Pāñcālas advanced towards him; Droṇa faced them 7. 128. 33; Drupada, protected by Pāñcālas turned towards Droṇa; six thousand Pāñcālas, led by Śikhaṇḍin, rushed towards Droṇa 7. 129. 8, 10; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya when Droṇa, after the death of Jayadratha and Bhūriśravas, attacked Pāñcālas, what did Arjuna do ? when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army, how was he (later) killed ? 7. 130. 3, 7; when Droṇa used Vāyavyāstra, Pāñcālas ran away due to fear; but when Bhīma and Arjuna invaded the Kaurava army, Pāñcālas followed them 7. 132. 38, 41; Karṇa asked Duryodhana to save the Kaurava warriors attacked on all sides by Pāñcālas and others; Pāñcāla chariotfighters, feeling victorious and delighted, were making loud sound; he assured Duryodhana that he would kill Pāñcālas who had come forward to fight 7. 133. 3, 4, 6, 11; the victorious Pāñcālas raised a cry seeing Karṇa engaged in battle with Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana asked his army to stand still for he was going to kill the attacking Pāñcālas; he also requested Aśvatthāman to kill Pāñcālas since they, feeling victorious, moved in the Kaurava army like forest-fire; Aśvatthāman was born for killing Pāñcālas and make the world devoid of them; that was declared by the Siddhas, and it was bound to be true (<i>kariṣyasi</i> <i>jagat sarvam apāñcālaṃ kilācyuta / evaṃ</i> <i>siddhābruvan vāco bhaviṣyati ca tat</i> <i>tathā / </i>); Pāñcālas would not be able to withstand the <i>astras</i> of Aśvatthāman 7. 134. 11, 54, 76-77, 79-81; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that he would fight with Pāñcālas for Duryodhana's delight; they would run away in all directions when burnt down by his arrows; when Yudhiṣṭhira would see Pāñcālas dead, he would be dejected; Aśvatthāman then challenged Pāñcālas to steady themselves and fight with him; he asked their great chariot-fighters to strike him showing their skill in the use of <i>astras (praharadhvam itaḥ sarve mama</i> <i>gātre mahārathāḥ / sthirībhūtāś ca yudhya-</i> <i>dhvaṃ darśayanto 'stralāghavam //);</i> when addressed, Pāñcālas showered weapons (arrows ?) on Aśvatthāman (<i>śastravṛṣṭim</i> <i>apātayan</i>); Aśvatthāman repulsed the arrows and killed ten heroes in the presence of Pāṇḍavas and Dhṛṣtadyumna; when Pāñcālas were getting killed, they ran away in all directions; seeing that, Dhṛṣṭadyumna rushed at Aśvatthāman; in the duel that ensued, Dhṛṣṭadyumna was covered on all sides by the entire Pāñcāla army; Aśvatthāman, by his well-joined arrows, forced hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas to flee (<i>bāṇaiḥ saṃnataparva-</i> <i>bhiḥ</i>); he killed a hundred Pāñcālas with a hundred arrows (<i>śatena ca śataṃ hatvā</i>), and three great chariot-fighters with three sharp arrows (<i>tribhiś ca niśitair bāṇair</i> <i>hatvā trīn vai mahārathān</i>); he thus killed a large number of those Pāñcālas who were prepared for fight (<i>nāśayām āsa</i> <i>pāñcālān bhūyiṣṭhaṃ ye vyavasthitāḥ</i>); Pāñcālas, thus getting killed, left Aśvatthāman and went away with their chariots and banners shattered; Aśvatthāman having defeated his enemies, uttered a loud roar 7. 135. 10, 11, 13; 16-21; 36, 47, 49-52; Droṇa used <i>vāyavyāstra</i> against Pāñcālas; getting killed, they ran away; when Bhīma and Arjuna attacked the left and the right flank respectively (<i>bībhatsur dakṣiṇaṃ</i> <i>pārśvam uttaraṃ tu vṛkodaraḥ</i>), great chariot-fighters among Pāñcālas followed them; Droṇa blew away (<i>vyadhamat</i>) the Pāṇḍava army and Pāñcālas at the start of the night (<i>rajanīmukhe</i>) 7. 136. 11, 14; 7. 137. 51; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya, when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army and burnt their hosts of chariots who protected him on all the four sides 7. 139. 12-14; when Pāñcālas and Kauravas killed one another they raised a fierce sound (<i>āsīn</i> <i>niṣṭānako ghoro nighnatām itaretaram</i>) 7. 139. 32; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Pāñcālas and others to attack Droṇa to kill him; then, raising fearful cries they attacked him 7. 140. 2-3; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas raised a loud roar 7. 141. 32; when Duryodhana, while fighting with Bhīma, lost his charioteer and horses, he was considered dead; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa 7. 141. 60; after defeating Sahadeva, Karṇa turned towards Pāñcālas 7. 142. 16; when Śikhaṇḍin was defeated by Kṛpa.

incited by Duryodhana, Droṇa fought fiercely and started killing Pāñcālas; then they raised a tumultuous cry; when they were broken and shattered, dejected Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna their plight 7. 147. 15, 22-23; he advised Arjuna to assist their great chariot-fighters, as well as Bhīma, to give encouragement to the entire army (<i>āśvāsanārthaṃ sarveṣāṃ sainyānām</i>) 7. 147. 29; Karṇa oppressed the great chariotfighters among Pāñcālas (<i>pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>mahārathān / abhyapīḍayat</i>); pressed hard by Karṇa, the large Pāñcāla army ran away (<i>sā pīḍyamānā tu karṇena pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>mahācamūḥ / saṃprādravat susaṃtrastā</i>); their warriors fell down from horses, elephants and chariots; Karṇa cut off their hands, heads and thighs; Droṇa assisted him 7. 148. 9-19; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Ghaṭotkaca their plight 7. 148. 45; Pāñcālas, smiling, watched the battle between Karṇa and Ghaṭotkaca 7. 152. 5;

Dhṛtarāṣṭra was curious to know how the Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas who, armed and in battle-arrays (<i>vyūḍhānīkāḥ</i> <i>prahāriṇaḥ</i>) fought with Droṇa when they attacked him (7. 158. 13); when, Yudhiṣṭhira after the death of Ghaṭotkaca started to fight with Kauravas, Pāñcālas armed for battle (<i>daṃśitāḥ</i>) beat <i>bheris</i> and blew conches 7. 158. 50; Droṇa vowed that he would take off his armour only after he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 160. 12; towards the end of the night war, Droṇa divided his army into two parts and, led by Duryodhana, attacked Pāñcālas; they were specifically afflicted by the arrows of Droṇa; yet, although suffering from excessive pain, Pāñcālas continued to fight (<i>pāñcālās tu viśeṣeṇa droṇasāyaka-</i> <i>pīḍitāḥ / samasajjanta rājendra samare</i> <i>bhṛśavedanāḥ</i>) 7. 161. 3, 28; when Droṇa killed Virāṭa, Drupada, and other warriors of Pāñcālas, Dhṛṣṭadyumna cursed the Pāñcāla warriors who would let Droṇa remain alive or turn away from him; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa, but they could not even look at Droṇa although they tried, protected as he was by Duryodhana and others (<i>yatamānāpi pāñcālā</i> <i>na śekuḥ parivīkṣitum</i>) 7. 161. 35-37, 38, 40; (53) On the fifteenth day, when the large armies of Kauravas and Pāñcālas clashed with one another, everything was in turmoil and nothing was quite clear (<i>āvignam abhavat sarvam … na</i> <i>prājñāyata kiṃcana</i>); in the raised dust it was difficult to know who were Kauraveyas and who Pāñcālas 7. 162. 22, 27-28; during the duel between Karṇa and Bhīma, Yudhiṣṭhira addressed the chief heroes of Pāñcālas and urged them to go and help the chief warriors of Pāṇḍavas (<i>pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>naravyāghrān … tatra gacchata yatraite</i> <i>yudhyante māmakā rathāḥ</i>); Pāñcālas, thus urged, divided their army into four parts (<i>caturdhā vāhinīṃ kṛtvā</i>): a part hit Droṇa with arrows; others, led by Bhīma, covered him from another side (<i>pāñcā-</i> <i>lās tv ekato droṇam abhyaghnan bahubhiḥ</i> <i>śaraiḥ / bhīmasenapurogāś ca ekataḥ parya-</i> <i>vārayan // </i>); Arjuna was urged to separate Kurus from Droṇa; then Pāñcālas would kill Droṇa whose protectors were slain; but Droṇa attacked Pāñcālas and killed them; however, they continued to attack Droṇa; as they were getting killed a fearful sound was raised by them; when Pāñcālas were thus getting killed, Pāṇḍavas were afraid and they lost hope of victory (<i>vadhya-</i> <i>māneṣu saṃgrāme pāñcāleṣu...pāṇḍavān</i> <i>bhayam āviśat / … nāśaṃsur vijayaṃ tadā //</i>) 7. 164. 48-54, 56-58, 60-63; after the false news of Aśvatthāman's death twenty thousand Pāñcāla principal heroes (<i>nara-</i> <i>rṣabhāḥ</i>) showered arrows from all sides on Droṇa; he then used <i>brahmāstra</i> to kill Pāñcālas; with that missile he cut off their heads and large arms adorned with gold ornaments (<i>tathaiva parighākārān bāhūn</i> <i>kanakabhūṣaṇān</i>) and killed twenty thousand Pāñcāla chariot-fighters (<i>viṃśati-</i> <i>sāhasrān pāñcālānāṃ rathavrajān</i>) 7. 164. 78-83; that day Kauravas, led by Droṇa, had started fighting only with Pāñcālas (<i>pāñcālair eva kevalaiḥ</i>), and when Droṇa released the <i>brahmāstra,</i> especially Pāñcālas were killed (<i>pāñcālāś ca viśeṣataḥ / … vyana-</i> <i>śan</i>); when their armies were thus thrashed, Pāñcālas, (though) angered, turned away from battle (<i>amarṣavaśam āpannāḥ pāñcālā</i> <i>vimukhābhavan</i>) 7. 165. 98, 100-101, 104; Droṇa killed hosts of chariot-fighters of Pāñcālas but was killed 8. 4. 5; (54) After the death of Droṇa, Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that he would try to kill Pāñcālas by all sorts of means, whether soft or harsh (<i>sarvopāyāir … karmaṇā</i> <i>yena teneha mṛdunā dāruṇena vā</i>); only after killing Pāñcālas he would have peace of mind; he would force Pāñcālas to run away by the use of Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 166. 28-29, 52; Sahadeva, in order to pacify Sātyaki, told him that the Pāṇḍavas had no allies other than Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Pāñcālas; similarly the Pāñcālas had no allies other than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 48, 50; when, after the death of Droṇa, Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Pāñcālas became ready to fight, Aśvatthāman aimed his Nārāyaṇāstra against the Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas; Yudhiṣṭhira, afraid of the effects produced by the <i>astra,</i> asked Dhṛṣṭadyumna to run away with Pāñcāla army; he also remembered that Pāñcālas. led by Satyajit and making effort for his victory, were totally destroyed by Droṇa (<i>pāñcālāḥ</i> <i>satyajinmukhāḥ / kurvāṇā majjaye yatnaṃ</i> <i>samūlā vinipātitāḥ</i>) 7. 170. 10, 15, 26, 34; Duryodhana urged Aśvatthāman to use Nārāyaṇāstra again when Pāficālas, wishing victory, had steadied themselves (<i>vyavasthitā</i> <i>hi pāñcālāḥ punar eva jayaiṣiṇaḥ</i>); Aśvatthāman told him his inability to do that but he forced Pāñcālas to run away wounding them with arrows; when Aśvatthāman succeeded in killing many prominent (Pāñcāla) heroes on the side of Pāṇḍavas he blew his large conch with delight; hearing that all Pāñcālas, and even Bhīma, ran in all directions leaving Dhṛṣṭadyumna behind 7. 171. 25, 45, 67; (55) Saṃjaya, summarizing the events between the death of Droṇa and that of Karṇa, told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Duryodhana assured his army that they would be witnesses to the heroism of Karṇa and Aśvatthāman against the Pāñcālas; Karṇa killed and afflicted many Pāñcālas, but was ultimately killed by Arjuna 8. 2. 15, 18, 20; 8. 5. 30; Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had once before defeated Pāñcālas and made them pay tribute (<i>ajaiṣīt … pāñcālāṃś ca … cakre</i> <i>balibhṛtaḥ purā</i>) 8. 5. 18-20 (reference to Karṇa's conquests before the Vaiṣṇava sacrifice of Duryodhana 3. 241. 29, 32; 3. App. I. 24. 28-34); (56) On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana requested Karṇa to lead the Kaurava army because when Pāñcālas would see him they would run away; Pāṇḍavas together with Pāñcālas would be disheartened on seeing Karṇa ready to fight (<i>pāṇḍavā gatacetasaḥ … pāñcālaiḥ</i> <i>saha</i>); the bards urged Karṇa to kill Pāñcālas and bring victory to Kauravas; they also said that Pāñcālas would not be able to withstand Karṇa ready with his arms 8. 6. 30-31, 40, 42; Pāñcālas and others rushed at the Kaurava army; their chariot-fighters, elephant-riders and important foot-soldiers, delighted, danced and laughed making different sounds (<i>nānā-</i> <i>vidharavair hṛṣṭā nṛtyanti ca hasanti ca</i>) 8. 8. 19-20; Karṇa put to death twenty Pāñcāla chariot-fighters along with their horses and charioteers and felled down their banners; he also killed many other Pāñcālas; then Pāñcāla princes (<i>? pāñcāla-</i> <i>putrāś ca</i>) attacked Karṇa 8. 16. 16, 22-23; heroes from the east and south, skilled in elephant-warfare, showered arrows, <i>tomaras</i> and <i>nārācas</i> on Pāñcālas; Pāñcālas, with sharp weapons, surrounded the elephants and showered arrows on them; they covered Nakula to protect him from those who were fighting from elephants; Karṇa, after defeating Nakula, turned towards Pāñcālas; Pāṇḍavas raised a loud cry seeing Karṇa approach Pāñcāla chariot-fighters (<i>dṛṣṭvā senāpatiṃ yāntaṃ</i> <i>pāñcālānāṃ rathavrajān</i> 8. 17. 99); their chariots then were carried away (by horses) with or without the charioteers and their axles broken; those Pāñcāla <i>mahā-</i> <i>rathas</i> who survived began to run away; Karṇa, showering arrows, persecuted Pāñcālas whose armours and banners were broken and tormented them with arrows 8. 17. 7, 21, 98-99, 101, 119-120; Ulūka, after defeating Yuyutsu, turned towards Pāñcālas striking them with arrows 8. 18. 11; when Yudhiṣṭhira fought a duel with Duryodhana, Pāñcālas attacked Kauravas making sounds (<i>kṣveḍāḥ kilakilāśābdāḥ</i>) and striking thousands of <i>tūryas;</i> men fought against men, elephants against elephants, chariots against chariot-fighters and horses against horse-riders; those duels were for a while pleasing to watch (<i>dvandvāny āsan</i> <i>mahārāja prekṣaṇīyāni saṃyuge; muhūr-</i> <i>tam eva tad yuddham āsīn madhuradarśa-</i> <i>nam</i>); all fought the battle according to the rules; nobody struck the opponent from behind (<i>anyonyaṃ samare jaghnur yodha-</i> <i>vratam anuṣṭhitāḥ / na hi te samaraṃ cakruḥ</i> <i>pṛṣthato vai kathaṃcana //</i>) 8. 19. 45-49; but later the battle was fought disregarding the proper norms; the battle described in 8. 19. 49 ff.; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas 8. 19. 74; (57) On the seventeenth day, Duryodhana wanted Karṇa and Śalya together to kill Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; Karṇa asked Śalya to drive his chariot to Pāñcālas and others; either he would kill them or they would kill him; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa that the banners and the chariots of Pāñcālas were making sound (<i>dhvajāḥ kaṇakaṇā-</i> <i>yante … sapatākā rathāś cāpi pāñcālānām</i>) 8. 31. 51; a fierce battle broke out between Pāñcālas and Kauravas; Duryodhana protected Karṇa fighting with Pāñcālas and other heroes; Karṇa rushed towards Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Pāñcālas who rushed at him; Karṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors with equal number of arrows; hosts of Pāñcāla chariot-fighters then surrounded Karṇa; Karṇa killed with five arrows five Pāñcāla prominent warriors viz. Bhānudeva, Citrasena, Senābindu, Tapana and Śūrasena; then there was a loud cry of anger among the Pāñcālas (<i>hāhākāro</i> <i>mahān āsīt pāñcālānāṃ mahāhave</i>); but Pāñcālas, equipped (<i>daṃśitāḥ</i>), attacked Karṇa 8. 32. 15, 20, 25-26, 33, 35-38, 43; they checked the advance of Karṇa; he could not break through their resistance to reach Yudhiṣṭhira; when he reached Yudhiṣṭhira and defeated him the latter turned back and Pāñcālas followed him 8. 33. 7, 9, 15, 41; Pāñcālas and others gathered together and, disregarding the terrible fear of death (<i>tyaktvā mṛtyubhayaṃ ghoram</i>), attacked Aśvatthāman 8. 39. 10; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas by thousands 8. 40. 4-5; when he attacked them, no one of them turned back; they attacked Karṇa from all sides; he moved among them unafraid; he made hosts of their chariot-fighters run away 8. 40. 42, 44, 58-59; Karṇa, singlehanded, announcing his name (<i>viśrāvya</i> <i>nāma</i>) killed many Pāñcālas, respected by brave (<i>śūrasaṃmatāḥ</i>); onlookers like Saṃjaya felt that no Pāñcāla warrior would be allowed to live by Karṇa; Karṇa, while blowing away Pāñcālas (<i>vidhaman</i>), rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira; he, alone, fought with Cedis, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas 8. 40. 62-64, 68; Pāñcālas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed Bhīma and returned to battle (<i>tam ete 'nu nivartante</i>) 8. 41. 3; Karṇa, alone, held back Pāñcālas and others; when Pāñcālas saw that Dhṛṣṭadyumna was saved by Arjuna, they, considering themselves victorious, sounded musical instruments by thousands and made loud roar 8. 42. 32, 54-55; Pāñcālas quickly rallied round Yudhiṣṭhira to help him; in the presence of Pāñcālas and others, Karṇa broke the banner on the chariot of Yudhiṣṭhira; he destroyed the army of Pāṇḍavas (including Pāñcālas); Pāñcālas started to run away; Karṇa had already defeated them; it was felt that Karṇa attacking them would extirpate Pāñcālas (<i>samucchetsyati</i>); but when Bhīma appeared, Pāñcālas started killing Kaurava army 8. 43. 3, 22-29, 31-32, 50, 53; chariotfighters (<i>rathinaḥ</i>) of Kauravas, struck by Pāñcālas, fell down from their chariots; Pāñcālas returned towards the army of Kauravas (<i>dhārtarāṣṭrān</i>) and killed those who, riding elephants, horses and chariots, were fighting; supported by Bhīma, Pāñcālas disregarded their lives and crushed their enemies; while killing their adversaries, they blew conches and shouted; when the Pāñcālas were thus killing the Kaurava army, Kṛpa, Karṇa and other heroes made great attempt to stop their attack 8. 43. 59-65; but Pāñcālas, enraged and feeling victorious, attacked the Kaurava army from all sides 8. 44. 8; Karṇa assured Śalya that he would kill all Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas and then released his Bhārgavāstra against them; Pāñcālas, afflicted by that missile, raised a loud cry (<i>hāhākāro mahān</i> <i>āsīt pāñcālānām … </i>); getting killed by the missile Pāñcālas were all confused (<i>tatra</i> <i>tatra vyamuhyanta</i>) 8. 45. 32, 37, 41; Karṇa cut off the banner of Yudhiṣṭhira and killed his two side-charioteers in the presence of Pāñcālas (<i>hatau ca pārṣṇisārathī</i>) 8. 46. 12; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: all Pāñcālas, under Arjuna's guidance, were ready to fight; protected by him, they had killed enemies; Bhīṣma had earlier killed Pāñcālas; Arjuna now should kill the enemies, viz. the five great warriors Aśvatthāman, Kṛtavarman, Karṇa, Śalya and Kṛpa, so that Pāñcālas might rejoice (<i>adya modantu pāñ-</i> <i>cālā … </i>); Pāñcālas wished to rescue Pāṇḍavas (<i>pāṇḍavān ujjihīrṣavaḥ</i>) but were fleeing as they got killed by Karṇa; they were as good as under the control of Karṇa (<i>viddhi</i> <i>karṇavaśaṃ gatān</i>); Pāñcālas, struck by Karṇa, raised a fierce cry (<i>śrūyate ninado</i> <i>ghoras … </i>); when they faced Bhīṣma, they never turned back (<i>nāsan parāṅmukhāḥ</i>); they would not turn back due to fear of Karṇa; Karṇa was killing the attacking Pāñcālas by hundreds — Pāñcālas who gave lives for their friends; Pāñcālas were fleeing in all directions (<i>ete caranti pāñcālā</i> <i>dikṣu sarvāsu</i>) as they faced the irresistible <i>astra</i> of Karṇa obtained by him from Bhārgava (8. 51. 101); if Karṇa was neglected (<i>upekṣitaḥ karṇo … </i>); he would kill Pāñcālas and the rest 8. 51. 5-6, 12, 27, 54, 91-96, 98-100, 104, 106; Arjuna saw Pāñcāla army running away; he desired to pay back the debt he owed to Pāñcālas by killing Karṇa (<i>pāñcālānāṃ ca mādhava /</i> <i>adyānṛṇyaṃ gamiṣyāmi</i>) 8. 52. 5, 28; as desired by Karṇa, Śalya drove his chariot towards Pāñcālas; entering their army, Śalya stopped Karṇa's chariot wherever he desired; seeing Karṇa's chariot, the Pāñcālas trembled (<i>trastā āsan</i>); when Karṇa killed Pāñcālas a loud cry arose among them (<i>tatrākrando mahān āsīt</i>); although the great Pāñcāla archers were defeated, they returned to fight till death (<i>mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivartanam</i>); Karṇa killed twentyfive chariot-fighters and more than hundred horse-riders; the wonderful heroism of Pāñcālas was witnessed by others when Pāñcālas did not abandon fighting although they were getting killed (<i>tatrādbhutam apaśyāma pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>parākramam / vadhyamānāpi karṇena</i> <i>nājahū raṇamūrdhani //</i>); two sons (not named) of Karṇa killed strong Pāñcālas 8. 56. 8-11, 23, 31, 47, 49, 54, 56; but at one stage Pāñcālas, afraid of Karṇa, began to flee (<i>ete dravanti pāñcālāḥ karṇāt</i> <i>trastā … </i>) 8. 57. 3; Karṇa rushed towards Pāñcālas in spite of Arjuna (<i>paśyataḥ</i> <i>savyasācinaḥ</i>); he killed Pāñcālas by releasing thousands of arrows; there was fierce battle of Karṇa with Pāñcālas who were getting killed while fighting for the sake of their allies (<i>vadhyatāṃ sūtaputreṇa</i> <i>mitrārthe 'mitraghātināṃ</i>) 8. 59. 42, 44-45; Karṇa scattered away Pāñcāla princes (<i>? pāñcālaputrān</i>); Karṇa was making the Pāṇḍava army devoid of Pāñcālas (<i>apāñcā-</i> <i>lyaṃ kriyate</i>); then five senior Pāñcāla chariot-fighters, Uttamaujas and others, attacked Karṇa but were not able to fell down Karṇa from his chariot; all of them were hit by Karṇa with arrows after he cut off their bows and banners and killed their horses and chariots; all of them were defeated by Karṇa; when they were rescued by Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki, the five chariot-fighters got other chariots and, wellarmed, they rallied round Sātyaki to protect him 8. 60. 1, 10, 15-17, 21-22, 26; Karṇa tormented Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas by the lustre of his missiles (<i>pratāpya</i> <i> … astratejasā</i>), but was thoroughly pacified by the lustre of Arjuna (i. e. by his missiles) (<i>saṃśāntaḥ pārthatejasā</i>) 8. 68. 43; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas honoured Arjuna when Karṇa was killed 8. 69. 37; (58) In the evening of the seventeenth day Duryodhana told Śalya that when he would be on the battle-field Pāñcālas would give up all effort (<i>nirudya-</i> <i>māḥ</i>) 9. 5. 24; Śalya, when chosen by Duryodhana to lead his army, assured him that he would kill all Pāñcālas in battle: “let them see in battle my heroism, strength of my arms and bow, my skill and power of my missiles” (<i>vikramaṃ mama paśyantu</i> <i>dhanuṣaś ca mahad balam / lāghavaṃ</i> <i>cāstravīryaṃ ca bhujayoś ca balaṃ yudhi //</i>) 9. 6. 11, 13-14; after listening to Kṛṣṇa's advice, Yudhiṣṭhira permitted all Pāñcālas to leave and he slept that night freed of all care; all Pāñcālas too, delighted at Karṇa's death, slept (happily) that night 9. 6. 38-40; (59) On the eighteenth day, the victorious Pāñcālas went to the battlefield 9. 7. 42; seeing Śalya's heroism, Duryodhana felt Pāñcālas, Sṛṃjayas and Pāṇḍavas as good as dead 9. 12. 28; having heard Yudhiṣṭhira's vow to kill Śalya, all Pāñcālas felt delighted; they blew conches, beat <i>bheris</i> and <i>puṣkaras</i> by hundreds and made loud roar in anticipation of the fulfilment of the vow (<i>tataḥ praharṣaḥ … punar</i> <i>āsīt … pāñcālānāṃ … pratijñām tāṃ ca saṃ-</i> <i>grāme dharmarājasya pūrayan</i>) 9. 15. 2728; Pāñcālas and others, angered by Śalya's killing their army, surrounded him 9. 16. 6; when the Madra army, incited by Duryodhana, entered the Pāṇḍava army, Pāñcālas and others surrounded Yudhiṣṭhira wishing his safety (<i>yudhiṣṭhiraṃ parīpsantaḥ</i>); Madra warriors shouted: “where are the great warriors of Pāñcālas (<i>pāñcālānāṃ</i> <i>mahāvīryāḥ</i>) 9. 17. 8, 13; when the Kaurava army fled after the death of Śalya, Pāñcālas, desirous of victory, persecuted them; seeing the Kaurava army, oppressed by fear, running away, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas spoke to each other about the victory of Yudhiṣṭhira and the defeat of Duryodhana 9. 18. 11, 13-14; seeing Śālva's heroism, Pāñcālas raised cries of despair (<i>hāhākārair nādayantaḥ</i>) and surrounded his elephant 9. 19. 21; hearing the loud roar of delighted Kauravas (<i>siṃhanādaḥ</i> <i>prahṛṣṭānāṃ … </i>), Pāñcālas were dejected; when Kṛtavarman and Sātyaki were engaged in a duel, Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas acted as spectators (<i>prekṣakāḥ samapadyanta</i>); when Kaurava army started running away at the defeat of Kṛtavarman, Duryodhana attacked Pāñcālas and halted them with arrows 9. 20. 6-7, 11, 33-34; Pāṇḍavas, helped by Pāñcālas, stopped the advance of Kurus and killed their seven hundred chariot-fighters; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Sahadeva to kill Śakuni; he himself, along with Pāñcālas, would guard the division of chariots (<i>rathānīkam ahaṃ rakṣye</i>) 9. 22. 14, 34; (60) Aśvatthāman left the army of Pāñcāla king (<i>pāñcālarājasya tad anīkam,</i> i. e. Pāñcālas) and went to Śakuni 9. 24. 42; (61) Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana, who had hid himself in water, that he would that very day kill all Pāñcālas, or else he would not remove his armour; on learning the whereabouts of Duryodhana, when Pāṇḍavas started towards the lake, the delighted Pāñcālas raised a loud roar (<i>kilakilāśabdaḥ prādurāsīd … </i>); those Pāñcālas who survived the war of eighteen days followed Pāṇḍavas to the lake (<i>pāñ-</i> <i>cālānāṃ ca ye śiṣṭāḥ</i>) 9. 29. 21, 46, 52: Duryodhana even in that condition wished to destroy the enthusiasm of Pāñcālas 9. 30. 43; Duryodhana was not afraid of either Pāṇḍavas or Pāñcālas; with mace in his hand he was confident to defeat them in battle; equipped with mace, he appeared to Pāñcālas like Indra with his <i>vajra</i> or Śiva with his <i>śūla;</i> Pāñcālas and other Pāṇḍava warriors clapped each other's palms (<i>anyonyasya talān daduḥ</i>); Duryodhana considered that to be his insult; angered, he said that he would send Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas to the abode of Yama 9. 31. 13, 30, 40-44; Pāñcālas welcomed the decision of Bhīma to fight with Duryodhana and kill him (<i>tad vaco bhīmasena-</i> <i>sya sarva evābhyapūjayan</i>) 9. 32. 27; hearing Duryodhana's challenging words, they also applauded him (<i>saṃpūjayām āsus</i> <i>tad vacaḥ</i>) 9. 32. 50; seeing the bad omens which occurred at the time of the downfall of Duryodhana, Pāñcālas were dejected (<i>āvignamanasaḥ</i>) 9. 57. 57; they were not very happy when Balarāma, displeased with the way Duryodhana was made to lie low, left for Dvārakā (<i>nātipramanaso</i> <i>'bhavan</i>) 9. 59. 27; when Duryodhana fell down, Pāñcālas, delighted (<i>prahṛṣṭa-</i> <i>manasaḥ</i>), threw up their upper garments and made roaring sounds; some expressed their joy by stretching their bows, others by sounding bow-strings; some blew big conches and still others beat <i>dundubhis;</i> some made sportive gestures and laughed (<i>cikrīḍuś ca tathaivānye jaharṣuś ca</i>); they said many things in praise of Bhīmasena 9. 60. 3-16; hearing that, Kṛṣṇa rebuked them 9. 60. 17-18; hearing Kṛṣṇa's words reassuring Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas for the means they adopted to defeat Kauravas, Pāñcālas were very much delighted; they roared like herds of lions (<i>bhṛśasaṃhṛṣṭā</i> <i>vineduḥ siṃhasaṃghavat</i>); Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that he would kill all Pāñcālas with all sorts of means in the very presence of Kṛṣṇa (<i>sarvopāyair hi</i> <i>neṣyāmi pretarājaniveśanam</i>) 9. 64. 35; (a reference to this incident in 1. 2. 180); (62) References to what happened during the night of the eighteenth day are found at the beginning of the Śalyaparvan: (i) Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that during that night the three heroes on the side of Kauravas who survived the war (<i>hataśiṣṭās</i> <i>trayo rathāḥ</i>) killed the entire Pāñcāla army; that was told by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra 9. 1. 13, 30; (ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Duryodhana had assured him that he would kill all Pāñcālas; he then asked Saṃjaya to tell him how all Pāñcālas, together with foot-soldiers, were killed (<i>pāñcālāś ca yathā sarve nihatāḥ sapadā-</i> <i>nugāḥ</i>) 9. 2. 22, 63; (63) In the night of the eighteenth day Aśvatthāman resolved to kill Pāñcālas when they were asleep; he told Kṛpa that Pāñcālas, tired due to exertion, would sleep that night delightfully, trustfully, feeling themselves victorious, unyoking their horses and keeping away their armours; he would storm Pāñcālas in their camp to kill them with his sword and then get peace of mind; he would repay the debt he owed to his father by killing Pāñcālas; by killing the Pāñcāla army at night he will have done his duty and feel happy 10. 1. 53; 10. 3. 25, 28-32, 3435; earlier when Bhīma had stepped on Duryodhana's head, Pāñcālas growled, laughed, blew conches and sounded <i>dundubhis</i> 10. 1. 58-59; Kṛpa told Aśvatthāman that they should kill Pāñcālas next day in battle; Aśvatthāman was quite capable of defeating the Pāñcāla army while fighting with them; they would return from the battle-field only after killing the wretched Pāñcālas or get themselves killed 10. 4. 4, 15, 18; but Aśvatthāman was unable to live even for a while since he had heard Pāñcālas saying: “Droṇa was killed”; they deserved to be killed by him 10. 4. 25-26; Kṛpa tried to dissuade Aśvatthāman by telling him that it would not be proper to kill Pāñcālas when they were trustfully asleep 10. 5. 11; but Aśvatthāman asked Kṛpa why he did not blame Pāñcālas who had committed sin by not following <i>dharma</i> and broken all norms of life (<i>evam adhārmikāḥ pāpāḥ pāñcālā</i> <i>bhinnasetavaḥ</i>); he had therefore decided to kill them during their sleep 10. 5. 2425; Mahādeva told Aśvatthāman that he formerly protected Pāñcālas only out of regard for Kṛṣṇa; but now they were overpowered by Kāla and did not deserve to live (<i>abhibhūtās tu kālena naiṣām adyāsti</i> <i>jīvitam</i>) 10. 7. 63; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman did what was expected of them or whether they were killed by Pāñcālas 10. 8. 4; when Aśvatthāman came out of the camp, Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told him that they had killed Pāñcālas (when they tried to escape) by thousands; Aśvatthāman told them that he had killed the rest of the Pāñcālas in the camp 10. 8. 141, 150; after killing all Pāñcālas, the three of them went to Duryodhana; they told him that all Pāñcālas were killed by them 10. 9. 1, 9, 49; the killing of Pāñcālas referred to earlier by Dhṛtarāṣṭra as a disgusting and disgraceful act of Aśvatthāman and others 1. 1. 153; 1. 2. 181; Kṛṣṇa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira by telling him that Pāñcālas and their companions (<i>pāñcālāś ca sahānugāḥ</i>) were killed by Mahādeva (and not by Aśvatthāman) 10. 18. 26; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was on his way to the battlefield, Aśvatthāman and others told him and Gāndhārī that they had killed Pāñcālas and others 11. 10. 12; (64) When Yudhiṣṭhira started to meet Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāñcāla women present there, followed him (<i>saha pāñcālayoṣidbhir yās</i> <i>tatrāsan samāgatāḥ</i>) 11. 11. 4; (65) When Pāñcāla and Kuru women saw their husbands and relatives lying dead on the battlefield they fell down from their chariots; tired and helpless they were almost deprived of their consciousness (<i>śrāntānāṃ cāpy anāthānāṃ nāsīt kācana</i> <i>cetanā</i>) 11. 16. 13-15; Gāndhārī told Kṛṣṇa that looking at the destruction of Kurus and Pāñcālas, she burnt with grief 11. 16. 25; she asked him how was young Abhimanyu killed by many in the presence of Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 11. 20. 18; (66) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that he was much more grieved to learn the truth about Karṇa's birth than by the death of Pāñcālas and others (<i>tataḥ śataguṇaṃ duḥkham</i>) 11. 27. 18-19; (67) Yudhiṣṭhira, repenting after the war, said that Pāñcālas and Kurus were no doubt killed; but those of them who were not killed would, after death, go to the lowest regions on account of their (i. e. of both Pāñcālas and Kurus) acts 12. 7. 20; Yudhiṣṭhira while taking leave of Kuntī said that Pāñcālas (i. e. their males) were very much depleted, only their daughters remained (<i>pañcālāḥ</i> <i>subhṛśaṃ kṣīṇāḥ kanyāmātrāvaśeṣitāḥ</i>); he did not know who would establish their line again, since most of them were reduced to ashes by Droṇa and those who survived were killed by Aśvatthāman at night 15. 44. 32-33. <b>D.</b> Past event: Formerly, the <i>ṛṣis</i> of the Naimiṣa forest after completing the Viśvajit sacrifice went to the Pāñcāla country (<i>purā … viśvajito</i> <i>'nte vai pāñcālān ṛṣayo 'gaman</i>) 9. 40. 3. <b>E.</b> Various persons styled as ‘one related to Pāñcālas’, ‘king or prince of Pāñcālas’ ‘the prominent warrior among Pāñcālas’, etc.: (a) One related to the Pāñcālas: (i) <i>pāñcāla</i> (fem. <i>-ī</i>): (1) Gālava 12. 330. 3738;
