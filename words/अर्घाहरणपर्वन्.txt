No <i>śūdra</i> was then near the <i>antarvedi</i>, nor anybody without vows (<i>avratin). Nārada</i> sat there with feelings of awe, remembering the words he had heard of old in the mansion of Brahmán regarding the incarnation of the deities, and knowing that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was the incarnation of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> and would himself destroy all these assembled <i>kṣattriyas. Bhīṣma</i> then proposed to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that <i>arghas</i> should be offered to the kings, and first to him who was the foremost. As <i>Bhīṣma</i> declared <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to be foremost, he caused <i>Sahadeva</i> to present the first <i>argha</i> to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, which filled the <i>Cedi</i> king <i>Śiśupāla</i> with envy (II, <b>36</b>). <i>Śiśupāla</i> gravely censures <i>Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (saying that he was a servant and cowherd and no king, and speaking depreciatingly of his exploits), and accompanied by the kings left the assembly (II, <b>37</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> ran after <i>Śiśupāla</i> and spoke sweetly to him in order to conciliate him; <i>Bhīṣma</i> maintained the fitness of giving <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> the first <i>argha</i> (II, <b>38</b>). <i>Sāhadeva</i> and <i>Nārada</i> declared it to be highly improper not to worship <i>Kṛṣṇa. Sunītha</i> (i.e. <i>Śiśupāla</i>) stirred the kings up in order to obstruct the completion of the sacrifice (II, <b>39</b>)."
