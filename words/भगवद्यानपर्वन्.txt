Bhagavadyāna). § 562: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> spoke to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> about the mission of <i>Sañjaya</i> and the wickedness of <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>; though he was supported by the <i>Kāśis</i>, etc. (α), he asked for only five villages (<i>Avisthala</i>, etc., β) or towns, and complained of the cruel duties of the <i>kṣattriya</i> order. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said he was willing to go to the <i>Kuru</i> court in order to negotiate a peace, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, after some hesitation, agreed to the proposal (V, <b>72</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> mentioned the offences of the <i>Kauravas</i>, and said that he thought war to be certain; all the omens pointed in that direction; therefore <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> should collect everything needed for battle (V, <b>73</b>). <i>Bhīma</i> told <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to speak mildly and not threaten the <i>Kurus</i> with war. “Just as, when <i>Dharma</i> became extinct, <i>Kali</i> was born in the race of the <i>Asuras</i>, who flourished with prosperity and blazed with energy, so was <i>Udāvarta</i> born among the <i>Haihayas</i>, etc. (γ). These vile individuals sprang up, at the end of each <i>yuga</i>, in their respective races for the destruction of their kinsmen; so has <i>Duryodhana</i> been born at the end of the <i>yuga</i> among us the <i>Kurus. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> too are averse from war” (V, <b>74</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> scoffed at <i>Bhīma</i> for his unusual mildness, though he had sworn, as the sun journeyed around <i>Meru</i>, to slay <i>Duryodhana</i> with his mace (V, <b>75</b>). <i>Bhīma</i> mentioned his well-known valour, and said that he was for bearing their injuries, only for fear lest the <i>Bharata</i> race might be extirpated (V, <b>76</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> explained that he had only spoken through affection (V, <b>77</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> told <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to strive sincerely to bring about peace; for he was able to do whatever he would; but if <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> deemed the destruction of the <i>Kurus</i> to be preferable, “let it be effected soon”; he mentioned the offences of <i>Duryodhana</i> towards themselves and <i>Draupadī</i>. At all events, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> best knew what was for their good (V, <b>78</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said he would try to bring about what was beneficial to both the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Kurus</i>; to make peace was within his power; he would do all that could be done by human exertion, but he could not control destiny; <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (δ), would never make peace by giving up the kingdom; many a time he had tried to withdraw <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> from <i>Arjuna</i>; about a year ago, on the occasion of attacking <i>Virāṭa's</i> kine, <i>Bhīṣma</i> had solicited <i>Duryodhana</i> about this very peace (V, <b>79</b>). <i>Nakula</i> told <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to act according to his own opinion, disregarding all he had heard. Their attachment for the kingdom was now greater than ever, as nobody could encounter <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ε). He should first speak mildly and then threaten <i>Duryodhana</i>. He did not doubt that he would accomplish his object, for <i>Vidura</i>, etc. (ζ), would understand him (V, <b>80</b>). <i>Sahadeva</i> said that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> ought to provoke a war, because of the insults to <i>Draupadī. Sātyaki</i> approved of this, and thus did all the heroes present (V, <b>81</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> approved of the words of <i>Sahadeva</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i>, mentioned weeping the injustice of the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, and that they had refused to give even five villages, <i>Avisthala</i>, etc. (ζ), and was of opinion that there was no necessity for going thither in order to make peace. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> consoled her: “Thou wilt soon see thy husbands slay their enemies, and crowned by prosperity” (V, <b>82</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> once more besought <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to try to make peace. On the next morning, at the <i>Maitra</i> hour, in the month of <i>Kaumuda</i> (Kārttika), under the constellation <i>Revatī</i>, at the season of dews, Autumn having departed (description), <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> caused <i>Śini's</i> grandson <i>Sātyaki</i> to prepare his chariot (description); they yoked to it <i>Śaibya</i>, <i>Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa</i>, and <i>Balāhaka. Garuḍa</i> came and perched on the flagstaff. And taking <i>Sātyaki</i> also upon it, he set out under auspicious omens; <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, etc. (η), and D.-ṛ. and B.-ṛ. (<i>devabrahmarṣayaś caiva</i>) walked around him (<i>pradakṣiṇam avartanta). Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (θ), followed him on the way, and told him to salute <i>Kuntī</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Arjuna</i> said he was for peace, but if <i>Duryodhana</i> would not give them what they demanded, he would annihilate the <i>Kṣattriya</i> race. <i>Bhīma</i> uttered a terrible shout, so that the bowmen trembled in fear, and steeds and elephants were seen to void urine and fæces. When all the kings had desisted following him, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> set out with <i>Dāruka</i>. On his way he met with some <i>Ṛṣis</i>, and <i>Jamadagni's</i> son, the friend of <i>Brahmán</i> (<i>Surāsurapāteḥ</i>), told him that the D.-ṛ., <i>brahmans</i>, and R.-ṛ., who had witnessed the former feats of gods and <i>Asuras</i> (<i>devāsurasya draṣṭāraḥ purāṇasya</i>), had come to see and hear the assemblage at <i>Hāstinapura</i> (V, <b>83</b>). Ten chariot-warriors followed in <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> train, and 100 foot-soldiers and attendants by hundreds, carrying provisions in abundance. Sinister omens occurred over <i>Hāstinapura</i>; but where <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> passed everything became auspicious. At <i>Vṛkasthala</i> he passed the night (V, <b>84</b>). Meanwhile <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, having heard from his spies that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was coming, respectfully addressed <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (κ), and said to <i>Duryodhana</i> and his counsellors that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (“the lord of all creatures,” etc.) should be received with the greatest honour; “let pavilions be set up on the road,” etc. <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc., approved of it, and <i>Duryodhana</i> made the arrangements. But <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> did not even glance at it (V, <b>85</b>). When <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was staying at <i>Vṛkasthala</i> and intended to come to <i>Hāstinapura</i> the next morning, <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> spoke to <i>Vidura</i> about how he intended to treat <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> in order to honour him (V, <b>86</b>). <i>Vidura</i> blamed <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> for his insincerity; “the right hospitality to be offered to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> is to make peace with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and thou wilt not give them even five villages, and seekest only to separate <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> from the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>” (V, <b>87</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> said that it was of no use to bestow wealth and honour upon <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, as he could never be separated from the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, “and he will only think that we are worshipping him out of fear.” <i>Bhīṣma</i> advised them to do as <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> would say. <i>Duryodhana</i> declared that he would imprison <i>Kṛṣṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and all his counsellors became deeply afflicted, especially as <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came as an ambassador. Inflamed with rage, <i>Bhīṣma</i> rose and left the place (V, <b>88</b>). The next morning <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> rose at daybreak and arrived in <i>Hāstinapura</i>, and was solemnly received by all the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> (except <i>Duryodhana</i>), etc. (λ), and the citizens (description). Having saluted <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. (μ), he went to the abode of <i>Vidura</i> (V, <b>89</b>). In the afternoon he visited <i>Kuntī</i>, who wept for her sons, comparing <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> to <i>Ambarīṣa</i>, etc. (ν), mentioning the feats of <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena</i> (ο), comparing <i>Arjuna</i> to <i>Kārtavīrya</i>, etc. (π), and also inquiring about <i>Sahadeva</i> and <i>Nakula</i>, and likewise about <i>Draupadī</i> (whom she had not seen for fourteen long years), mentioning how she was dragged by <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, while <i>Bāhlika</i>, etc. (ρ), grieved; but especially she praised <i>Vidura</i>. “Full 14 years have gone since <i>Duryodhana</i> first exiled my son.” She mentioned the invisible voice on the night of <i>Arjuna's</i> birth, and trusted to <i>Dharma</i> and the Creator and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. She asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to tell her sons that she besought them to avenge themselves and <i>Draupadī</i>, as even death was better than a life gained by meanness. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> consoled her, and then departed for <i>Duryodhana's</i> mansion (V, <b>90</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> entered <i>Duryodhana's</i> palace (description), where he also beheld <i>Duḥśāsana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Śakuni. Duryodhana</i> asked him to dine at his house; but <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> did not accept the invitation, because he hated the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and went to <i>Vidura's</i> abode, where <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (σ), came to him (V, <b>91</b>). <i>Vidura</i> warned <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> against <i>Duryodhana</i>, who would never make peace, because he trusted <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (τ), and distrusted <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (V, <b>92</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that he knew <i>Duryodhana</i>; but great would be the merit earned by him who liberates the whole earth from the noose of death; and even if he should meet failure, the merit of that intended act would become his; “moreover, I have come here in order that unrighteous, foolish, and inimical persons shall not afterwards be free to say that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> made no attempt to restrain them from slaughtering one another, though he was competent to do so.” Then he laid himself down for sleep (V, <b>93</b>). In the morning <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Śakūni</i> came and invited him to go to the council where <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc., were present; he rode thither in his chariot with <i>Dāruka</i>, putting on his gem <i>Kaustubha</i>, and being protected by the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, and he was followed by <i>Vidura</i> in his own chariot, and by <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Śakuni</i> in one chariot, and by <i>Sātyaki</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i> and the other chariot-warriors of the <i>Vṛṣṇi</i> race in chariots and on steeds and elephants (description). Then he entered the court with <i>Vidura</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i>; before him sat <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i>, behind him the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> with <i>Kṛtavarman. Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, etc., with <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> rose up in his honour, etc. He beheld the <i>Ṛṣis</i> staying in the skies with <i>Nārada</i> at their head, and caused <i>Bhīṣma</i> to offer them seats. <i>Duḥśāsana</i> gave a seat to <i>Sātyaki</i>, and <i>Viviṃśati</i> one to <i>Kṛtavarman</i> (V, <b>94</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> spoke of the just complaints and claims of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and said that with them as his allies <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> would become invincible, having <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ν). “Let not the peoples of the earth be exterminated! If thou regainest thy natural disposition, the earth may continue to be peopled as now.” All the kings there present highly applauded the words of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> in their hearts, but none of them ventured to say anything in the presence of <i>Duryodhana</i> (V, <b>95</b>).—§ 563: <i>Jāmadagnya</i> then told Dambhodbhavopākhyāna (q.v.). “Great, indeed, was that feat of old achieved by <i>Nara. Nārāyaṇa</i> again became superior to <i>Nara</i> in consequence of many additional qualities. Therefore, O king, before such weapons as <i>Kākudika</i>, etc. (ϕ), are placed on the string of the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>, go thou to <i>Dhanañjaya</i>, laying aside thy pride!” These weapons have other names corresponding to the eight passions (lust, wrath, etc.; description) (V, <b>96</b>).—§ 564: Mātalīyopā— khyāna (q.v.).—§ 565: After <i>Kaṇva</i> had spoken, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Nārada</i> in vain admonished <i>Duryodhana. Nārada</i> related the old story Gālavacarita (q.v.), and—§ 566: The fall of <i>Yayāti</i> (q.v.).—§ 567: <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> complained that <i>Duryodhana</i> never listened to his, etc. (α), words, and asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to admonish him. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> reminded <i>Duryodhana</i> of what was agreeable to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. (β), and warned him against <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, etc. (γ). <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (δ), could not fight against <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, who had vanquished D., G., Y., As., and Pn. at <i>Khāṇḍavaprastha</i>; who encountered many at <i>Virāṭa's</i> city, etc. (ε) (V, <b>124</b>). <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Vidura</i>, and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> recommended <i>Duryodhana</i> to follow the counsels of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (V, <b>125</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i> warned <i>Duryodhana</i> against <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (ζ) (V, <b>126</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> complained that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> always censured him; in the match of dice blame could not be attached to him. He quoted this saying of <i>Mātaṅga</i>, “one should always keep himself erect…” (V, <b>127</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> indignantly answered <i>Duryodhana</i>, mentioning his offences against the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Vāraṇāvata</i>, etc. (η). <i>Duḥśāsana</i> said to <i>Duryodhana</i> that the <i>Kauravas</i> would bind him, and <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> would make <i>Duryodhana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Duḥśāsana</i> over to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. Disregarding <i>Vidura</i>, etc. (θ), <i>Duryodhana</i> went out of the court in anger. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> blamed them for not having forcibly seized and bound <i>Duryodhana</i>; “I think the time has come for doing this”; he reminded them of how he had himself slain <i>Kaṃsa</i>, and then installed <i>Ugrasena</i> on the throne, for the benefit of all the <i>Yādavas, Andhakas</i>, and <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>; and that when the gods and <i>Asuras</i>, etc. (ι), were arrayed for battle <i>Parameṣṭhin</i> had commanded <i>Dharma</i> to bind the <i>Daiteyas</i> and the <i>Dānavas</i> and make them over to <i>Varuṇa</i>, who having bound them with <i>Dharma's</i> noose and also with his own, kept them within the depths of the ocean. In the same way they ought to bind <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (κ) (V, <b>128</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> caused <i>Vidura</i> to fetch <i>Gāndhārī</i>, who blamed <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, because he had by his indulgence caused <i>Duryodhana</i> now to be the slave of delusion and incapable of being turned back; she then caused <i>Vidura</i> to fetch <i>Duryodhana</i>, whom she rebuked severely and asked to obey the words of his well-wishers <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. (λ); <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and <i>Bāhlīka</i> [formerly] gave the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> their share from fear of a disunion. If <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (μ), became enraged the population of the earth would be exterminated. The affection of <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Kṛpa</i> towards the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> was equal; “it is never seen in this world that men acquire wealth by avarice” (V, <b>129</b>). Disregarding the words of his mother, <i>Duryodhana</i> again went away in anger, and began to consult with <i>Śakuni</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (ν), resolved upon seizing <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>; then the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with the <i>Somakas</i> would become depressed. <i>Sātyaki</i> knew it, caused <i>Kṛtavarman</i> to array the troops at the entrance of the court, and informed <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and <i>Vidura</i>, but laughed at the project. <i>Vidura</i> told <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> that the last hour of all his sons was at hand. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> that if his sons perpetrated such a deed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> object would be accomplished, “for this very day, seizing them with all who follow them, I can make them over to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; I will not, however, commit any such censurable deed that can proceed only from wrath and a sinful understanding.” <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> once more caused <i>Vidura</i> to fetch <i>Duryodhana</i> with his brothers, etc., and rebuked them; “dost thou not know <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who is incapable of being defeated in battle by D., men, G., As., and U.?” <i>Vidura</i> reminded <i>Duryodhana</i> that at the gates of <i>Saubha</i> the monkey <i>Dvivida</i> covered <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> with a shower of stones, but could not seize him; nor could <i>Naraka</i> with all the <i>Dānavas</i> at <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i>; slaying <i>Naraka</i>, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> brought away 1,000 damsels and married them all. In the city of <i>Nirmocana</i> 6,000 mighty <i>Asuras</i> failed to seize him with their nooses. He also mentioned <i>Pūtanā</i> <i>Śakunī</i>, etc. (ξ) (V, <b>130</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> reminded <i>Duryodhana</i> that he was not alone, and from his body issued myriads of gods, etc. (ο); all the kings were terrified and closed their eyes, except <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Vidura, Sañjaya</i>, and the <i>Ṛṣis</i>; for <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> gave them celestial sight, etc. Then he went out with <i>Sātyaki</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i>. The <i>Ṛṣis Nārada</i>, etc., vanished. He found <i>Dāruka</i> waiting with his chariot (description) drawn by <i>Śaibya</i>, and <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, who had mounted his chariot. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> excused himself, saying that he was powerless. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> bade farewell to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. (π), and set out, followed by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ρ), to the abode of <i>Kuntī</i> (V, <b>131</b>). <i>Kuntī</i> asked him to admonish <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to attend to the duties of his own order, and not contemplate virtue alone (“thy virtue is decreasing greatly”), citing <i>Mucukunda (b</i>). It is the king that creates the <i>Kṛta</i>, <i>Tretā</i>, or <i>Dvāpara</i> age; if he creates the <i>Kṛta</i> age, he enjoys heaven exceedingly; if he creates the <i>Tretā</i>, he enjoys heaven, but not exceedingly; if he causes the <i>Dvāpara</i> age to set in, he enjoys heaven according to his due; if he promotes the <i>Kali</i> age, he will reside in hell for countless years. “That understanding according to which thou art now acting, is not in accordance with the intentions of <i>Pāṇḍu</i>, or myself, or thy grandsire, when we uttered blessings on thee before,” etc. (V, <b>132</b>). “In this connection is cited an old story: § 568. Vidulāputraśāsana” (q.v.).—§ 569: <i>Kuntī</i> asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to remind <i>Arjuna</i> of the voice heard at his birth (that he should rival <i>Indra</i>, vanquish the <i>Kurus</i>, conquer the earth aided by <i>Bhīma</i>; slay the <i>Kurus</i> in battle with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> as his ally, and recover his share in the kingdom, and, with his brothers, perform three great sacrifices); to <i>Bhīma</i> he should say that “the time has come for that in view of which a <i>kṣattriya</i> lady brings forth a son”; <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> he should praise for her behaviour towards the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; he should remind <i>Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i>, that they must not forgive the insults towards <i>Draupadī</i>, that was worse than the defeat at dice and the exile; <i>Arjuna</i> should always tread in the path pointed out by <i>Draupadī; Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> are a pair of <i>Yamas</i> capable of slaying the very gods; they should revenge the harsh words said by <i>Duḥśāsana</i> to <i>Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa</i> bade farewell to <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc., took <i>Karṇa</i> upon his chariot and set out with <i>Sātyaki</i>, deliberating with <i>Karṇa</i> for a long time. Then he dismissed <i>Karṇa</i>, and driven by <i>Dāruka</i> the steeds soon reached <i>Upaplavya</i>. The <i>Kurus</i> assembled and talked about <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (V, <b>137</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i> reminded <i>Duryodhana</i> of what <i>Kuntī</i> had said to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and the exploits of <i>Arjuna</i>; they recommended peace; fearful omens appeared (V, <b>138</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> was cheerless and silent. <i>Bhīṣma</i> complained. <i>Droṇa</i> said that his affection for <i>Arjuna</i> was greater than for <i>Aśvatthāman</i>; <i>Duryodhana</i> ought to have followed the counsels of the elders; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was invincible; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had procured wealth from <i>Kubera's</i> abode; “the periods of our lives have run out”; etc. (V, <b>139</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> related the conversation between <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> (see the note of PCR.). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> disclosed to <i>Karṇa</i> that he was virtually the son of <i>Pāṇḍu</i>, and on the side of his father was related to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, on the side of his mother to the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>. He ought to come with him to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, being the elder brother of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and be installed as king by <i>Dhaumya</i>, etc. (α), <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> being his heir-presumptive and ruling the kingdom under him; “during the sixth period <i>Draupadī</i> also will come to thee”; “let the <i>Draviḍas</i>, etc. (β), walk before thee” (V, <b>140</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> admitted that he was virtually the son of <i>Pāṇḍu</i>, <i>Kuntī</i> having, while a maiden, born him to <i>Sūrya</i> and then abandoned him. But the <i>Sūta Adhiratha</i> had taken him to his home; from her affection for him <i>Rādhā's</i> breasts were filled with milk that very day, and she held his urine and fæces; “how can one like us….deprive her of her <i>piṇḍa?</i>” <i>Adhiratha</i> regarded <i>Karṇa</i> as a son, and <i>Karṇa</i> regarded <i>Adhiratha</i> as a father; he had caused all the rites of infancy to be performed on <i>Karṇa</i> according to the scriptures; he had caused the name <i>Vasuṣeṇa</i> to be bestowed upon him by the <i>brahmans</i>; when <i>Karṇa</i> attained to youth he married wives according to <i>Adhiratha's</i> selection; with them he had begotten sons and grandsons. Through <i>Duryodhana</i> he had enjoyed sovereignty for thirteen years. His many sacrifices had always been with <i>Sūtas</i>, as had also his family rites and marriage rites. It was only after having got hold of <i>Karṇa</i> that <i>Duryodhana</i> had decided upon war with the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Karṇa</i> having been chosen as the antagonist of <i>Arjuna</i>. Their discourse ought to be kept secret, lest <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> should refuse to accept the kingdom; and “if the empire becomes mine I shall certainly make it over to <i>Duryodhana</i> only.” He praised <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (γ), and the weapons of <i>Arjuna</i> (δ), comparing the combat to a sacrifice; and <i>Bhīma's</i> drinking the blood of <i>Duḥśāsana</i> to the <i>Soma</i>-drinking, etc. (V, <b>141</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said the victory of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> was very certain; he described <i>Arjuna's</i> banner, made by <i>Bhaumana</i> by celestial illusion; his <i>Aindra, Āgneya</i>, and <i>Māruta</i> weapons, etc.; “then all signs of the <i>Kṛta, Tretā</i>, and <i>Dvāpara</i> ages will disappear.” He forebade <i>Bhīmasena's</i> dancing, having quaffed the blood of <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, etc. (ε). “Returning hence, say to <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ζ), that the present month is a delightful one; 7 days hence it will be the day of the new moon, presided over by <i>Indra</i>; let the battle commence then” (V, <b>142</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> ascribed the approaching destruction to <i>Śakuni</i>, etc. (η), and mentioned diverse sinister visions of planets (θ), etc., and he had seen in a vision, foreboding victory, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ι), and the inverse respecting <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (κ). “<i>Karṇa</i> embraced <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, descended from his chariot, and riding in his own chariot, which was decked with gold, came back with us” (V, <b>143</b>). <i>Vidura</i> approached <i>Kuntī</i> and spoke of the state and disposition of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (λ), and the allies of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (μ). <i>Kuntī</i> thought with grief on those who were going to fight (ν). Especially she was afraid of <i>Karṇa</i>; she recollected the boon of <i>Durvāsas</i> and its consequences (ξ). She went to <i>Karṇa</i>, who was standing performing his prayers on the bank of <i>Gaṅgā</i> with his face turned towards the east and his arms upraised; and she stayed behind him, waiting for the completion of his prayers. Then, turning round, he beheld <i>Kuntī</i> (V, <b>144</b>). <i>Kuntī</i> disclosed to <i>Karṇa</i> his birth, mentioned the justice of the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> cause and the injustice of <i>Duryodhana's</i>, and besought him to join the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (V, <b>145</b>). <i>Sūrya</i> corroborated the words of <i>Kuntī</i>. But <i>Karṇa</i> represented to her the great injury she had done him; he could not now frustrate the hope of the <i>Kauravas</i>; but “except <i>Arjuna</i> thy other sons shall not be slain by me.” They then left the spot, turning into different directions (V, <b>146</b>). At <i>Upaplavya Kṛṣṇa</i> represented to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> all that had happened at <i>Hāstinapura</i>. In the night, <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> again brought <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> into their midst, and caused him to repeat what had been said by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ο); <i>Bhīṣma</i> had related his own life (π); he mentioned a duel with <i>Rāma [Jāmadagnya]</i>, where <i>Vicitravīrya</i> fled, having been deserted by his subjects; upon <i>Vicitravīrya's</i> death anarchy prevailed in the kingdom, and <i>Indra</i> did not give a drop of rain; afflicted by hunger and maladies (very few of them were still alive), the subjects then asked <i>Bhīṣma</i> —in vain—to ascend the throne; “when <i>Pāṇḍu</i> became king, his sons must obtain their paternal inheritance” (V, <b>147</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> had related the life of <i>Pāṇḍu. Vidura</i> had asked <i>Bhīṣma</i> to go to the woods with him and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, or to bind <i>Duryodhana</i> and rule the kingdom with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. <i>Gāndhārī</i> proved that the kingdom by right belonged to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and their sons and grandsons, and to no others (V, <b>148</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> had repeated to <i>Duryodhana</i> the genealogy of the <i>Kuru</i> race from <i>Soma</i>, mentioning especially that <i>Yayāti (b</i>) had placed his youngest son <i>Pūru</i> on the throne; and that <i>Devāpi's</i> installation was forbidden by the <i>brahmans</i> and all aged persons because of a skin disease (leprosy, Nīl.), and as <i>Bāhlika</i> abandoned his father and brother and obtained the wealthy kingdom of his maternal uncle, <i>Śāntanu</i>, the youngest of the three brothers, became king. “Being defective of a limb, I was likewise excluded by <i>Pāṇḍu</i>; at his death the kingdom must pass to his sons …thou art not the son of a king, and therefore hast no right to the kingdom” (V, <b>149</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> continued his relation; <i>Duryodhana</i> had repeatedly instructed the kings, saying: “To-day is <i>Puṣya</i> [in conjunction with the moon]; march ye.” “Eleven <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> have been assembled headed by <i>Bhīṣma</i> (with the device of the palmyra in his banner)” (V, <b>150</b>)."
