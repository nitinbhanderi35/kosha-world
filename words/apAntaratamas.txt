Because he was absolutely free from inner darkness or ignorance he was called Apāntaratamas. The sage, who was cognizant of the past, the present and the future divided and systematized the Vedas as ordered by Viṣṇu. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) Vyāsa was Apāntaratamas reborn. Mahāviṣṇu ordained that in the Dvāpara age he be born as the son of Parāśara and once again divide and systematize the Vedas, and so was he born as Vyāsa. (Śrī Śaṅkara's Muṇḍakopaniṣad and Brahmasūtra Bhāṣya)."
