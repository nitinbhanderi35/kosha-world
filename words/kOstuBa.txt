It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 3; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa Bālakāṇḍa Sarga 45, Stanza 39 and Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva that this precious stone floated up at the time of the churning of the sea of Milk. This jewel which originated from the ghee in the sea of Milk, was worn on the breast by Viṣṇu. “This divine jewel called Kaustubha came up in the middle of ghee and stayed in the breast of Viṣṇu, spreading its rays everywhere.” (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 18, Stanza 37). <dvsn n='NI'/>KAUTHUMI. Son of a Brahmin named Hiraṇyanābha. Once this Brahmin youth went to the hermitage of King Janaka and entered into a controversy with the Brahmins there. In the argument Kauthumi became angry and killed a Brahmin. From that day he became a leper. The sin of Brahmahatyā (murder of Brahmin) also followed him. Finally according to the advice of his father he worshipped the sun God, with Śrāvyasaṃjñakasūkta (a spell or incantation) and by the blessing of the Sun God he got deliverance from the sin of Brahmahatyā and the disease of leprosy. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brāhma Parva)."
