Jaṭāsuravadha.) § 435: One day, after the <i>Rākṣasas</i> with <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> had departed, while <i>Bhīma</i> was a-hunting, and <i>Lomaśa</i> and the other ṛṣis had gone away to bathe and collect flowers, the <i>Rākṣasa Jaṭāsura</i>, who had followed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in the guise of a brahman versed in all the <i>śāstras</i>, with the object of possessing himself of the arms of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and of <i>Draupadī</i>, began to flee away with the arms and <i>Draupadī</i> and the three <i>Pāṇḍavas. Sahadeva</i> extricated himself, and snatching the sword <i>Kauśika</i>, he began to call <i>Bhīmasena. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> reproached him, saying that the <i>Rākṣasas</i> are the root of virtue and know virtue (<i>dharmaṃ</i>) best, and that the <i>Rākṣasas</i>, gods, <i>Pitṛs</i>, <i>Siddhas, Ṛṣis, Gandharvas</i>, etc., depend for their lives on men, etc. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> then made himself ponderous. <i>Sahadeva</i> was about to attack the <i>Rākṣasa</i>, when <i>Bhīma</i> appeared mace in hand. The <i>Rākṣasa</i> set them down, and he and <i>Bhīma</i> began to fight with trees, like <i>Vālin</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i>, and then with rocks, and at last by wrestling, till <i>Bhīma</i>, having dealt a blow on the neck of the <i>Rākṣasa</i>, lifted him up, and dashed him on the ground and severed his head from his body, and then presented himself before <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (III, <b>157</b>)."
