If the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> should succeed in observing this vow for thirteen years, the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> would in the meantime have made alliances and have assembled an invincible army, so that they could defeat them if they reappeared. <i>Droṇa, Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Gautama, Vidura, Aśvatthāman</i>, <i>Vaiśyāputra</i> (i.e. <i>Yuyutsu</i>), <i>Bhūriśravas, Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Vikarṇa</i> dissuaded in vain (II, <b>74</b>).—§ 303: <i>Gāndhārī</i> reminded <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> of the counsel <i>Vidura</i> had given, when <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> was born, to kill him, and recommended him to do it now, and not to let the gambling match take place, saying that it would cause the destruction of the whole race of the <i>Kurus</i>. But <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> could not act contrary to the will of his sons (II, <b>75</b>).—§ 304: The royal messengers overtook <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> when he had already gone a long way. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> having said, “Although a golden animal was an impossibility, <i>Rāma</i> suffered himself to be tempted by a golden deer,” they returned. The gambling began on the above-mentioned conditions (cf. III, 1362 ff., where the conditions are stated somewhat differently), and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> lost (II, <b>76</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, casting off their royal robes, attired themselves in deer-skins. <i>Duḥśāsana</i> exulted, and exhorted <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> to abandon the fallen <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and choose a husband among the <i>Kurus</i>. As <i>Bhīma</i> rebuked him and threatened to slay him with his followers, <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, dancing around, said, “O cow! O cow!” <i>Bhīṣma</i> again swore to drink his blood and to kill all the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>. As the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were going away, <i>Duryodhana</i> mimicked the tread of <i>Bhīma</i>, who then said: “I will slay <i>Duryodhana</i> with my mace, and place my foot on his head. <i>Dhanañjaya</i> will slay <i>Karṇa</i>, and <i>Sahadeva</i> will slay <i>Śakuni</i>, and I will drink the blood of <i>Duḥśāsana</i>.” <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i> approved of it. <i>Nakula</i>, “the handsomest of men,” vowed to kill all the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> that had insulted <i>Draupadī</i> (II, <b>77</b>).—§ 305: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> bids farewell to <i>Bhīṣma, Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Droṇa, Kṛpa</i>, <i>Aśvatthāman, Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> <i>Yuyutsu, Sañjaya</i>, etc. <i>Vidura</i> kept <i>Pṛthā</i> in his abode, and consoled <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>: “Formerly thou wast instructed on the <i>Himavat</i> by <i>Meru-Sāvarṇi</i>, in <i>Vāraṇāvata</i> by <i>Dvaipāyana</i>, on <i>Bhṛgutuṅga</i> by <i>Rāma</i>, on the <i>Dṛṣadvatī</i> by <i>Śambhu</i>, near <i>Añjana</i> by the great <i>ṛṣi Asita</i>, by <i>Bhṛgu</i> on the banks of <i>Kalmāṣī; Nārada</i> always beholds thee, and this <i>Dhaumya</i> is thy <i>purohita</i>,—resolve to win victory like <i>Indra</i>, to control thy wrath like <i>Yama</i>, to give in charity like <i>Kuvera</i>, to control all passions like <i>Varuṇa</i>.” So <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> went away, bowing to <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, (II, <b>78</b>). When <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> took leave of <i>Kuntī, Kuntī</i> broke out in complaints, and especially recommended her ever to keep her eye on <i>Sahadeva</i>. When <i>Kuntī</i> beheld her sons clad in deer-skins, surrounded by rejoicing foes, she embraced them and broke out in complaints, asking why <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who dwells in <i>Dvārakā</i>, and is without beginning and without end, does not deliver them from such woe. “O <i>Sahadeva!</i> cease to go! thou art my dearest child, O son of <i>Mādrī!</i>” The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, having consoled her, set out for the woods, and <i>Vidura</i> led her to his house. The ladies of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> house wept, blaming the <i>Kauravas</i>; and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, anxious, sent for <i>Vidura</i> (II, <b>79</b>).—§ 306: Questioned by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura</i> described the attitude of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc., when going away (α). The citizens cried out in grief, blaming the <i>Kurus</i>. Flashings of lightning and other terrible omens appeared. <i>Nārada</i> appeared, surrounded by great <i>ṛṣis</i>, and foreboded that on the fourteenth year thence the <i>Kauravas</i> would all be destroyed by <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>. Then he disappeared through the skies. <i>Duryodhana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Śakuni</i> offered the kingdom to <i>Droṇa</i>, who said that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were incapable of being slain; that they would practise the <i>brahmacarya</i> for twelve years, and then return in anger; that he (<i>Droṇa</i>) would protect the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, who had sought his protection, to the best of his ability; but that he would himself be slain by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, whom <i>Drupada</i> had obtained (together with <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>) from the fire by the ascetic power of <i>Yāja</i> and <i>Upayāja</i>; “it is widely known in the world that <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> will slay <i>Droṇa</i>.” <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> sent <i>Vidura</i> to bring the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> back, or, if they did not come back, to send them off with respect, with their weapons, cars, and infantry, etc. (II, <b>80</b>).—§ 307: <i>Sañjaya</i> spoke to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> about the perversity of his policy. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> related that when <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> was dragged into the court the grief was so great that the enraged brahmans did not that evening perform their <i>agnihotra</i>; he also related the omens which had appeared on the occasion, etc. (II, <b>81</b>)."
