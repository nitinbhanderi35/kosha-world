It has to be distinguished from Sarvāṭavi referred to later on in this inscription.<sup>378</sup> According to Krishnaswami Aiyangar,<sup>379</sup> it must have included the Saugar division of C.P. extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda. But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Mahākāntāra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered by Samudragupta. He suggests that Mahākāntāra must be the same as Mahāvana, a forest region extending northwards into Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.<sup>380</sup> This very region has been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna inscriptions.<sup>381</sup>"
