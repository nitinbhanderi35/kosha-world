Mucakunda (<i>rājarṣiḥ</i>) 13. 151. 46; Śveta (<i>rājarṣisat-</i> <i>tamaḥ</i>) 13. 151. 47, Kṣupa (<i>rājarṣiḥ</i>) 13. 151. 48, Nala (<i>rājarṣiḥ</i>) 13. 151. 49, and Kakṣasena (<i>rājarṣiḥ</i>) 13. 151. 50; the list is apparently intended to be recited by one who does not wish to meet with difficulties, nor incur sin, nor encounter enemies, and by one who wishes to have sure victory and great happiness after death (<i>mā vighnaṃ mā</i> <i>ca me pāpaṃ mā ca me paripanthinaḥ /</i> <i>dhruvo jayo me nityaṃ syāt paratra ca parā</i> <i>gatiḥ</i>) 13. 151. 51."
