But, wild animals killed him on their way in the forest. In all repentance Kalipriyā returned home and after worshipping the corpse of her husband she observed Kārttika vrata at the instance of certain women. Thereby she got absolution from sin and attained heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahmakhaṇḍa, Chapter 10)."
