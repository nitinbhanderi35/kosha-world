Mention is made in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa that Avikṣit had seven wives: Varā, Gaurī, Subhadrā, Līlāvatī, Vibhā, Maṅgavatī, and Kumudvatī. Besides them Vaiśālinī the princess of Viśālā also was his wife. He had taken this Vaiśālinī from her Svayaṃvara dais (the bride herself selecting a husband from those who are present), defeating the Kings who were present there. Those defeated Kings, later, joined together and defeated Avikṣit and took him a prisoner. Finally Karandhama rescued him. His greatness is described as follows: <dvsn n='NI'/>“The righteous man Avikṣit is equal to Indra in prowess. This austere and righteous man has become a great sacrificer. In brightness he is equal to the Sun, as forgiving as the earth, in intelligence equal to Bṛhaspati and as firm as the Himālayas. By his thought, word, and deed and self control and noble actions he kept his subjects in peace and prosperity.” (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 4, Stanzas 19-21)."
