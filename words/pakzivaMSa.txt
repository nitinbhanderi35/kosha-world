The latter got of his wife Tāmrā (daughter of Dakṣa) five daughters named Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī. From Krauñcī were born the Ulūkas, Bhāsī gave birth to Bhāsas, Śyenī to vultures and Dhṛtarāṣṭrī to swans and geese. From these originated the entire bird family of the world. (Chapter 4, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa)."
