It has been identified with the village of Goālbhīṭā near Pāhāṛpur.<sup>467</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Vaṭa is perhaps the Prakritic form of vṛtta meaning ‘surrounded, covered’.<sup>468</sup> The village may have been surrounded by a well or fence. On one hand we find another village named as ‘Trivṛtā’,<sup>469</sup> and on the other Vaṭa-nagara appears as the name of a town and Vaṭodaka as the name of a river.<sup>470</sup> <dvsn n='P'/><i>Place-names ending in Pārśvika</i>"
