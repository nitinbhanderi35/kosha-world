She brought forth <i>Yudhiṣṭhira (b</i>). Similarly the birth of <i>Bhīmasena (c</i>) and <i>Arjuna (d</i>) are related in full (cf. § 157)— § 191: Then <i>Kuntī</i> refused to have any more sons (I, <b>123</b>). —§ 192: Birth of <i>Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i> (cf. § 157); celestial voice. The <i>ṛṣis</i> on <i>Śataśṛṅga</i> gave the sons of <i>Pāṇḍu</i> names. They were born at intervals of one year from one another. They became great favourites of the <i>ṛṣis</i> and their wives, dwelling on <i>Śataśrṅga</i> (cf. v. 4864: <i>Haimavate</i> <i>girau</i>). <i>Kuntī</i> refused to help <i>Madrī</i> to get more children, as she had been deceived by her having two sons at once (I, <b>124</b>)."
