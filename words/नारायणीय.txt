            "content": "[<b>Nārāyaṇīya(ṃ)</b>]¦ (“the section treating of Nārāyaṇa”): § 717<i>b</i> (Mokṣadh.). <i>Bhīṣma</i> said: “I heard it from my father that in the <i>Kṛta</i> age, during the epoch of <i>Manu</i> <i>Svāyambhuva</i>, the eternal <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, the Soul of the universe, took birth as the son of <i>Dharma</i> in a quadruple form: as <i>Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari</i>, and the Self-existent (<i>Svayambhuvaḥ!) Kṛṣṇa</i>. Amongst them all, <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> and <i>Nara</i> practised the several austerities, repairing to the <i>Himālayan</i> hermitage <i>Badarī</i> and riding in their golden chariot (description; v. the note of PCR., p. 740). <i>Nārada</i> dropped down on <i>Gandhamādana</i> from a summit of <i>Meru</i> and wandered over all the world, and at last repaired to <i>Badarī</i> at the hour of <i>Nara's</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa's</i> performing their daily rites. He said to himself: this is truly the abode of that Being in whom are established all the worlds including D., As., G., K., and M. -U.; in this spot <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Hari</i> dwelt formerly; what is that deity whom these two worship? who are these <i>Pitṛs</i> whom these two <i>Pitṛs</i> of all beings adore?” Ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>, bowing unto <i>Mahādeva</i>, praised <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (“sung in the <i>Vedas, Purāṇas, Aṅgas</i>, and <i>Upāṅgas</i>”), and asked what god or <i>Pitṛ</i> he was sacrificing to. <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> said that about this topic nothing should be said, as it was an ancient mystery; but because of his devotion he instructed him about <i>Kṣetrajña</i>, etc. The twenty-one <i>Prajāpatis: Brahmán</i>, etc. (α) were first born, and obeyed the eternal law of the Supreme God (XII, <b>335</b>). <i>Nārada (Pārameṣṭhya</i>) proceeded to <i>Śvetadvīpa</i> (“White Island”) to behold <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> in his original shape; by <i>yoga</i> he soared into the firmament, rested for a short while on a summit of <i>Meru</i>, then he directed his eyes towards the north-west, and north of the milky ocean he saw the large island <i>Śvetadvīpa</i>, more than 32,000 <i>yojanas</i> from <i>Meru</i>; the inhabitants of that realm have no senses, etc. (description); they are white and free from every sin, etc. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked for further information about this people. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the story of <i>Uparicara (c</i>), “the essence of all narratives,” which he had heard from his father (XII, <b>336—8</b>). Arrived at <i>Śvetadvīpa, Nārada</i> stood in <i>yoga</i> and hymned <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (ζ) [i.e. <is>Mahāpuruṣastava</is>] (XII, <b>339</b>). <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> showed himself to <i>Nārada</i>, bearing all forms (<i>viśvarūpadhṛk</i>; enumeration), uttering with his mouths <i>Gāyatrī, oṃ</i>, and the <i>Āraṇyaka</i>, and the four Vedas; he mentioned <i>Ekata, Dvita</i>, and <i>Trita</i>, and instructed <i>Nārada</i> (η). <i>Vāsudeva = Soul = Jīva = Śeṣa = Saṅkarṣaṇa</i> (when he takes birth as <i>Jīva</i>) = <i>Kṣetrajña; > Sanatkumāra</i> <i>= Mind = Pradyumna; > the Creator = Aniruddha = Īśāna =</i> <i>Īśvara = Ahaṅkāra</i>. “I am known as <i>Puruṣa</i>; without acts I am the 25th. <i>Hiraṇyagarbha</i>, etc. (θ), are in me.” <i>Nārāyaṇa's</i> boons to <i>Brahmán</i> in days of yore. “I am <i>Kapila</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Brahmán</i> springs from <i>Aniruddha's</i> navel.” The feats that <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> will perform (those that he will slay; his incarnations) (κ); “in the <i>Tretā</i> age I shall take birth as Rāma of <i>Bhṛgu's</i> race…; in the twilight (<i>sandhyāṃśe</i>) between <i>Tretā</i> and <i>Dvāpara</i> I shall take birth as <i>Rāma Dāśarathi</i>; at that time <i>Ekata</i> and <i>Dvita</i> (in consequence of their injury to <i>Trita</i>) will have to take birth as apes; all those apes shall become my allies…; in the period (<i>sandhau</i>) joining the <i>Dvāpara</i> and the <i>Kali</i> I shall take birth in <i>Mathurā</i> in order to slay <i>Kaṃsa</i>, and take up my residence in <i>Kuśasthalī</i> [at] <i>Dvārakā</i>; I shall transplant <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> to <i>Dvārakā</i>, and subjugate <i>Maheśvara</i> and <i>Mahāsena</i> (i.e. Skanda), who will help Dā. <i>Bāṇa</i> (with 1,000 arms);…<i>Brahmán</i> himself never obtained a sight of me in this shape of mine, which thou hast seen to-day.” <i>Hari</i> then disappeared; <i>Nārada</i> returned to <i>Badarī</i>, to behold <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>. This great <i>Upaniṣad</i>, consistent with the four <i>Vedas</i> and with <i>Sāṅkhya-Yoga</i>, and called <i>Pāñcarātra</i>, and recited by <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> himself, was repeated by <i>Nārada</i> in the abode of <i>Brahmán. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked: “Was not <i>Brahmán</i> acquainted with this wonderful narrative of the glory of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> ?” <i>Bhīṣma</i> said that it was only to Ṛ. in the abode of <i>Brahmán</i> that <i>Nārada</i> recited his narrative. The propagation of the narrative; Ṛ. > <i>Sūrya</i> > 66,000 Ṛ. in <i>Sūrya's</i> train, etc., > D. on <i>Meru > Asita ></i> the <i>Pitṛs</i>; “I heard it from my father <i>Śāntanu</i>; it is a <i>Purāṇa</i>, and should not be communicated to anyone that is not a worshipper of <i>Vāsudeva</i>; it is really the essence of the hundreds of other narratives thou hast heard from me; in days of yore, D. and As., uniting together, churned the ocean for the <i>amṛta</i>; after the same manner, the brahmans in days of yore, uniting together, churned all the scriptures and raised this narrative.” He who reads this becomes an inhabitant of <i>Śvetadvīpa</i>, etc.—<i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and all his brothers became devoted to <i>Nārāyaṇa; Vyāsa</i> visited (through the sky) the ocean of milk (which is always the abode of nectar), and worshipping the great God there, he came back to his own hermitage.— <i>Bhīṣma</i> said: “I have now repeated the narrative that was recited to <i>Nārada</i>; that narrative has descended from person to person from very ancient times; I heard it from my father.”—<i>Sūta</i> said: “I have now told you all that <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> recited to <i>Janamejaya</i>. King <i>Janamejaya</i> properly discharged all his duties according to the scriptures. You have all undergone severe penances, etc.; residing in this sacred <i>Naimiṣa</i> forest, ye are…conversant with the <i>Vedas</i>,…ye have come to this sacrifice of <i>Śaunaka</i>; do ye all adore <i>…Nārāyaṇa</i>. I heard this excellent narrative, that has descended from generation to generation, from my father in former times” (XII, <b>340</b>).—<i>Śaunaka</i> asked about <i>pravṛtti</i> and <i>nivṛtti</i>, etc. <i>Sauti</i> recited the discourse of <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> to <i>Janamejaya. Janamejaya</i> said that the whole world with <i>Brahmán</i>, D., As., and men are deeply attached to acts; <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (λ), have adopted the religion of <i>pravṛtti. Vaiśampāyana</i> said that this question related to a deep mystery, and that it required penances and acquaintance with the <i>Purāṇas</i>; he recited what M.-ṛ. <i>Vyāsa</i> said to his disciples <i>Sumantu</i>, etc. (μ) (as he used to teach them the four <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Mahābhārata</i> as the fifth), on <i>Meru</i> (inhabited by Si. and Cā.); <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> had been gratified by his penances on the shore of the ocean of milk, and he had, with the eye of knowledge, beheld all that occurred in the beginning of the <i>Kalpa</i>: <i>Mahā-Puruṣa</i> or <i>Paramātmā</i> (according to both <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and <i>Yoga</i>) <i>> Avyakta (Pradhāna) > Aniruddha (mahān ātmā</i>, <i>Ahāṅkāra) > Pitāmaha</i> (i.e. Brahmán); from <i>Ahaṅkāra</i> have sprung the five elements (<i>mahābhūtāni); Marīci</i>, etc. (ν), are the eight <i>Prakṛtis</i>, upon whom all the worlds depend; <i>Brahmán</i> created them with the <i>Vedas, Vedāṅgas</i>, etc.; <i>Rudra</i> (from the principle of wrath) > ten <i>Rudras</i>: these eleven <i>Rudras = Vikārapuruṣāḥ…Brahmán</i> with the R., <i>Prakṛtis</i>, and D.-ṛ. repaired to the northern shore of the ocean of milk and practised the penances named <i>mahāniyama</i> (declared by <i>Brahmán</i> in the <i>Vedas</i>) for 1,000 celestial years (description); then <i>Hari</i> spoke to them, saying that he would invest them with <i>pravṛtti</i>. They performed a sacrifice in honour of <i>Viṣṇu</i> according to the ordinances laid down for the <i>Kṛta</i> age. The great god was pleased and said that their <i>pravṛtti</i> should be fraught with ends whence there will be return; “<i>Marīci</i>, etc. (ξ), the seven Ṛ. who are <i>mānasāḥ</i> (spiritual sons of <i>Brahmán</i>) will become the preceptors of the <i>Vedas</i>, wedded to the religion of <i>pravṛtti</i>, and created for procreating offspring (<i>Prājāpatye);…Sana</i>, etc. (ο), these seven Ṛ. who are spiritual (<i>mānasāḥ</i>) sons of <i>Brahmán</i>, and whose knowledge comes to them of itself, are wedded to the religion of <i>nivṛtti</i>, conversant with <i>Yoga</i> and <i>Sāṅkhya</i>, and cause the religion of <i>nivṛtti</i> to flow in the worlds. <i>Kṣetrajña</i> is myself…<i>Brahmán's</i> son <i>Rudra</i> has sprung from his brow at his command…In the <i>Kṛta-yuga</i> living creatures should not be slain in the sacrifices; in the <i>Tretā-yuga</i> animals, dedicated with <i>mantras</i>, will be slain in the sacrifices; then comes the mixed (<i>miśraḥ) yuga Dvāpara</i>; then <i>Tiṣya</i> with <i>Kali</i> in the van.” <i>Vyāsa</i> continued: D. and Ṛ. went away. Only <i>Brahmán</i> remained, desirous of beholding the great god, then residing in the form of <i>Amruddha</i>; the god then showed himself to <i>Brahmán</i> with a vast equine head, etc. (description), saying that at times he would appear in incarnate forms. Then he disappeared, and <i>Brahmán</i> proceeded to his own region. “Do you bow to him who is the lord of the <i>Rudras</i>, etc. (π).” Blessing upon the reader (XII, <b>341</b>). <i>Janamejaya</i> inquired of the meaning of the different names of <i>Nārāyaṇa; Vaiśampāyana</i> related what <i>Keśava</i> (Kṛṣṇa) had said to <i>Phālguna</i> (Arjuna), when the latter asked him about the signification of his names mentioned by M.-ṛ. in the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Purāṇas</i>. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said: In the <i>Ṛgveda</i>, etc. (ρ), many are the names that have been mentioned by M.-ṛ.; “from <i>Nārāyaṇa's</i> [as <i>Aniruddha</i>] grace has arisen <i>Brahmán</i>, and from his wrath has arisen <i>Rudra</i>”; description of <i>Rudra</i> (σ); “I adored in days of yore the ancient <i>Rudra</i> for obtaining the boon of a son; <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (τ), adore <i>Hari Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu</i>).” Etymology of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, etc. (υ); “Ṛ <i>Trita</i>, the eldest (<i>ādyaḥ</i>) son of <i>Brahmán</i>, when thrown into a well by <i>Ekata</i> and <i>Dvita</i>, invoked me as <i>Pṛśnigarbha</i> and was rescued from the pit; <i>Dīrghatamas</i> (§ 170) invoked me as <i>Keśava</i>, became cured of his blindness, and then came to be called <i>Gotama</i> (v. Nīl.); <i>Agni</i> and <i>Soma</i>, blending together, became transfused in one and the same substance (<i>ekayonitvam āgataḥ)…</i>, in the <i>Purāṇa</i> this is said, and further that the gods have <i>Agni</i> for their mouth” (XII, <b>342</b>). Asked by <i>Arjuna</i> about the unity of nature of <i>Agni</i> and <i>Soma, Kṛṣṇa</i> related this ancient story: I) When only the infinite water (quotation of the <i>śruti</i>) exists (called <i>tamas</i>), <i>Bráhman > Puruṣa > Brahmán</i>, who caused <i>Agni</i> (the <i>kṣatra</i>) and <i>Soma</i> (<i>bráhman</i>, i.e. the <i>brahmans</i>) to spring from his own eyes (quotation of the <i>śruti</i> relating to <i>Agni</i>); <i>Agni</i> is the <i>hotṛ</i> and the <i>brahmán</i> of the sacrifice; he who offers food in the mouth of a <i>brahman</i> is said to pour libations into the sacred fire for gratifying the deities (quotation from Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa); in this way <i>brahmans</i> have come to be regarded as <i>Agni. Agni</i> is again <i>Viṣṇu</i> (quoting <i>Sanatkumāra</i>).—II) By <i>Gautama's</i> curse (for his assault on <i>Ahalyā</i>), <i>Indra</i> got a green beard; through the curse of <i>Kauśika, Indra</i> lost his testicles and got those of a ram.—III) As <i>Indra</i> with uplifted thunderbolt would prevent the <i>Aśvins</i> from receiving a share in sacrifice (<i>graha-), Cyavana</i> paralysed his arms.—IV) Incensed at the destruction of his sacrifice, <i>Dakṣa</i> by his austerities caused a third eye to appear on the forehead of <i>Rudra</i>.—V) When <i>Rudra</i> would destroy <i>Tripura, Uśanas</i> tore a matted lock from his head and hurled it at <i>Rudra</i>, whence serpents began to bite <i>Rudra</i>, whose throat became blue, just as in the <i>Svāyambhuva Manvantara</i>, when <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> seized <i>Rudra</i> by the throat.—VI) When <i>Aṅgiras Bṛhaspati</i> sat [on the shores of the ocean] to make preparation for the churning in order to raise the <i>amṛta</i> and touched water (<i>upaspṛśataḥ</i>), the water was not clear (<i>na prasādaṃ gatavatyaḥ</i>); he became angry and [cursed] the ocean, saying: “From this day thou shalt be tainted with fishes, etc.”—VII) <i>Viśvarūpa Triśiras</i> <i>Tvāṣṭra</i> was the <i>purohita</i> of the gods; he was the sister-son of the <i>Asuras</i>; while publicly offering to the deities he secretly offered shares to the <i>Asuras</i>; the <i>Asuras</i> with <i>Hiraṇyakaśipu</i> at their head prevailed upon him through his mother, that he (who had come to the <i>Nandana</i> wood) should aid <i>Hiraṇyakaśipu</i>, who was cursed by <i>Hairaṇyagarbha</i> <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, saying: “Since thou hast chosen another <i>hotṛ</i>, thy sacrifice shall not be completed, and thou shalt be slain by a hitherto unknown kind of being.” <i>Viśvarūpa</i> performed austere <i>tapas; Indra</i> sent <i>Apsarases</i>, of whom <i>Viśvarūpa</i> became enamoured, and he promised to destroy <i>Indra</i> and the gods; he uttered <i>mantras</i> by which he grew; with one mouth he drank all the <i>soma</i> that was offered to the gods by the brahmans in all the worlds; with one [he ate] food; with one [he drank the energy of all] the gods, including <i>Indra</i>. These repaired to <i>Brahmán</i> (so B.; <i>Brāhmaṇaṃ</i>, C.), and according to his counsel they prevailed upon Ṛ. <i>Bhārgava</i> <i>Dadhīca</i>, that he should abandon his body by his <i>yoga</i> power; his bones <i>Dhātṛ</i> shaped into a thunderbolt (<i>vajra</i>), which was pervaded by the energy of <i>Viṣṇu</i>; with this <i>vajra Indra</i> struck <i>Viśvarūpa</i>, and severed the heads from the body. By the pressing (<i>mathana</i>) of his limbs <i>Vṛtra</i> came into existence, whom <i>Indra</i> slew. Terrified with the double brahmanicide, <i>Indra</i> abandoned the sovereignty of the gods; he entered a cool lotus-stalk in the <i>Mānasa</i> lake, and becoming very minute (<i>aṇumātraḥ</i>) by his <i>yoga</i> power (<i>aiśvarya-yogāt</i>) he entered the fibres of that lotus-stalk. Now <i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas</i> assailed the deities; the <i>mantras</i> of M.-ṛ. lost their efficacy (<i>na prāvartanta</i>), Rā. appeared; the <i>Vedas (Brahma</i>) were about to disappear (<i>utsādanaṃ jagāma</i>); without an <i>Indra</i>, the worlds lost their strength and became easy to overwhelm. Then the gods and <i>Ṛṣis</i> crowned <i>Āyus'</i> son <i>Nahuṣa</i> as king of the gods. <i>Nahuṣa</i> ruled over heaven with 500 luminaries on his forehead, which had the virtue of robbing the energy of every creature. Then follows, somewhat abbreviated, the contents of § 555 (Indra) = V, <b>11</b> foll.—VIII) In days of yore, when M.-ṛ. <i>Bharadvāja</i> was saying his prayers (<i>upāspṛśat</i>) on the shore of the celestial <i>Gaṅgā</i>, he was approached by <i>Viṣṇu</i>, who was taking his three strides; <i>Viṣṇu</i>, struck with water by <i>Bharadvāja</i> on the breast, received a mark [i.e. Śrīvatsa] on his breast.—IX) Cursed by M.-ṛ. <i>Bhṛgu</i>, <i>Agni</i> was obliged to become a devourer of all things.— X) <i>Aditi</i> cooked food for the gods to strengthen them so that they might slay the <i>Asuras</i>; there <i>Budha</i> [i.e. the planet Mercury], after completing a vow (<i>vratacaryā-</i>), came and asked for alms of <i>Aditi</i>; but she, intending that only the gods should eat it first, gave him no alms. At this <i>Budha (Brahmabhūtaḥ</i>) cursed <i>Aditi</i>, saying that she would have a pain (<i>vyathā</i>) in her womb; in the second birth (as an egg) of <i>Vivasvat</i>, the egg of [his] mother <i>Aditi</i> [was] killed (so B.); [therefore] <i>Vivasvat Śrāddhadeva</i> [became] <i>Mārttaṇḍa</i>.—XI) <i>Dakṣa</i> had sixty daughters, of whom he gave thirteen to <i>Kaśyapa</i>, ten to <i>Dharma</i>, ten to <i>Manu</i>, and twenty-seven (the <i>Nakṣatras</i>) to <i>Soma</i>;; although the latter were all alike in respect of beauty, etc., yet <i>Soma</i> became more attached to <i>Rohiṇī</i>, and was cursed by <i>Dakṣa</i>, etc., cf. § 615 (Prabhāsotpattikathana) = IX, <b>35</b>; <i>Prabhāsa</i> in the western ocean was originally called <i>Hiraṇyasaras</i>; from this curse also have come the dark spots in the disc of the moon, exhibiting the mark of a hare.—XII) M.-ṛ. <i>Sthūlaśiras</i> practised austerities on the north-eastern side of <i>Meru</i>; a breeze, charged with all delicious perfumes, gratifled him; the trees around him [from jealousy] put forth their flowers to make a display; he cursed them, saying that they should not have flowers at all times.—XIII) <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, in days of yore, for the good of the world, became M.-ṛ. <i>Vaḍavāmukha</i>; practising austerities on <i>Meru</i>, he summoned the ocean; but it did not come; he then, with the heat of his body, evaporated its water and caused it to become as saltish in taste as the human sweat; it should cease to be drinkable; only to <i>Vaḍavāmukha</i> it should be sweet, when he drinks it; therefore, to this day, the water from the ocean is drunk only by <i>Vaḍavāmukha</i>, who lives within it (<i>anuvartinā</i>).— XIV) <i>Umā</i>, the daughter of the mountain <i>Himavat</i>, was desired in marriage by <i>Rudra</i>; M.-ṛ. <i>Bhṛgu</i>, was refused, and therefore he brought about that <i>Himavat</i> ceased to abound with jewels and gems. Even such is the glory of the brahman. [Almost the whole of the preceding part of this chapter is in prose.]—Etymologies of <i>Hṛṣīkeśa</i>, etc. (ϕ); Ṛ. <i>Yāska</i>, having adored me by the name of <i>Śipiviṣṭa</i>, succeeded in restoring (<i>abhijagmivān</i>) the <i>Nirukta</i>, which had disappeared into the nether regions (<i>adho naṣṭaṃ</i>). Other identifications with <i>Nāvāyaṇa</i> (χ); Ṛ. <i>Pāñcāla</i>, etc. (ψ), aided by <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>; etymology of <i>Dharmaja</i>, etc. (ω).—Asked by <i>Arjuna</i> about that battle between <i>Rudra</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa</i> related: All the universe became suddenly filled with anxiety, etc. (αα); peace was brought about by <i>Brahmán</i>; the mark made by <i>Rudra's</i> lance on <i>Nārāyaṇa's</i> cheek should assume the form of a beautiful whirl, and <i>Rudra</i> should be called <i>Śrīkaṇṭha</i> from the mark of <i>Nārāyaṇa's</i> hand on his throat.— The two Ṛ. <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> then made friends with <i>Rudra</i>, and, dismissing the gods, once more set themselves to penances. “In this way, O son of <i>Kuntī!</i> assuming diverse forms do I rove at will through the earth, <i>Brahmaloka</i>, and the high and eternal region of felicity called <i>Goloka</i>. That being, whom, at the time of all thy battles, thou beheldest stalking in thy van, is no other than <i>Rudra;…</i> those foes whom thou hast slain, were all, in the first instance, slain by him” (XII, <b>343</b>). <i>Śaunaka</i> asked, why <i>Nārada</i>, having seen the Supreme Lord in the form of <i>Aniruddha</i>, again proceeded so quickly to <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa. Sauti</i> said: At an interval in his snake-sacrifice, <i>Janamejaya</i> addressed his great-grandfather <i>Vyāsa</i>, asking him this same question, etc. (ββ). <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> answered: Leaving <i>Śvetadvīpa, Nārada</i> quickly proceeded to <i>Meru</i>, full of wonder, thence to <i>Gandhamādana</i>, and, traversing the sky, to <i>Badarī</i>, where he saw the Ṛ. [<i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>], engaged in penances, both with <i>Śrīvatsa</i> and matted locks, both with “the swan's foot” on their palms, etc., each of them with four <i>muṣkas</i>. (v. the note of PCR., p. 822), sixty teeth, and four arms, etc. (description), and told them what he had seen at <i>Śvetadvīpa</i>, and that the marks of <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> were the same that he had seen on the Supreme Soul; “that realm, where he resides, the Sun warms not, etc.; having constructed an altar, measuring eight fingers' breadth, he is practising penances there, standing on one foot, etc.; whatever libations…are poured on the sacrificial fire by Ṛ., etc. (γγ), all reach the feet of that great deity” (XII, <b>344</b>). Discourse of <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyana</i> to <i>Nārada</i> about <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>; “<i>Sūrya</i> is said to be the door [through which the emancipate must pass]; entering <i>Sūrya</i>, their bodies are consumed by his fire; they then become invisible…; reduced to invisible atoms they then enter into <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> [who resides in the centre of <i>Sūrya</i>] > <i>Aniruddha</i> > (losing all physical attributes and transformed into mind alone) <i>Pradyumna > Saṅkarṣaṇa</i> (<i>Jīva</i>) (both those conversant with <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and those that are devoted to the Supreme deity) > <i>Kṣetrajña (= Vāsudeva</i>) divested of <i>sattva, rajas</i>, and <i>tamas;…</i> thou wert beheld by us in <i>Śvetadvīpa</i>.” D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i> became entirely devoted to <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, and dwelt in <i>Badarī</i> for 1,000 celestial years (XII, <b>345</b>). <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> related the discourse between <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> on one side and <i>Nārada</i> on the other about the rites in honour of the <i>Pitṛs. Nārada</i>, the son of <i>Dakṣa</i>, was originally the son of <i>Brahmán</i>, created before all others by a fiat of his will. On one occasion the deities taught their children [the <i>Pitṛs</i>] the <i>śrutis</i>, and, having lost their knowledge, had to acquire it again from those sons (v. the note of PCR., p. 829); the gods and the <i>Pitṛs</i>, placing three <i>piṇḍas</i> on some blades of <i>kuśa-</i>grass, worshipped each other. Then <i>Nārada</i> asked why the <i>Pitṛs</i> in days of yore acquired the name of <i>piṇḍas. Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> said: The earth, in days of yore, disappeared, and was raised up by <i>Govinda (Vṛṣākapi</i>) in the shape of a gigantic boar; when the hour came for his morning prayers, he, suddenly shaking off three balls of mud from his tusk, placed them upon the earth and dedicated them to his own self, saying that he was resolved to create those that were to be called <i>Pitṛs</i>; seeing that the three balls of mud had fallen towards the south, he declared that these should be known henceforth by the name of <i>Pitṛs</i>. Having then offered those <i>piṇḍas</i> on the <i>Vārāha</i> mountain, worshipping his own self, he disappeared. Therefore those who sacrifice to the <i>Pitṛs</i>, etc., sacrifice, etc., to <i>Viṣṇu</i> himself (XII, <b>346</b>). <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> continued: D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>, after 1,000 years, repaired to his own retreat on <i>Himavat</i>, while <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> remained in <i>Badarī</i>, engaged in austerities; “the ancestors of that person who hates <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, sink into hell for ever”; glorification of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, citing <i>Vyāsa</i> and referring to <i>Harigītā</i> (i.e. Bhagavadgītā); “<i>Vyāsa</i> is <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> on earth; who else could compile such a treatise as the <i>Mahābhārata</i> ? Having listened to the diverse kinds of duties and resolved upon a horse-sacrifice, let thy great sacrifice go on.” <i>—Sauti</i> continued: Formerly <i>Nārada</i> had recited the discourse about <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> to my preceptor in the hearing of many Ṛ. and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i>. <i>Sauti's</i> eulogium on <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (δδ) (XII, <b>347</b>). <i>Śaunaka</i> said: “I have heard from thee the glory of the Supreme Soul, etc. (εε); the form of <i>Viṣṇu</i> with the equine head, that appeared in the great ocean on the north-east was beheld by <i>Brahmán Parameṣṭhin</i>.” <i>Śaunaka</i> then inquired why <i>Hari</i> had appeared, in the form of <i>Aniruddha</i> with the horse-head, to <i>Brahmán. Sauti</i> said he would recite that which <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> recited to <i>Janamejaya</i> (in the Snakesacrifice), who put the same question to <i>Vaiśampāyana</i>. <i>Janamejaya</i> put the question to <i>Vaiśampāyana. Vaiśampāyana</i> expounded how the destruction is brought about of all things; then “from the primeval darkness (fraught with immortality) arises <i>Bráhman > Puruṣa = Aniruddha =</i> <i>Pradhāna</i> (divested of sex) = <i>Avyakta = Viśvaksena Hari</i>, who, yielding to <i>yoga-</i>sleep (<i>nidrāyogaṃ</i>), lays himself down on the waters thinking of the creation; > <i>Ahaṅkāra =</i> <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. = <i>Hiraṇyagarbha</i>, who takes birth within the lotus [that springs] from <i>Aniruddha</i>. Adopting the attribute of <i>sattva (sattvasthaḥ), Brahmán</i> commenced to create the universe. In the primeval lotus two drops of water had been deposited by <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>: one like honey (<i>madhu</i>) which became <i>Madhu</i> made up of <i>tamas</i>; the other hard (<i>kaṭhina</i>) which became <i>Kaiṭabha</i> made up of <i>rajas</i>; these two <i>Asuras</i> (<i>Dānavas</i>), armed with maces, beheld within the lotus <i>Brahmán</i> creating the four <i>Vedas</i>, seized them, and dived to <i>Rasā[-tala]</i> in the north-eastern ocean.” <i>Brahmán</i> complained before <i>Īśāna</i> (ζζ); then he hymned <i>Hari</i> (ηη): “my first birth from thee was due to a fiat of thy will; my second birth in days of yore was from thy eyes; my third birth was from thy speech; my fourth birth was from thy ears; my fifth birth was from thy nose; my sixth birth was from an egg; this is my seventh birth, in this lotus.” <i>Puruṣa</i> rose from his slumber and assumed an equine head, he who was the abode of the <i>Vedas</i>; the firmament became the crown of his head, etc. (θθ); then he disappeared and proceeded to <i>Rasā[-tala]</i>; there he set himself to <i>yoga</i>, and adopting a voice according to the <i>śikṣā</i> he began to loudly utter Vedic mantras. The two <i>Asuras</i>, making an appointment with the <i>Vedas</i> as to the time of their return, threw them down to <i>Rasātala</i> and ran after the sound. Meanwhile <i>Hari</i> took up all the <i>Vedas</i> and gave them to <i>Brahmán</i>; he placed the horse-head in the northeastern ocean, [which horse-head], moreover, [was] the abode (<i>ālayaṃ</i>) of the <i>Vedas</i>, and thence he was called (<i>babhūta</i>) <i>Aśvaśivas</i> (“horse-headed”). Returning to the lotus, <i>Madhu</i> and <i>Kaiṭabha</i> saw him in the form of <i>Aniruddha</i> in <i>yoga-</i> sleep on the water, white, endued with stainless <i>sattva</i>, on the hood of a snake surrounded with a garland of flames. They awakened him and were slain by him; thence he came to be called <i>Madhusūdana</i>. Aided then by <i>Hari</i> and assisted by the <i>Vedas, Brahmán</i> created all the worlds. Then <i>Hari</i> disappeared. Once more, however, he assumed the same form for the sake of the religion of <i>pravṛtti</i> (<i>pravṛttidharmārthaṃ</i> B.; C. <i>°ttiṃdha°</i>). The brahman who frequently (<i>nityaṃ</i>) hears or mentally recites (<i>dhārayīta</i>) this story, will never forget his [Vedic or other] lore. Having adored with austere penances the god with the equine head, Ṛ. <i>Pañcala</i> [i.e. <i>Gālava</i>, PCR.] acquired [the science of] <i>Krama</i> proceeding along the path pointed out by the deity [i.e. <i>Rudra</i>, PCR.; cf. XII, <b>343</b>, 13261—63]. <i>Hari</i> is the receptacle (<i>nidhiḥ</i>) of the <i>Vedas</i>, and of penances, and <i>yoga</i>, etc. (ιι); <i>ṛta</i>, etc. (κκ), has <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> for its soul; the Supreme Being is the cause of all this as <i>Puruṣa</i> and as <i>Pradhāna</i>; he is the agent, etc.; the thoughts of-all, including <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (λλ), are known to <i>Keśava</i>; but none of these can know what his thoughts are, etc.; he is called <i>Vāsudeva</i> because of his being the abode of all creatures; he is the eternal highest M.-ṛ., etc.; only the M. ṛ. that have knowledge for their souls behold the eternal <i>Puruṣa</i> who transcends all attributes (<i>guṇādhikaṃ</i>) (XII, <b>348</b>). <i>Janamejaya</i> said that the <i>ekāntins</i> [i.e. those who are devoted to <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> with their whole souls] at once attain to the fourth or highest end (i.e. <i>Puruṣottama</i>) without going through the three [i.e. <i>Aniruddha, Pradyumna</i>, and <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa</i>; PCR.], and this end is better than that attained to by brahmans studying the <i>Vedas</i> with the <i>Upaniṣads</i>, etc., and by <i>Yatis</i>; and he asked who first promulgated the religion of Devotion.—<i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: When the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> and the <i>Kuru</i> armies were drawn up in array for the battle, and <i>Arjuna</i> became cheerless, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> himself explained this religion [sc. in the Bhagavadgītā]. Having created this religion in the <i>Kṛta</i> age it is borne by <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> himself. <i>Nārada</i> was questioned about it by <i>Arjuna</i> in the midst of Ṛ. and in the presence of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i>. My preceptor <i>Vyāsa</i> heard what D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i> said, and imparted it to me.—I) In that <i>Kalpa</i>, when <i>Brahmán</i> took his birth in (A) the mind of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (<i>mānasaṃ janma</i>) and issued from the latter's mouth, <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> himself performed the rites of this religion. From him it passed to Ṛ. <i>Phenapaḥ</i> (froth-drinking) <i>> Vaikhānasāḥ > Soma</i>; then it disappeared.—II) A: the eyes of <i>Nārāyaṇa (cākṣusaṃ janma): Soma > Brahmán ></i> <i>Rudra ></i> Ṛ. <i>Vālakhilyāḥ</i> (in the <i>Kṛta</i> age); then it once more disappeared through the illusive power of that god [<i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, PCR.].—III) A: the speech of <i>Nārāyaṇa (vācikaṃ</i>): <i>Nārāyaṇa ></i> Ṛ. <i>Suparṇa</i> (who recited it thrice [a day, PCR.]— <i>triḥ parikrāntavān</i>—whence it came to be called <i>Trisauparṇa</i>, referred to in the <i>Ṛgveda</i>) > <i>Vāyu</i> > Ṛ. <i>Vighasāśinaḥ</i> [i.e. who subsist on remains of sacrifices after feeding guests, etc.], > the ocean (<i>mahodadhiḥ</i>); it once more disappeared and became merged (<i>-samāhitaḥ</i>) into <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>.—IV) A: the ear of <i>Nārāyaṇa (śravaṇajā sṛṣṭiḥ): Nārāyaṇa > Brahmán</i> (“…together with the <i>Āraṇyakas</i>”) > <i>Manu Svārociṣa</i> > his son <i>Śaṅkhapada</i> > his son <i>Suvarṇābha (diśāṃ pālaṃ</i>); when the <i>Tretā yuga</i> came it once more disappeared.— V) A: the nose of <i>Nārāyaṇa (nāsatye janmani): Nārāyaṇa ></i> <i>Brahmán > Sanatkumāra > Prajāpati Vīraṇa</i> (in the beginning of the <i>Kṛta</i> age) > the <i>muni Raibhya</i> > his son <i>Kukṣi</i> (<i>diśām pālāya</i>); then it disappeared.—VI) A: an egg [that sprang from <i>Hari</i>, PCR.] (<i>aṇḍaje janmani): Nārāyaṇa ></i> <i>Brahmán ></i> Mu. <i>Barhiṣads > Jyeṣṭha</i> (a brahman who had mastered the whole <i>Sāmaveda</i>) > king <i>Avikalpana</i> (B. <i>°kampa°</i>); then it disappeared.—VII) A: the lotus that sprang from the navel of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (this seventh birth, <i>padmajaṃ</i>): <i>Nārāyaṇa > Brahmán > Dakṣa ></i> his eldest daughter's son <i>Āditya</i> (elder brother of <i>Savitṛ</i>) <i>> Vivasvat ></i> <i>Manu</i> (in the beginning of the <i>Tretā yuga</i>) > his son <i>Ikṣvāku ></i> the whole world; when the universal destruction comes (<i>kṣayānte</i>) it will once more return to <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>.— The religion of the <i>Yatis</i> has been narrated to thee in the <i>Harigītā. Nārada</i> got it from <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> himself. <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> is adored (<i>dṛśyate</i>) as of one form (<i>ekavyūhavibhāgaḥ</i> [i.e. as <i>Aniruddha</i>, PCR.]), or of two [do. + <i>Pradyumna</i>], or three [do. + <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa</i>] or four [do. + <i>Vāsudeva</i>].—<i>Janamejaya</i> asked why all persons do not follow the religion of Devotion. <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> pointed to <i>Sattva, rajas</i>, and <i>tamas. Hari</i> casts a kind eye upon the person endued with <i>sattva</i>; only <i>Brahmán</i> looks kindly upon him who is overwhelmed with <i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas</i>; D. and Ṛ. are given to <i>sattva</i>, but [the deities] not in its subtle form.—Asked by <i>Janamejaya</i> how one may attain to the Supreme Being (<i>Puruṣottama</i>), and about <i>pravṛtti, Vaiśampāyana</i> said that the <i>Sāṅkhya-Yoga</i>, the <i>Veda</i> and <i>Āraṇyakas (Vedāraṇyakaṃ</i>), and the <i>Pañcarātra</i> are parts of one whole (<i>parasparāṅgāni</i>), and even this is the religion of the <i>Ekāntins</i>, the <i>Sāttvika</i> religion, the <i>Ekāntagati</i> of the Yatis of Śvetadvīpa (v. <i>Śveta</i>, pl.; differently PCR., v. the note, p. 852). <i>Vyāsa</i> imparted this religion to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (XII, <b>349</b>).—<i>Janamejaya</i> asked whether the <i>Sāṅkhya, Pañcarātra</i> (B. <i>Pā°</i>), and <i>Vedāraṇyaka</i> are <i>ekaniṣṭha</i> (“preaching courses of duties,”) PCR.) or <i>pṛthaṅniṣṭha</i> (“preaching courses of duties different from one another,” PCR.), and about <i>pravṛtti</i>. M.-ṛ. <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: “I bow to M.-ṛ. [<i>Vyāsa</i>] (cf. § 77 = I, <b>63</b>), the sixth in the series beginning with <i>Pitāmaha</i> (Brahmán), sprung from a portion of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, the only son [of his parents], whom <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> in the first ages (<i>ādikāleṣu</i>) created as his son, the unborn and ancient (<i>ajaṃ purāṇaṃ</i>), the great receptacle of the <i>Vedas. Janamejaya</i> said: When <i>Vasiṣṭha > Śaktri ></i> <i>Parāśaṛa > Vyāsa</i>, how can <i>Vyāsa</i> be the son of <i>Nārāyaṇa?</i> <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: <i>Vyāsa</i> dwelt for some time on the <i>Himavat</i>; he became tired of his penances owing to the great work of composing the Mahābhārata (<i>Bhāratam</i> <i>ākhyānaṃ</i>), waited upon by his disciples, <i>Sumantu</i>, etc. (μμ), recapitulating (<i>āvartayan</i>) the <i>Vedas</i>, etc. (νν); asked by us, <i>Vyāsa</i> related: This narrative, belonging to the early times (<i>ādikālodbhavaṃ</i>), has become known to me through my penances. In the seventh creation, that from the lotus (<i>prajāvisarge vai saptame padmasambhave), Brahmán</i> being hesitating on account of the difficulty of creating, <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> caused Intelligence (<i>Buddhi</i>) to enter <i>Brahmán</i>, who now created Dai., Dā., G., and Rā., etc.; seeing that many of these would afflict D. and Ṛ., <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> resolved upon incarnations (as boar, man-lion, dwarf, man), and upon upholding the earth as a snake in <i>Pātāla</i>. Then uttering the syllable <i>bho</i>, he, from the voice (<i>Sarasvatī</i>) created <i>Sārasvata Apāntaratamas</i>, whom he caused to distribute the <i>Vedas</i> in the <i>[Manu]antara</i> of <i>Manu Svāyambhuva</i>, saying that he should do thus in each <i>Manvantara</i>, and, when <i>Tiṣya</i> (i.e. Kali-yuga) had set in, he should become the father of the <i>Kauravas</i>, etc., and distribute the <i>Vedas</i> into diverse classes, and be of a dark complexion, born from M.-ṛ. <i>Parāśara</i> in <i>Vasiṣṭha's</i> (the mind-born son of <i>Brahmán</i>) line by a maiden; he should know the past, the present, and the future; not he, but his son, should be freed from passion (<i>rāgāt</i>); he should see <i>Kṛṣṇa; Sūrya's</i> son <i>Śanaiśvara</i> [i.e. the planet Saturn] will be a great <i>Manu</i> [read with B. <i>Manur</i> = Manu Sāvarṇi? during his Manvantara Vyāsa will be one of the seven Ṛṣis]; during that <i>Manvantara</i> thou shalt be the foremost of the class beginning with <i>Manu</i> (<i>Manu-</i> <i>ādi-gaṇa-pūrvakaḥ</i> [i.e. of the Manu, gods, Ṛṣis, etc., in the respective Manvantara]).” <i>Vyāsa</i> said: “I am he that was born as <i>Apāntaratamas</i>; I underwent, in days of yore, the austerest penances.”—<i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: the preceptors (<i>vaktṛ, vettṛ</i>) of the diverse systems (<i>jñānāni</i>) are: 1) of <i>Sāṅkhya</i>: the great Ṛ. <i>Kapila</i>; 2) of <i>Yoga</i> (read <i>yogasya</i> with B.): the primeval (<i>purātanaḥ) Hiraṇyagarbha</i>; 3) of the <i>Vedas</i>: Ṛ. <i>Apāntaratamas</i>, by some called <i>Prācīnagarbha</i>; 4) of <i>Pāśupata: Śiva</i> (the son of <i>Brahmán</i>); 5) of <i>Pañcarātra</i> (B. <i>Pā°</i>): <i>Bhagavat</i> [i.e. Nārāyaṇa], and he may be seen in all the systems. The <i>Sāṅkhya, Yoga</i>, and <i>Vedas</i> are eternal; those conversant with the <i>Pañcarātra</i> (B. <i>Pā°</i>) enter <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>; all acts spring from Ṛ. <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (XII, <b>350</b>).— <i>Janamejaya</i> asked whether there are many <i>Puruṣas</i> or only one, etc. <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said that in the <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and <i>Yoga</i> many <i>Puruṣas</i> are spoken of; but as the many <i>Puruṣas</i> have only one origin (<i>yoniḥ</i>), so the one <i>Puruṣa</i> is the universe (<i>viśvaṃ</i>) above the qualities (<i>guṇādhihaṃ</i>), citing the <i>Vedas</i>, etc. (ξξ), and the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Brahmán</i> and <i>Tryambaka</i> (Śiva), i.e. <is>Brahma-</is> <is>Rudra-saṃvāda</is> (<i>d</i>) (XII, <b>351—2</b>)."

one who recites this while on journey reaches his destination safely; (in short) whatever desire a person entertains that he definitely gets; this is the considered assurance of the great sage (<i>idaṃ maharṣer vacanaṃ viniś-</i> <i>citam</i>) that by listening to the praise of the Excellent Person (<i>puruṣavara</i>) the devotees are very comfortable (<i>niśamya bhaktāḥ su-</i> <i>sukhaṃ labhante</i>) 12. 327. 102-107. <b>H.</b> End: After listening to this great Nārāyaṇīya <i>ākhyāna,</i> king Janamejaya resumed all the rites necessary for the completion of the (snake) sacrifice (<i>etad tu mahad ākhyānaṃ</i> <i>śrutvā pārikṣito nṛpaḥ / tato yajñasamā-</i> <i>ptyarthaṃ kriyāḥ sarvāḥ samārabhat //</i> 12. 334. 11). [See <b>Puruṣasukta, Hayaśiras</b>]"
