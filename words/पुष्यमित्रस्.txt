Divekar suggested the reading <i>Yudhy-amitrān</i> in place of <i>Puṣyamitrān.</i> But, as pointed out by R.D. Banerji,<sup>399</sup> the proposed reading is impossible. <dvsn n='P'/>There are several views about the identification of the Puṣyamitras. <dvsn n='HI'/>(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the Purāṇas as <i>Paṭumitras</i> and located them on the Narmadā.<sup>400</sup> <dvsn n='HI'/>(ii) V.A. Smith<sup>401</sup> regarded them as a people of the North. <dvsn n='HI'/>(iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the <i>Maitrakas.</i><sup>402</sup> <dvsn n='HI'/>(iv) R.D. Banerji<sup>403</sup> regarded them as the first wave of the Hūṇas. <dvsn n='HI'/>(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.<sup>404</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been <i>mitras</i> or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar, “there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support, for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.<sup>405</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacrifices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta. <dvsn n='P'/>We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.<sup>406</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in the Bhitari Inscription.<sup>407</sup> “By whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;<sup>408</sup> is also not acceptable as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.<sup>409</sup> Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled against Skandagupta. <dvsn n='P'/>The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the <i>Vindhyakas.</i> In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.<sup>410</sup> Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Narmadā”.<sup>411</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa, according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not been named.<sup>412</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The mention of <i>Vindhyakas,</i> evidently a people of the Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were a people of the North is not acceptable. <dvsn n='P'/>Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.<sup>413</sup> This is supported by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by D.B. Diskalkar,<sup>414</sup> from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising of the Puṣyamitras in that region.<sup>415</sup>"
