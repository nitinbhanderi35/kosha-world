He built in Ayodhyā a temple for the Sun-god and appointed, for a year, paying his wages in advance, a scholar well versed in Purāṇas to read aloud the Purāṇas in the temple. After six months Dhanapāla died and as a result of the goodness accrued to him by his worthy deeds the Sun-god came to him with his chariot and took him to his place and seating him on his seat paid respects to him. Later he was taken to Brahmaloka. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brahma Kāṇḍa, Chapter 94)."
