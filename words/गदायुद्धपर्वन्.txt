Gadāparvan, Gadāyuddha. § 613: Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (α), <i>Sañjaya</i> related: <i>Duryodhana</i> agreed to fight his foes, one at a time (β); <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> granted his request, adding that if he could slay even one of the five <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> he would remain king. <i>Duryodhana</i> rose from the lake and challenged the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (γ); <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> taunted him with his unfair conduct in slaying <i>Abhimanyu</i> (δ) (IX, <b>32</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> reproved <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> for his rashness in staking everything on the result of such a single combat with <i>Duryodhana</i> (ε); <i>Bhīmasena</i> assured <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> that <i>Duryodhana</i> would be no match for him in an encounter with the mace (ζ); <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> applauded <i>Bhīma</i>, and exhorted him to slay <i>Duryodhana</i> (η); <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (θ), applauded <i>Bhīma; Bhīma's</i> boastful address (ι) to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Duryodhana; Duryodhana's</i> dignified reply, applauded by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Sṛñjayas</i>; the elephants began to grunt and the steeds to neigh; the weapons of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> blazed forth of their own accord (IX, <b>33</b>).—§ 614: When the battle between <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> was about to commence, <i>Bala-Rāma (b</i>), having heard that that battle between his two disciples was about to begin, came and was worshipped by the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (α); he said that forty-two days had passed since he departed, having set out under the constellation <i>Puṣya</i> and come back under the constellation <i>Śravaṇa</i>; he was clad in blue robes and of fair complexion. Then that dreadful encounter took place (IX, <b>34</b>).—§ 615: Requested by <i>Janamejaya</i> (α), <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> related how <i>Bala-Rāma</i> had determined upon and set out (under the constellation <i>Maitra</i>) on a pilgrimage to the <i>tīrthas</i> on the <i>Sarasvatī</i> (β), having let the sacred fire be brought from <i>Dvārakā</i> and the priests, and having given away rich donations to everyone who wished for them, accompanied by priests, friends, brahmans, chariots, elephants, steeds, and servants, visiting all the sacred places along her course. In the course of his wanderings he at last came to <i>Kurukṣetra</i>. Requested by <i>Janamejaya</i> (γ), <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> related the <i>Baladevatīrthayātrā</i> (q.v.) (IX, <b>35—54</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> related: Beholding <i>Bala-Rāma, Duryodhana</i> rejoiced. According to the proposal of <i>Bala-Rāma, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with his brothers and <i>Duryodhana</i> proceeded westwards to <i>Samanta-</i> <i>pañcaka</i> on the southern side of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>. D. and Cā. praised <i>Duryodhana</i>. Description of <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> (ο). <i>Duryodhana</i> told <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (who was standing among his brothers and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Rāma</i>) to behold the battle, protected by the <i>Kaikeyas</i>, etc. (π). That large assembly of kings sat down, as did also <i>Bala-Rāma</i>, who was worshipped by all around him. <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> stood inciting each other with violent speeches (IX, <b>55</b>). The dispute between the two heroes (ρ). At last <i>Duryodhana</i> said, “What is the use of bragging? fight with me,” and was applauded by the <i>Somakas</i>, etc. The elephants grunted aloud and the steeds neighed repeatedly; the weapons of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> blazed forth of their own accord (IX, <b>56</b>). Description of the combat; D., G., and men wondered; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Somakas</i> feared; adopting the manœuvre called <i>Kauśika</i>, <i>Duryodhana</i> baffled <i>Bhīma's</i> mace; as <i>Duryodhana</i> once fell down to the earth, the <i>Sṛñjayas</i> cried aloud, so also did the <i>Pāṇḍavas; Bhīmasena</i> then had his coat of mail fractured and was prostrated on the ground, but rose, steadying himself with great effort (IX, <b>57</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> inquired of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> about the relative merits of the two combatants; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that their training had been equal, but <i>Bhīma</i> was superior in strength; <i>Duryodhana</i> was superior in skill and had had more practice; by fighting fairly <i>Bhīma</i> would never succeed in winning, but by fighting unfairly he would surely be able to slay <i>Duryodhana</i>, just as the <i>Asuras</i> were vanquished by the gods, <i>Virocana</i> and <i>Vṛtra</i> by <i>Indra</i> with the aid of deception; “<i>Bhīma</i> has vowed to break the thighs of <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> with his mace; let him accomplish that vow of his”; he censured <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> for his folly, and quoted a verse uttered by <i>Uśanas</i>; “<i>Duryodhana</i> has practised with the mace for full thirteen years.” <i>Arjuna</i> struck his own left thigh before the eyes of <i>Bhīmasena</i>, who understood the sign. As <i>Duryodhana</i> set his heart on the manœuvre called <i>dvasthāna</i> and jumped upwards, <i>Bhīmasena</i> hurled his mace at the thighs of <i>Duryodhana</i> and fractured them. Portents appeared; showers of blood and showers of dust were poured by <i>Indra</i>; a loud noise was made by Y., Rā., and Pś. (description of the portents); the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were filled with anxiety; D., G., Si., and Cā. went away (IX, <b>58</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Somakas</i> rejoiced; <i>Bhīmasena</i> rebuked <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i>, and touched his head with his left foot, which was censured by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who grieved for <i>Duryodhana</i> (σ) (IX, <b>59</b>); <i>Baladeva's</i> wrath was excited upon seeing <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> struck below the navel; he rushed on to slay <i>Bhīma</i>, but was seized and pacified by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (τ). <i>Baladeva</i> praised <i>Duryodhana</i> and cursed <i>Bhīmasena</i>, and then ascended his chariot and proceeded towards <i>Dvārakā</i>. The <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (υ), became dejected; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena</i>, etc., and <i>Duryodhana</i> spoke about what had passed (IX, <b>80</b>) (<i>Kṛṣṇa</i> asking the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> warriors to forbear insulting <i>Duryodhana; Duryodhana's</i> angry reply to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, charging him with every unfair act in course of the battle; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> reminded <i>Duryodhana</i> of his own evil acts, and referred to his miserable end as the inevitable consequence of those acts; <i>Duryodhana's</i> boast with reference to his end, which he pronounced to be most glorious) (ϕ). Celestial showers descended on <i>Duryodhana's</i> head; G., Aps., and Si. praised him. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> became ashamed; but <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> justified the use of unfair means for the slaughter of the <i>Kuru</i> warriors (χ) (IX, <b>61</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> warriors proceeded to the <i>Kuru</i> camp, which was entirely deserted (ψ); <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> caused <i>Arjuna</i> to take down the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> and his inexhaustible quivers, and then to dismount; then <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> also dismounted; the celestial ape disappeared, and the chariot (burnt by <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> with the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon), with its steeds, etc., was reduced to ashes. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> congratulated <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> on his victory, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> attributed that victory to <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> power (ω). In the encampment of the <i>Kurus</i> they found great wealth; at <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> suggestion the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i> resolved to pass the night at a spot outside the camp, on the banks of the <i>Oghavatī</i>. They then dispatched <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to <i>Hāstinapura</i> in order to pacify the wrath of <i>Gāndhārī</i>, and to comfort her and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>. He set out with <i>Dāruka</i> upon his chariot, yoked with <i>Śaibya</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i> (IX, <b>62</b>). Asked by <i>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana</i> said that the reason why <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> sent <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to <i>Hāstinapura</i> was his fear that <i>Gāndhārī</i>, by means of her ascetic merit, should reduce the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to ashes, because <i>Duryodhana</i> had been slain unfairly (αα); “<i>Vyāsa</i> will be there.” <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> caused <i>Dāruka</i> to equip his chariot, and quickly set out for <i>Hāstinapura</i>. He arrived at <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> palace, where <i>Vyāsa</i> had arrived before him; he comforted <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (ββ) and <i>Gāndhārī</i> (γγ), who said that her heart had again become steady (δδ). Then <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came to know the evil that was meditated by <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, and suddenly took leave, requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and <i>Gāndhārī</i> to protect the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and proceeded with <i>Dāruka. Vyāsa</i> comforted <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Kṛṣṇa</i> arrived at the camp and informed the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (IX, <b>63</b>). Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, <i>Sañjaya</i> narrated the lamentations of <i>Duryodhana</i> while lying on the field with his thighs broken (εε); he thought himself happy, and asked <i>Sañjaya</i> to bring his message to his parents and to <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (ζζ) (“you should never place any confidence in the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>”), and took leave of the messagebearers (εε); he was confident that <i>Cārvāka</i>, the mendicant devotee, would avenge his death. Thousands of men, with eyes full of tears, fled away; the earth trembled, etc. The messengers went and informed <i>Aśvatthāman</i> and then went away (IX, <b>64</b>). <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (ζζ), came to <i>Duryodhana</i>, who lay surrounded by carnivorous animals, etc. <i>Aśvatthā-</i> <i>man's</i> lament and <i>Duryodhana's</i> reply (ηη); <i>Aśvatthāman</i> vowed to slay all the <i>Pāñcālas; Duryodhana</i> let <i>Kṛpa</i> install <i>Aśvatthāman</i> as the <i>Kuru</i> generalissimo; then they took leave of <i>Duryodhana</i> and left him alone (IX, <b>65</b>)."
