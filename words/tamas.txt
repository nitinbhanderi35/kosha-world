It is through the union of these three qualities that the inner soul enters the life of all animate and inanimate objects. The attributes of Tamas are greed, sleep, bravery, cruelty disbelief in god, bad habits, begging and indifference. It is because of the action of tamoguṇa that one becomes a prey to lust. It is the worst result of tāmasic activities that people are born as inanimate objects, worms, insects, fishes, serpents, tortoises, cows and deer. As a better result of Tāmasic activities people are born as elephants, horses, Śūdras, barbarous people, lions, tigers and hogs. It is the good result of tāmasic deeds that produce pilgrims, good castes, egoistic people, demons and devils. (Chapter 2, Manusmṛti)."
