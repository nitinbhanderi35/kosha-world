Sunābha was the younger brother of Vajranābha. Sunābha had two daughters called Candrāvatī and Guṇavatī. These girls once saw Pradyumna and Prabhāvatī engaged in love-talk and they were attracted by Pradyumna. They requested Prabhāvatī to select husbands for them also from among the Yādavas. Prabhāvatī, in her childhood had learnt from Durvāsas a mantra, the repetition of which by a woman thinking in mind of any male would help to secure that male as the husband for her. Prabhāvatī taught that mantra to Candrāvatī and Guṇavatī. They thought respectively of Gada and Sāmba and repeated the mantra with the result that Gada married Candrāvatī and Sāmba married Guṇavatī."
