Living within the waters he roamed through all the worlds with the speed of mind. Once, unseen by Ra., he thought: “there is none equal to me”; Pś. said to him that even the celebrated <i>Tulādhāra</i> (engaged in buying and selling) was not worthy of saying such words. Ṛ. wished to see <i>Tulādhāra</i>; Ra. raised him from the sea and showed him the road. Arrived at <i>Vārāṇasī</i>, he met <i>Tulādhāra</i> and spoke to him thus(!). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> described those difficult feats that <i>Jājali</i> had performed before; while he stood as a wooden post rapt in <i>yoga</i>, a pair of <i>kuliṅga</i> birds (<i>caṭakān</i>, v. 9317) built their nest on his head, laid their eggs there, their young ones came out, and only when the latter did not come back, even after a month, <i>Jājali</i> left that spot. Then he began to slap his armpits and proclaim loudly: “I have won great merit.” Then an invisible voice in the sky said: “Thou art not equal to the wise <i>Tulādhāra</i> at <i>Vārāṇasī</i>; even he is not fit to say what thou sayest.” <i>Jājali</i>, filled with wrath and desirous of meeting with <i>Tulādhāra</i>, began to roam over the whole earth, observing the vow of silence and passing the night at that spot where evening overtook him. After a considerable time he reached <i>Vārāṇasī</i> and saw <i>Tulādhāra</i> engaged in selling miscellaneous articles (<i>paṇyāni). Tulā-</i> <i>dhāra</i> stood up and saluted him, mentioning his dealings with the birds, etc. (XII, <b>262</b>). Asked by <i>Jājali</i>, the <i>vaiśya</i> <i>Tulādhāra</i> discoursed to him upon the ways of morality; “in every creature that is endued with the five senses live all the deities, <i>Sūrya</i>, etc. (α); the goat is <i>Agni</i>; the sheep is <i>Varuṇa</i>; the horse is <i>Sūrya</i>; Earth is <i>Virāj</i>; the cow and the calf are <i>Soma</i>; the man that sells these can never obtain success…In days of yore many Ṛ. (and <i>Yatis</i>) rebuked <i>Nahuṣa</i> for having slain a cow (which is declared in the scriptures to be like unto one's mother) and a bull (which is declared to be like to the Creator himself); in order to purify <i>Nahuṣa</i>, however, they divided that sin in 101 parts, and converting the fragments into diseases, threw them among all creatures, but declared that they should not be able to pour libations in his sacrifice” (XIII, <b>263</b>). <i>Jājali</i> said that <i>Tulādhāra's</i> doctrines smacked of atheism, which the latter denied, discoursing on sacrifice, saying that brahmans, having given up the sacrifice ordained for them (i.e. Yoga), had betaken themselves to the performance of sacrifices that are for <i>kṣatriyas</i> (i.e. all other sacrifices). “Instead of all animals the rice-ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices; all rivers are as sacred as the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, and all mountains are sacred; the soul is itself a <i>tīrtha</i>; do not wander about on the earth to visit sacred places” (XII, <b>264</b>). <i>Tulādhāra</i> caused <i>Jājali</i> to summon the birds that had been reared by the latter; they made answer agreeably to the religion of <i>ahiṃsā</i> (Nīl.). “Faith is the daughter of <i>Sūrya</i>, etc.,” quoting a verse sung by <i>Brahmán</i>, exalting Faith; “the food of a liberal usurer is acceptable, but not the food of a miser; …want of faith is a high sin; faith is a cleanser of sins.” After a short while, <i>Tulādhāra</i> and <i>Jājali</i> both ascended to heaven. Many truths of this kind were spoken of by <i>Tulādhāra; Jājali</i>, having heard his words, betook himself to tranquillity (XII, <b>265</b>)."
