Beautiful Menā was the daughter of Mahāmeru. <dvsn n='NI'/>Himavān lord of the mountains and the seat of many minerals and fossils had two daughters of unparallelled beauty and their mother was the lovely Menā, daughter of Mahāmeru and wife of Himavān. (Sarga 35, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Rāmāyaṇa states that Menā had two daughters of extraordinary beauty named Gaṅgā and Umā. They were both married by Śiva. <dvsn n='NI'/>But Vāmana Purāṇa in chapter 51 states that Menā had three beautiful daughters and a son named Sunābha. Menā's first daughter was Rāgiṇī with red body and eyes and wearing a red dress. Her second daughter named Kuṭilā was white in colour, had lotus eyes, and wore white dress. The third was a girl of enchanting beauty named Kālī. She was blue-black in colour with eyes like the blue lotus leaf. <dvsn n='NI'/>It can be surmised that the Umā of Rāmāyaṇa and Kālī were one and the same person by the following verse in the Amarakośa. <Poem>Umā Kātyāyanī Gaurī Kālī Haimavatīśvarī //</Poem> <dvsn n='NI'/>When the statements of the two Purāṇas are taken together Menā should have had four daughters, Gaṅgā, Rāgiṇī, Kuṭilā and Kālī and a son named Sunābha."

Anagnis are called Agniṣvāttas and Sāgnis are called Barhiṣadas. Svadhā was the common wife of all the Pitṛs. Svadhā got two daughters, Menā and Dhāriṇī. They were both very welllearned, virtuous girls and were Brahmavādinīs (expounders of Vedānta philosophy). (Chapter 10, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa)."
