            "content": "excess of contact, which to a certain extent spoils the pronunciation and leads to.a fault. अतिस्पर्श is the same as दुःस्पर्श, the letter ळ being called दुःस्पृष्ट on account of excess of contact. This excess of contact (अतिस्पर्श) in the case of the utterance of the letter र् results into a fault as it practically borders on stammering; cf. अतिस्पर्शो बर्बरता च रेफे, R. Pr. XIV. 26."
