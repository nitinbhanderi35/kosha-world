His father, desiring to perform a sacrifice, ordered him to collect the articles, and he set out riding in a car drawn by a young ass, that bore away the car to its mother; <i>Mataṅga</i> repeatedly struck the animal with his goad on its nose; but the old she-ass consoled it, saying, “A <i>Cāṇḍāla</i> it is that is driving thee; there is no severity in a brahman.” Asked by <i>Mataṅga</i>, the she-ass revealed to him that his father was a <i>Śūdra</i> following the profession of a barber, who begat him upon a brahman woman excited with desire; “thou art, therefore, a <i>Cāṇḍāla</i> by birth.” <i>Mataṅga</i> returned home, told his father what he had heard, retired to the forest, and began to undergo the austerest penances in order to acquire the status of a brahman, so that he scorched the very deities. <i>Indra</i> came and offered him boons, but the status of a brahman, he said, could not be won by penances (XIII, <b>27</b>). <i>Mataṅga</i> then stood for 100 years on one foot. <i>Indra</i> came once more and said: “From the order of brute life one attains to the state of humanity; if born as a human being, one is sure to take birth as a <i>Pukkaśa</i> or a <i>Cāṇḍāla</i>; after 1,000 years one attains to the status of a <i>Śūdra</i>; then after 30,000 years that of a <i>Vaiśya</i>; after a period that is sixty times longer, that of a <i>kṣatriya</i>; after a period that is sixty times longer than this, to that of a fallen <i>brahman</i>; after a period 200 times as long, to that of a brahman living by the profession of arms; after a period 300 times as long, to that of a brahman reciting the <i>Gāyatrī</i> and sacred <i>mantras</i>; after a period 400 times as long, to that of a brahman conversant with the entire <i>Vedas</i> and the scriptures” (XIII, <b>28</b>). <i>Mataṅga</i> then practised austerer penances, standing on one foot for 1,000 years in <i>yoga</i>-meditation. <i>Indra</i> once more came and said the same. <i>Mataṅga</i> then repaired to <i>Gayā</i>, and there passed 300 years on one foot in <i>yoga</i>, and was reduced to only skin and bones, and dropped down on the ground from sheer exhaustion. <i>Indra</i> came quickly; now <i>Mataṅga</i> accepted the boons that he should be celebrated as <i>chandodeva</i>, and obtain the worship of all women, and his fame should become unrivalled in the three worlds (XII, <b>29</b>)."
