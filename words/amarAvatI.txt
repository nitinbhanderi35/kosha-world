Its location is described in Devī Bhāgavata as follows: “Brahmā's world extends over 10,000 yojanas on the Mahāmeru mountain. There are eight cities— each 2,500 square yojanas in extent—of the Aṣṭadikpālakas in eight parts of this Brahmapurī. Thus there are nine cities on the top of the Mahā Meru. They are the following:— <dvsn n='NI'/>1. In the centre is Brahmā's city, Manovatī. <dvsn n='NI'/>2. To the east of Manovatī, Indra's city, Amarāvatī. <dvsn n='NI'/>3.
