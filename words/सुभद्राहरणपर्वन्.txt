Subhadrāharaṇa.) § 252: Some days afterwards a mountain festival of the <i>Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis</i>, and <i>Andhakas</i> was held on the <i>Raivataka</i> mountain; there <i>Haladhara</i> (i.e. Balarāma) with <i>Revatī</i>, followed by <i>Gandharvas</i>, king <i>Ugrasena</i>, with his 1000 wives, <i>Raukmiṇeya, Śāmba, Akrūra, Sāraṇa</i>, <i>Gada, Babhru, Vidūratha, Niśaṭha, Cārudeṣṇa, Pṛthu, Vipṛthu</i>, <i>Satyaka, Sātyaki, Bhaṅgakāra, Mahārava, Hārdikya, Uddhava</i>, etc., were present; <i>Arjuna</i> fell in love with <i>Subhadrā</i>, the favourite daughter of <i>Vasudeva</i>, the sister of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and uterine sister of <i>Sāraṇa. Kṛṣṇa</i> told him to carry her away by force, as the result of a <i>svayaṃvara</i> was doubtful. They sent a courier to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> at <i>Indraprastha</i>, and obtained his assent (I, <b>219</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> set out as for a hunting expedition in his chariot, yoked with <i>Śaibya</i> and <i>Sugrīva</i>, and carried away <i>Subhadrā</i> towards <i>Indraprastha</i>. The soldiers ran to <i>Dvārakā</i> to the <i>sabhā</i>, named <i>Sudharmā</i>, and informed the <i>sābhāpāla</i>, who, by blowing the drum of alarm (<i>bherīṃ</i> <i>sānnāhikīṃ</i>) caused the <i>Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas</i>, and <i>Bhojas</i> to assemble at the <i>sabhā</i>. While they made a loud uproar, <i>Baladeva</i> restored silence by saying that they ought first to hear what <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> purposed. Then, seeing <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> sitting silent, he spoke angrily about this deed of <i>Arjuna</i> (I, <b>220</b>)."
