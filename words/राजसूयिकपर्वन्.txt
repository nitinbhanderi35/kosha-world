Rājasūyikaṃ parva.) § 286: Under <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> rule the people were very happy, and great riches filled the treasury. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> resolved upon the celebration of the <i>rājasūya. Kṛṣṇa</i> came there, having appointed <i>Ānakadundubhi</i> to the command of the army. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, sitting with <i>Dhaumya, Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana</i>, his brothers, etc., asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to install himself in that sacrifice or to permit the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to be installed in it. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> ought to perform it and employ himself (i.e. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>) in some office. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> caused his minister (<i>mantrin) Sahadeva</i> to get the articles together that <i>Dhaumya</i> might order as required for the sacrifice, and to let <i>Indrasena</i> and <i>Viśoka</i> and <i>Puru</i>, with <i>Arjuna</i> for his charioteer, engage in collecting food. <i>Dvaipāyana</i> himself became the <i>brahman</i> and appointed learned brahmans as <i>ṛtvijes; Susāman</i> (“the bull of the <i>Dhanañjayas</i>”) became the <i>sāmaga, Yājñavalkya</i> the <i>adhvaryu, Paila</i> (the son of <i>Vasu</i>) the <i>hotṛ</i> accompanied by <i>Dhaumya</i>, and their disciples and sons the <i>hotragas</i> (see BR.) who uttered benedictions, etc. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> caused <i>Sahadeva</i> to dispatch messengers, who invited men of the four castes. Then the brahmans installed (<i>dīkṣayāñ cakrire) Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in the <i>rājasūya</i> sacrifice, the guests arrived, the artificers erected habitations, etc. Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> despatched <i>Nakula</i> to <i>Hāstinapura</i> in order to fetch <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura</i>, <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc. (II, <b>33</b>).

Śiśupālavadhaparvan): Then the sacrifice was completed, watched by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. When the kings departed, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, commanded by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, followed them to the confines of his dominions, one after another (α). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> asked leave to go to <i>Dvārakā</i>, being thanked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> for his co-operation, and having bidden farewell to <i>Pṛthā</i>, etc. (β), and having performed his ablutions, etc., he walked round the <i>Garuḍa-</i>bannered chariot, which <i>Dāruka</i> had fetched, and ascending it set out for <i>Dvāravatī</i>, followed on foot by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, till they took leave. Now <i>Duryodhana</i> alone, with king <i>Subala's</i> son <i>Śakuni</i>, remained in the assembly house (II, <b>45</b>)."
