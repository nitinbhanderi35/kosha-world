Generally Hari is derived from § <i>hṛ’</i> to take away or remove evil or sin.<sup>23</sup> The second part <i>‘trāta’</i> means ‘protected’. Thus the whole literally means ‘protected by Hari’.<sup>24</sup> Haritrāta was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of the <i>Catur-</i> <i>vedins</i> of the locality called Padmā in the town named Indrapura."
