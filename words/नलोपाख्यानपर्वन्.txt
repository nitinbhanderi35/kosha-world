Nalopākhyāna).—§ 343: One day, when the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were grieving for <i>Arjuna, Bhīma</i> asked <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to permit him to go and slay <i>Duryodhana</i>, interpreting the time to be complete (“as in the <i>Veda</i> a day is often equivalent to a year, when passed in suffering”) (<i>kṛcchrataḥ</i>), but he did not prevail upon <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. While they were conversing the great <i>ṛṣi Bṛhadaśva</i> came before them, and, asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> if there was on earth a king more unfortunate than himself, he said that he would narrate a history of a prince more miserable than <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, viz. <i>Nala</i> (the son of the <i>Niṣadha</i> king <i>Vīrasena</i>), who, defeated deceitfully by <i>Puṣkara</i> (the brother of <i>Nala</i>, v. 2296), dwelt in the woods with his spouse, having neither slaves nor chariots nor brothers nor friends with him (III, <b>52</b>).— § 344: <i>Bṛhadaśva</i> said: The <i>Niṣadha</i> king <i>Nala</i>, the son of <i>Vīrasena</i>, was above all kings, etc., and fond of dice. The <i>Vidarbha</i> king <i>Bhīma</i> was granted by the <i>Brahmarṣi</i> <i>Damana</i> a daughter, <i>Damayantī</i>, and three excellent sons, <i>Dama, Dānta</i>, and <i>Damana</i>. Both <i>Nala</i> and <i>Damayantī</i> had not their equals in beauty, and, continually hearing of each other's virtues, they conceived attachment to each other, though they had never seen each other. Once <i>Nala</i> in his garden saw a number of golden-winged swans and caught one of them, but let it loose, as it promised to speak well of him before <i>Damayantī</i>. The swans having arrived at the <i>Vidarbha</i> country, the one who had been caught by <i>Nala</i> led <i>Damayantī</i> to a secluded spot and fulfilled its mission. <i>Damayantī</i> caused it to speak to <i>Nala</i> of her (III, <b>53</b>).—§ 345: As <i>Damayantī</i> became sick of love, her father invited all the kings to her <i>svayaṃvara</i>. At this time the <i>ṛṣis</i> of the gods <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Parvata</i>, having arrived in course of their wanderings at the regions of <i>Indra</i>, told him that the kings did not now come to him because they were intent on the <i>svayaṃvara</i> of <i>Damayantī</i>. Hearing this, the <i>Lokapālas</i> set out on their vehicles for the <i>svayaṃvara</i>, but seeing <i>Nala</i> on the way and filled with astonishment at his beauty, they left their chariots in the sky and asked <i>Nala</i> to be their messenger (III, <b>54</b>). <i>Nala</i> promised to do so, but when <i>Indra</i> told him to go to <i>Damayantī</i> and tell her that <i>Indra, Agni, Varuṇa</i>, and <i>Yama</i> desired her to choose one of them for her lord, he asked them to spare him as he had come with the same object; but, as they insisted that he should stand by his promise, he by their power entered without being perceived by the guardians into the apartments of <i>Damayantī</i>, and, saying his name, fulfilled his mission (III, <b>55</b>). <i>Damayantī</i> declared that if she did not become the wife of <i>Nala</i> himself she would resort to poison, or fire, or water, or the rope. <i>Nala</i> advised her to choose one of the gods, maintaining that having come in a different mission he dared not seek his own interest. <i>Damayantī</i> then told him to come to her <i>svayaṃvara</i> in company with the gods, then she would choose him, at which no blame would be his, and <i>Nala</i> returned to the <i>Lokapālas</i> and told them what had happened (III, <b>56</b>). At the sacred hour of the holy lunar day of the auspicious season <i>Bhīma</i> summoned the kings to the <i>svayaṃvara</i>, and that assembly of kings resembled the <i>Bhogavatī</i> swarming with <i>Nāgas. Damayantī</i>, beholding five persons all alike in appearance, and recollecting the marks of the celestials, of which she had heard from old people, was unable to distinguish which of them was <i>Nala</i>. Filled with grief, she then decided upon seeking the protection of the gods themselves, and prevailed upon them that they assumed their true shapes. Thereupon she beheld the gods unmoistened with perspiration, with unwinking eyes and unfading garlands, not stained with dust, and staying without touching the ground, while <i>Nala</i> was revealed by his shadow, his fading garlands, and by his being stained with dust and sweat, and resting on the ground with winking eyes. She then chose <i>Nala</i>, seizing the hem of his garment and placing a floral wreath round his neck. <i>Nala</i> promised <i>Damayantī</i> that he would remain hers as long as he lived, and she spoke words of like import to him. The <i>Lokapālas</i> bestowed each a couple of boons on <i>Nala: Indra</i>, that he should be able to behold his divine nature in sacrifices, and blessed regions thereafter (<i>gatim anuttamāṃ); Agni</i>, his own presence wherever he wished and regions as bright as himself; <i>Yama</i>, subtle taste in food and pre-eminence in virtue; <i>Varuṇa</i>, water wherever he desired and garlands of celestial fragrance. Then the gods went to heaven and the kings returned home. <i>Nala</i>, after the wedding, stayed there for a time, returned home, ruled righteously, and celebrated the horsesacrifice, etc. He begat the son <i>Indrasena</i> and the daughter <i>Indrasenā</i> upon <i>Damayantī</i> (III, <b>57</b>).—§ 346: When the <i>Lokapālas</i> were returning they met <i>Dvāpara</i> with <i>Kali</i> going to the <i>svayaṃvara</i>, and <i>Indra</i> told <i>Kali</i> that <i>Damayantī</i> had already chosen <i>Nala</i>. As <i>Kali</i> threatened to avenge himself he was rebuked by the <i>Lokapālas</i>, as <i>Nala</i> had studied the four <i>Vedas</i> with the <i>Ākhyāna</i> as the fifth, etc. When the gods had gone to heaven, <i>Kali</i> said that he would take possession of <i>Nala</i> and deprive him of his kingdom, and asked <i>Dvāpara</i> to enter the dice (III, <b>58</b>). <i>Kali</i> then went to the country of the <i>Niṣadhas</i> and always watched for an opportunity. At last, in the twelfth year, when <i>Nala</i>, after answering a call of nature, touching water had said his twilight prayers without having washed his feet, <i>Kali</i> entered his person. Then <i>Kali</i> becoming <i>Vṛṣa</i> (<i>“vṛṣo gavāṃ,”</i> the principal die, Nīl.) (PCR. thinks we ought to read that “<i>Dvāpara</i> also approached <i>Puṣkara</i> becoming <i>Vṛṣa</i>”) prevailed upon <i>Puṣkara</i>, that he challenged <i>Nala</i> to a match of dice in order to acquire his kingdom. <i>Nala</i> and <i>Puṣkara</i> gambled together for many months, <i>Nala</i> being always worsted; no one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading him from the play; at last they came in a body, which was told by the <i>sūta</i> to <i>Damayantī</i>, who in vain represented it to <i>Nala</i>; he uttered not a word in reply (III, <b>59</b>). Seeing that <i>Nala</i> had lost everything, <i>Damayantī</i> told her nurse and maidservant <i>Bṛhatsenā</i> to summon the councillors in the name of <i>Nala</i> and tell them what had been lost; the councillors approached <i>Nala</i>, and <i>Damayantī</i> informed him that the citizens had come again in a body, but he regarded her not. She then caused <i>Bṛhatsenā</i> to summon the <i>sūta Vārṣṇeya</i>, who at her request yoked <i>Nala's</i> favourite horses and brought her two children to <i>Kuṇḍina</i> (the city of <i>Bhīma</i>, Nīl.). There he left the children, the chariot, and the horses, and went to <i>Ayodhyā</i>, where he entered the service of king <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> (the king of <i>Kośala</i>, v. 2877) as a charioteer (III, <b>60</b>).—§ 347: At last, when <i>Puṣkara</i> had won all <i>Nala's</i> wealth and his kingdom, he proposed to him to stake <i>Damayantī</i>. But <i>Nala</i>, feeling as if his heart would burst and gazing at <i>Puṣkara</i> in anguish without speaking a word, took all the ornaments off his body, and attired in a single piece of cloth left the city accompanied by <i>Damayantī</i>. They stayed for three nights in the outskirts of the city, living on water alone. Nobody showed him hospitable regards, as <i>Puṣkara</i> had proclaimed through the city that he that should show any attention to <i>Nala</i> would be put to death. After many days <i>Nala</i> saw some birds of golden hue and covered them with his cloth in order to catch them, but they rose up to the sky taking away that garment of his, and then told him they were the dice that had come hither to take away even his cloth. <i>Nala</i> proposed to <i>Damayantī</i> to leave him, pointing out to her the roads to <i>Avantī, Ṛkṣavat</i>, <i>Vindhya, Payoṣnī, Vidarbha, Kośala</i> (C. <i>Kośalāṃ</i>, B. and Bopp <i>Kośalān</i>), and the south. But she would not leave him, but suggested that they should go to <i>Vidarbha</i> (III, <b>61</b>). <i>Nala</i> refused to appear before <i>Bhīma</i> in his state of misery. They went on attired in the same piece of cloth. Once when <i>Damayantī</i> had fallen into a profound slumber in a shed for travellers (<i>sabhā), Nala</i>, influenced by <i>Kali</i>, resolved upon deserting <i>Damayantī</i>, as separated from him she might perchance wander to her relatives. With a sword that he found near the shed he cut off one half of the cloth and throwing the instrument away departed, having first returned again and again, dragged away by <i>Kali</i>, but drawn back by love (III, <b>62</b>). When <i>Damayantī</i> awoke, she lamented and cursed the being through whose imprecation <i>Nala</i> suffered woe, saying that it should lead a still more miserable life. Thereupon, wandering on, she was seized by a gigantic serpent and rescued by a hunter; as the hunter, after comforting her, tried to force her to love him, he was cursed by her and fell down lifeless upon the ground (III, <b>63</b>). Description of the forest, <i>Damayantī's</i> lamentations. She went in a northerly direction for three days and nights, then she came to an asylum of ascetics, who told her that she should again become happy together with <i>Nala</i>. Then the asylum disappeared. Sometime afterwards, having proceeded a long way, she met with a body of merchants landing on the banks of a river; its leader was <i>Śuci</i> (v. 2529, “so help us now, <i>Maṇibhadra</i>, the king of <i>Yakṣas</i>”), and it was bound for the city of the <i>Cedi</i> king <i>Subāhu</i> (III, <b>64</b>). <i>Damayantī</i> followed the caravan. Once, at midnight, the caravan was destroyed by wild elephants and many men were trodden to death, which some ascribed to their not having worshipped <i>Maṇibhadra</i> or <i>Vaiśvavaṇa</i>, the kings of <i>Yakṣas</i>, others to their having received <i>Damayantī</i>, whom they thought to be a <i>Rākṣasa</i> or <i>Piśāca</i> or <i>Yakṣa</i> woman, and resolved upon killing her when they saw her. Hearing this <i>Damayantī</i> fled. The next day the remnant of the caravan left the place. <i>Damayantī</i>, with the brahmans that had survived the slaughter of the caravan, came towards evening to the city of the <i>Cedi</i> king <i>Subāhu</i>. The boys began to follow her; when she came before the palace of the king, the queen-mother let the nurse take her in. <i>Damayantī</i> agreed to stay there on the conditions that she should not eat remnants, not wash anyone's feet, nor speak with other men, but be protected against all aspirations. The queen gave her as a <i>sairindhrī</i> to her daughter <i>Sunandā</i> (III, <b>65</b>).—§ 348: <i>Nala</i>, having deserted <i>Damayantī</i>, saw a conflagration in the forest and therefrom heard a voice calling him by name and saw the <i>Nāga Karkoṭaka</i>, who unable to stir, told him that he had deceived the great ṛṣi <i>Nārada</i> and been cursed by him with the words: “Stay thou here immobile until <i>Nala</i> takes thee hence, then thou shalt be freed from my curse,” and asked him to deliver him and promised to instruct him in respect of his welfare. The snake then became as small as a thumb, and <i>Nala</i> taking him up went to a spot free from fire. <i>Karkoṭaka</i> let him proceed yet counting his steps, and bit him at the tenth step (<i>adaśad daśame pade</i>) (see Nīl. and PCR.). Then the form of <i>Nala</i> was changed, in order that people might not recognize him, and <i>Karkoṭaka</i> assumed his own form, and said that <i>Kali</i> dwelling in <i>Nala</i> should be tortured by his venom, and that <i>Nala</i> should have no fear from animals with fangs, from enemies, and from men versed in the Veda (<i>brahmavidbhyaḥ</i>), and told him to go to <i>Ayodhyā</i> and present himself as a <i>sūta Bāhuka</i> before <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> (of the race of <i>Ikṣvāku</i>), who would give <i>Nala</i> his skill in dice (<i>akṣahṛdaya</i>) in exchange for <i>Nala's</i> knowledge of horses (<i>aśvahṛdaya</i>), and when he had become an adept at dice he should have prosperity and meet with his wife and children and regain his kingdom. The <i>Nāga</i> king then gave <i>Nala</i> two pieces of celestial cloth, saying that when he desired to get back his own form he should remember him and wear this garment. Then he disappeared (III, <b>66</b>).—§ 349: On the tenth day <i>Nala</i> entered the city of <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i>; he approached the king and named himself <i>Bāhuka</i>, and said that he surpassed everybody in managing steeds and might be consulted in matters of difficulty (<i>arthakṛcchreṣu</i>) and affairs of skill (<i>naipuṇeṣu</i>), and that he was versed in the art of cooking. Then he was appointed superintendent of <i>Ṛtuparṇa's</i> horses on a pay of 10,000, and <i>Vārṣṇeya</i> and <i>Jīvala</i> should be under his direction. Every evening he recited the śloka, “Where lies that helpless one (<i>tapasvinī</i>) afflicted with hunger and thirst and worn with toil (<i>śrāntā</i>), or upon whom does she now wait (<i>upatiṣṭhati)?</i>” Once <i>Jīvala</i> asked him who she was, and <i>Nala</i> related to him the main features of his story without naming her or himself (III, <b>67</b>).—§ 350: <i>Bhīma</i> sent out brahmans in all directions to search for <i>Nala</i> and <i>Damayantī</i>, promising 1,000 kine, etc., to him that should find them. At length the brahman <i>Sudeva</i>, the friend of <i>Damayantī's</i> brother, recognized <i>Damayantī</i> in the city of the <i>Cedis</i>, seated with <i>Sunandā</i> during the time of the king's prayers (<i>puṇyāhavācane rājñaḥ</i>), and told her who he was and that her relatives and children were well. Beholding <i>Damayantī</i> weeping and conversing in private with <i>Sudeva, Sunandā</i> caused her mother to question <i>Sudeva</i> (III, <b>68</b>). <i>Sudeva</i> told the story of <i>Damayantī</i>, and that he had recognized her by a mole between her eyebrows, which was now almost covered with dust as her whole body. Then <i>Sunandā</i> washed away the dust and the queen-mother recognized her by the mole as the daughter of her sister, as she and <i>Damayantī's</i> mother were both daughters of the <i>Daśārṇa</i> king <i>Sudāman</i>, and she herself had been bestowed on <i>Vīrabāhu</i> and her sister on <i>Bhīma</i>; she had witnessed <i>Damayantī's</i> birth in the palace of her father in the Daśārṇa country. At her own request <i>Damayantī</i> was brought in a litter carried by men and protected by a large escort to the city of <i>Bhīma</i>, and was received with respect and worshipped the gods and brahmans. <i>Bhīma</i> gave unto <i>Sudeva</i> 1,000 kine, etc. The next day <i>Damayantī</i> let her mother cause <i>Bhīma</i> to send brahmans out in all directions to seek for <i>Nala. Damayantī</i> ordered them everywhere to recite the <i>ślokas</i>: “O beloved gambler, where hast thou gone, cutting off half of my garment,” etc., but to take care that no one knew that it was on her command (III, <b>69</b>).—§ 351: After a long time the brahman <i>Parṇāda</i> told that he had in <i>Ayodhyā</i> visited <i>Bhāṅgāsuri</i> (i.e. <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i>), and that <i>Bāhuka</i> had been affected by hearing his <i>śloka</i>, and had said to him: “Chaste women, though overtaken by calamity, yet protect themselves,” etc. <i>Damayantī</i> then thanked <i>Parṇāda</i> and promised him great wealth and consulted with her mother, and, without <i>Bhīma's</i> knowing it, sent <i>Sudeva</i>, who told <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> that to-morrow <i>Damayantī</i> would hold another <i>svayaṃvara</i> (III, <b>70</b>). When ordered by <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> to conduct him to the <i>svayaṃvara</i> of <i>Damayantī, Bāhuka</i> felt his heart bursting with grief, but promised to go there in a single day; he yoked four horses born in <i>Sindhu</i> (description of their marks), made <i>Vārṣṇeya</i> sit on the chariot, and set out with so great speed that <i>Vārṣṇeya</i> thought he must be <i>Mātali</i> or <i>Śālihotra</i>, who had taken a human shape, or <i>Nala</i> (III, <b>71</b>).—§ 352: As the chariot was coursing thus, <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> lost his upper garment, and <i>Nala</i> declared that it was impossible to recover it, as they had already travelled one <i>yojana</i> thence. As <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> rightly indicated the number of fruits of a <i>vibhītaka-</i>tree (<i>Terminalia bellerica</i>), and said he was skilled in dice as in numbers, <i>Nala</i> prevailed upon him to teach him the science and in future receive instead his science of horses. Then <i>Kali</i> came out from the body of <i>Nala</i>, vomiting the poison of <i>Karkoṭaka</i>, and assumed his own shape, as the fire of <i>Damayantī's</i> curse had left him, but remained invisible to others except <i>Nala. Kali</i> prevailed upon <i>Nala</i> that he should not curse him, promising that those men who would attentively recite his history should be free from fear of him, and entered the <i>vibhītaka-</i>tree till <i>Nala</i> had gone far away. Then <i>Kali</i> returned to his abode. From the touch of <i>Kali</i> the <i>vibhītaka-</i>tree from that hour fell into disrepute. <i>Nala</i> now became free from calamity, though he did not assume his original form (III, <b>72</b>).— § 353: At night they arrived at <i>Kuṇḍina</i>, having passed 100 <i>yojanas</i>. The steeds of <i>Nala</i> that were in that city, and peacocks and elephants and <i>Damayantī</i> recognized the sound of <i>Nala's</i> chariot; <i>Damayantī</i> ascended the terrace with the desire of seeing <i>Nala</i>. The <i>Kośala</i> king (<i>Ṛtuparṇa</i>) wondered, as he did not hear any talk of the <i>svayaṃvara</i>, etc., and <i>Bhīma</i> thought that he had come simply to pay his respects. When <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> had gone to his appointed quarters with <i>Vārṣṇeya</i>, and <i>Bāhuka</i>, having tended the horses, was sitting at the side of the chariot, <i>Damayantī</i> sent a female messenger in search of <i>Nala</i> (III, <b>73</b>). The female messenger <i>Keśinī</i> asked <i>Bāhuka</i> about <i>Vārṣṇeya</i> and himself; he said that <i>Vārṣṇeya</i> was the charioteer of <i>Nala</i>, that nobody knew <i>Nala</i> except <i>Nala</i> himself and his wife, as he did not discover his marks of identity anywhere, and that he himself was the charioteer and cook of king <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i>; at last she repeated the <i>śloka</i> of <i>Parṇāda</i>: “O beloved gambler,” etc., and said that <i>Damayantī</i> wished again to hear the reply he had given <i>Parṇāda</i>; then <i>Bāhuka</i>, weeping, said: “Chaste women, though overtaken by calamity,” etc., and <i>Keśinī</i> went to <i>Damayantī</i> and acquainted her with everything (III, <b>74</b>). <i>Damayantī</i> again sent <i>Keśinī</i> to stay in silence at <i>Bāhuka's</i> side and mark his conduct; she related that low passages grew in height so that he might pass through them easily, that when he approached narrow holes opened wide, that only by his looking upon them the vessels became filled with water, that when he held a handful of grass in the sun the fire blazed up all of a sudden, that he touched fire and was not hurt, that water falling at his will flowed in a stream, and that flowers pressed with his hands became gayer and more fragrant than before. <i>Damayantī</i> then caused <i>Keśinī</i> without <i>Bāhuka's</i> knowledge to bring her some meat that had been boiled and dressed by him, from the kitchen, and recognized the taste. She then sent her two children with <i>Keśinī. Bāhuka</i> embraced them crying aloud, saying they were like his own children, and sent <i>Keśinī</i> away lest people might think “evil” (III, <b>75</b>). Having obtained the consent both of her father and mother, <i>Damayantī</i> caused <i>Nala</i> to be brought to her apartments; it came to an explication; <i>Damayantī</i> declared that she had feigned to hold a second <i>svayaṃvara</i> because no one except <i>Nala</i> could in one day manage 100 <i>yojanas</i> with horses, and swore by the Air, Sun, and Moon (“who dwells as a witness within every creature,” v. 2989), who had been her protector for these three years, and <i>Vāyu</i> bore witness to the truth of her words. Then a floral shower fell there, and the celestial kettledrum began to play. <i>Nala</i> then wore the garment he had received from the serpent king and regained his old form. Thus <i>Nala</i> in the fourth year was reunited with his wife (III, <b>76</b>). The next day they presented themselves before <i>Bhīma</i>. The citizens were in great joy and adorned (<i>arcitāni</i>) the temples (<i>devatāyatanāni</i>), etc. <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> asked <i>Nala's</i> forgiveness, and <i>Nala</i> also asked <i>Ṛtuparṇa's</i> forgiveness, and made over to him his horselore, having obtained from him the mystery of dice. Then <i>Ṛtuparṇa</i> went away to his own city, employing another person as his charioteer (III, <b>77</b>).—§ 354: Having dwelt for a month at <i>Kuṇḍina, Nala</i> set out for the <i>Niṣadha</i> country with a single white chariot, sixteen elephants, fifty horses, and 600 infantry, and proposed to <i>Puṣkara</i> that they should gamble again, as <i>Nala</i> had won great wealth; the stake should be <i>Damayantī</i>, wealth and kingdom, and their lives; if not, he proposed a single combat. <i>Puṣkara</i>, hoping to win <i>Damayantī</i>, whom he loved, gladly consented to gamble, and lost at a single throw. <i>Nala</i>, declaring that it was <i>Kali</i> who had done it all, forgave his brother and granted him his portion, and after a month let him go to his own town. All the citizens and subjects rejoiced at <i>Nala's</i> return (III, <b>78</b>). Then <i>Nala</i> with a large force brought <i>Damayantī</i> and his children home, and passed his days in joy and performed numerous sacrifices with abundant gifts to brahmans.—§ 355: “So thou also, O <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, wilt blaze forth in effulgence soon. They that will repeatedly recite this history of <i>Nala</i> and they that will hear it recited will never be touched by adversity.” As <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> feared that some one skilled in dice might summon him, <i>Bṛhadaśva</i> taught him the science of dice (<i>akṣahṛdaya</i>) and then went to <i>Aśvaśiras</i> for a bathe. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> then learnt from brahmans and ascetics from various directions that <i>Arjuna</i> was still engaged in ascetic penances, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> grieved for him (III, <b>79</b>)."
