The cry of this bird resembles “MĀ SĀHASA”. <F>1) Mā Sāhasa = Do not act rashly.</F> But this bird lived by pecking at and eating the flesh between the teeth of a lion. Śiśupāla mentioned this bird as an example to illustrate that Bhīṣma's advice was at variance with his practice. The bird exhorts people not to act in a rash way (Mā Sāhasa) and at the same time acts rashly."
