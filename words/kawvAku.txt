Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa states that he was an ancestor of Ikṣvāku. <dvsn n='NI'/>In the beginning Manu, alias Vaivasvata, had a son named Kaṭvāku. He was the first of kings and he ruled the world for a long time. On the banks of the river Sarayū he constructed a city called Ayodhyā. Ayodhyā was celebrated for its beauty and wise men proclaimed that it was more beautiful than the cities of the eight guards of the universe or the city of even Brahmā, the Creator."
