Pativratāyā ākhyānaṃ). § 479 (Mārkaṇḍ.): Questioned by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> about the virtue of women, <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i>, saying that the work of a mother is more difficult than that of a father, and that for women neither sacrifices nor <i>śrāddhas</i> nor fasts are of any efficacy, but that they can win heaven only by serving their husbands (III, <b>205</b>), related: When the <i>brahman</i> <i>Kauśika</i>, who had studied the Vedas and the Upaniṣads, was reciting the Vedas under a tree, a female crane befouled his body, and looked upon with anger by <i>Kauśika</i> fell to the ground. <i>Kauśika</i> regretted his angry deed. When he had entered a village in order to procure alms, in a certain house the wife first served her husband, who came home tired and hungry, with food, etc. (description), and then began to conciliate the angry <i>Kauśika</i>, who blamed her for exalting her husband above the <i>brahmans</i>. She said that she was no she-crane, that she knew that the ocean had been made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the <i>brahmans</i>, that the fire of their wrath had not to this day been extinguished in the forest of <i>Daṇḍaka</i>, but that she regarded her husband as her supreme god, and deserved forgiveness, that anger is a foe to men within themselves, and that the gods know him to be a <i>brahman</i> who has abandoned anger and passion, etc.; and who, though himself injured, never returns the injury, etc., that virtue (<i>dharma</i>) is difficult to understand, but must be based on truth; the ancients have declared that virtue depends on <i>śruti</i>, but it is variously defined (<i>bahudhā dṛśyate</i>) and subtle to be understood (<i>sūkṣma</i>); “thou art cognisant of virtue and studiest the Vedas; but I think, however, that thou dost not know what virtue really is; a fowler (<i>vyādha</i>) in <i>Mithilā</i> will discourse to thee on virtue.” <i>Kauśika</i> blessed her, and returned to his abode, reproaching himself (III, <b>206</b>).—§ 480: He set out for <i>Mithilā</i> (description), ruled over by <i>Janaka</i>, and found out the fowler, who was seated in a butcher's yard, selling venison and buffalo meat to a large crowd of buyers; but he at once went to <i>Kauśika</i>, and proving that he knew why he had come, he led him to his abode, where he honoured him duly, and explained to him that, notwithstanding his cruel trade, which he had inherited from his sires and grandsires, and which belonged to his caste by birth, he led a virtuous life, serving his superiors and old people, speaking truth, never envying others, giving to the best of his power, etc. In the kingdom of <i>Janaka</i> there did not exist a single subject that did not follow the duties of his caste. He did not slay the boars and buffaloes himself, nor did he eat meat himself; he fasted during the day and ate in the night; “even though the behaviour of his order be bad, a person may yet be himself of good behaviour; so also a person may become virtuous, although he may by profession be a slayer of animals.” It is the fault of the kings when the subjects decay, and monsters, dwarfs, etc., are produced, but <i>Janaka</i> ruled justly. If one repents a wrong done by him, he is delivered from his sin (v. 13751). If a man seeks redemption (<i>kalyāṇam</i> <i>abhipadyate</i>) after having committed a sin, he becomes purified of all his sins (v. 13756). It is temptation (<i>lobha</i>) that constitutes the basis of sin. Then he gave some advice as to what is virtuous conduct (v. 13794 foll.: “these three are said to constitute the perfect way (<i>padaṃ</i>) of the virtuous: a man must not do wrong to anybody, he must give alms, and must always be truthful”); (v. 13797 foll.: “freedom from malice, forbearance, peace of mind, contentment, pleasant speech, renunciation of desires and anger, virtuous conduct, and actions regulated according to the ordinances of the sacred texts, constitute the perfect way (<i>mārgaṃ</i>) of the virtuous”) (III, <b>207</b>). The fowler and the animals slain by him are driven by their <i>karman</i> in a former life. In days of yore 2,000 animals and 2,000 cows used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king <i>Rantideva</i>; at the <i>cāturmāsya</i> animals are sacrificed; the <i>śruti</i> says, “The fires are fond of meat” (v. 13812), and at the sacrifices animals are killed by the regenerate, and these animals are purged of sin, and by <i>mantras</i> go to heaven. Regarding animal food this rule has been laid down by <i>munis</i>: Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully (<i>yathāvidhi yathāśrāddhaṃ</i>) to the gods and the <i>Pitṛs</i>, is not polluted by the act. The <i>śruti</i> says, “Such a man is not one who partakes of animal food,” and a <i>brahman</i> who has intercourse with his wife during her season is a <i>brahma-</i> <i>cārin</i>. King <i>Saudāsa</i>, under the influence of a curse, ate human flesh. Agriculture is considered to be praiseworthy, though the plough destroys many creatures. Seeds of rice, etc., are all living creatures. As to hunting and the cutting of trees and herbs, many creatures live in trees and fruits and water. The earth and the air are all swarming with living organisms, which are unconsciously destroyed by men from mere ignorance (III, <b>208</b>). When life is at stake and in the matter of marriage, it is justified to tell an untruth. Whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is considered to be truth (<i>satyaṃ</i>) (v. 13845; cf. v. 13990). The fowler discoursed upon the influence of <i>karman</i> upon metempsychosis and salvation (<i>mokṣa; Brahmaṇaḥ padaṃ</i>, v. 13895) (III, <b>209</b>).—§ 481: Questioned by <i>Kauśika</i> about the senses, the fowler discoursed about the sinful (in thought, word, and action (v. 13906); the evolution of sin is this: First <i>manas</i> is bent on <i>vijñāna</i>; thence successively originate <i>kāma, roṣa, karman, rāga, dveṣa, lobha, moha, vyāja</i>, <i>adharma, pāpa</i>). The virtuous man discerns these evils by means of his spiritual insight (v. 13908).—§ 482: Then he shortly enumerated the elements of the <i>brāhmī vidyā</i> (the universe, consisting of the five great elements, space, wind, fire, water, and earth, is <i>Bráhman</i> [neuter]; their qualities: sound, touch, form, flavour, and taste; <i>manas, buddhi, ahaṅ-</i> <i>kāra</i>; the five senses, <i>ātman, rajas, sattva, tamas</i>; the last seventeen are <i>“rāśir avyaktasañjñakaḥ”</i>, in all (with the objects of senses and the manifest and the unmanifest) twenty-four (<i>caturviṃśaka ity eṣa vyaktāvyaktamayo guṇaḥ</i>) [read <i>gaṇah</i>, cf. Hopkins, Great Epic, p. 34] (III, <b>210</b>).— § 483: A somewhat more detailed explanation of the five elements and their qualities. The terms <i>vyakta</i> and <i>avyakta</i> (v. 13931). Salvation, etc., are dependent on self-discipline (<i>tapas</i>), that is impossible without subduing the senses. The body is like a chariot, the coachman being the soul, and the horses the six senses (III, <b>211</b>).—§ 484: The three qualities <i>sattva, rajas</i>, and <i>tamas</i> (III, <b>212</b>).—§ 485: The five vital airs (<i>prāṇa, samāna, apāna, udāna, vyāna</i>), that are all seated (<i>pratiṣṭhitāḥ</i>, v. 13973) in the navel, and by whose collision the internal fire is generated that digests the food. The arteries (<i>nāḍyaḥ</i>), issuing from the heart in all directions, carry the essence of food (<i>annarasān</i>) acted upon by the ten <i>prāṇas</i>. The perception of the internal spirit, purification of the heart, destroys the good and evil effects of actions and leads to eternal beatitude. That state of peace and purification of heart (<i>prasādasya</i>, v. 13984) is likened to the state of a person who in a cheerful state of mind (<i>tṛptaḥ</i>) sleeps soundly (<i>sukhaṃ</i>), or to a lamp shining on a windless spot, well kindled. Community with <i>Bráhman</i> cannot be taught to us even by the <i>guru</i> (v. 13992) (III, <b>213</b>). —§ 486: Saying “Thou shalt see by what means I have attained to this blissful state”, the fowler introduced <i>Kauśika</i> to his parents, whom he honoured together with his wife and children like gods (description; v. 14025: “I do what is agreeable to them, even though it be not strictly justifiable”) (III, <b>214</b>).—The fowler said: “Thou hast wronged thy father and thy mother, for thou hast left home without their permission, for the purpose of learning the <i>Vedas</i>, and they have become blind from grief at thy loss. Thereby thy ascetic merit, etc., have become useless to thee. Do return home this very day.” <i>Kauśika</i> acknowledged that the fowler had rescued him when he was on the point of falling into hell, and that he did not consider him to be a <i>śūdra</i>, as it was very difficult for a <i>śūdra</i> to learn the eternal religion (<i>dharmaḥ</i>); his being a <i>śūdra</i> must surely be due to any action in a former birth; this <i>Kauśika</i> wished to learn.—§ 487: The fowler told: “I was formerly a <i>brahman</i>, son of an eminent <i>brahman</i>, and versed in the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Vedāṅgas</i>, and friend of a king, who was accomplished in the <i>Dhanurveda</i>, and thence skilled in archery myself; one day, when I accompanied the king on a hunting expedition, I killed a <i>ṛṣi</i>, whom I took for a deer, and was cursed by him to be born as a fowler in the <i>śūdra</i> caste (III, <b>215</b>); but I prevailed upon him to grant me that I should remain a pious man and honour my parents, and thereby attain great perfection (<i>siddhiṃ</i>), remember my past life, and again become a <i>brahman</i>. I took the <i>ṛṣi</i> to the hermitage, and he did not die.”—<i>Kauśika</i> saluted him respectfully, and having returned home he honoured his old parents (III, <b>216</b>)."
