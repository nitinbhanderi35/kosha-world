Sugrīva and the monkeys Suṣeṇa, etc. (α), surrounded them. Vibhīṣaṇa came and roused them with the Prajñāstra; Sugrīva extracted the arrows and applied the medicine <i>viśalyā</i>; from the mountain Śveta a Guhyaka of Kubera's brought water, by rubbing one's eyes with which all invisible creatures became visible. Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, etc. (β), rubbed their eyes. Having informed Rāvaṇa, Indrajit returned without having completed his daily sacrifice; receiving a hint from Vibhīṣaṇa, Lakṣmaṇa killed Indrajit. Rāvaṇa would kill Sītā, but was dissuaded by Avindhya (III, <b>289</b>)."
