He pleased Aṅgiras by means of his austerities and due to the latter's blessing Kṛtadyuti delivered a son. But, her co-wives poisoned the child to death at which both Citraketu and Kṛtadyuti fell down unconscious. Though Aṅgiras and Nārada appeared on the scene and tried their best to console the King and the queen they refused to be comforted. Then Aṅgiras returned to them the soul of the dead child. The soul saluted them and spoke as follows:—“Oh elders, during various births I had been the son of various parents. And, you please point out to me the particular parent as whose son I am to live just now.” Nobody had any answer to this question, and the child went on its own way. <dvsn n='NI'/>Afterwards Citraketu and Kṛtadyuti went round the earth as great devotees of the Almighty, and during this perambulation Citraketu came to the presence of Śiva on whose thigh Pārvatī was sitting then. Citraketu felt ashamed at the sight and questioned Pārvatī about her action whereupon she cursed and turned Citraketu into an Asura. The well known Vṛtrāsura was Citraketu thus reborn. Kṛtadyuti ended her life following the curse upon her husband. (Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha)."
