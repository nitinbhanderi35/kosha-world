It was through this river that Kuntīdevī floated in a box the infant Karṇa. At night accompanied by her maid, Kunti floated the box containing her illegitimate son and stood on the banks of Aśvanadī weeping bitterly. Then thinking that her father would notice her absence from the palace she returned home soon. The box floated and reached the country, Campāpurī, ruled by a charioteer. (Ślokas 22 to 26, Chapter 308, Araṇya Parva, M.B.)."
