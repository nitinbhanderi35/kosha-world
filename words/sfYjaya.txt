This king Śviti was also called Śvitya King. On the death of his father Sṛñjaya became king. <dvsn n='NI'/>The hermits Nārada and Parvata were friends of Sṛñjaya. Once both of them came and lived in the palace of the King as his guests. Sṛñjaya had a beautiful daughter named Śucismitā. Both Nārada and Parvata loved her. One day Nārada directly asked Sṛñjaya, for the hand of his daughter. Parvata got angry at this and cursed Nārada that he would not attain heaven. Nārada retorted with the same curse. Sṛñjaya pacified both. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sṛñjaya had no sons. He informed the hermits of this sad state. Nārada blessed the king and said that a son named Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī would be born to him and that with his birth everything in the palace would become gold. Accordingly the son Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī was born to Sṛñjaya and everything in the palace became golden. When the son became four years old, by the sorcery of Indra the child died. Nārada brought him to life again. (See under Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī). <dvsn n='NI'/>The fact that gold was accumulating in the palace of Sṛñjaya due to the boon given to Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī, reached the ears of robbers. One night they carried the child away, and killed him. Then only did they come to understand that there was no gold inside him. Sṛñjaya cried aloud at the loss of his son. To pacify the King, Nārada and Parvata told him stories of sixteen kings. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 55). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Sṛñjaya sits in the palace of Yama, praising him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 15). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) When Nārada told the King the stories of sixteen Kings, his sorrow subsided. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 71, Stanza 4). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) By the power of Nārada Sṛñjaya's son was brought to life again.
