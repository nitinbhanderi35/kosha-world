Viṣṇu appeared before them and promised them a son by asking them to marry the daughter of Kaṇḍu and Pramlocā; pleased with seeing the God they praised Him; after his disappearance they came out of the waters and seeing the earth filled with wild growth they began to burn the trees by breathing spiritual fire and wind from their mouth. Brahmā (Soma) interceded then and prevented them from further destroying the trees by offering Vārkṣi (Māriṣā) the daughter of the trees in marriage to them; they married her and she gave birth to Dakṣa on the eve of the Cākṣuṣa epoch.<sup>1</sup> After a long period of enjoyment of life they placed their wife under their son Dakṣa and went away to the western sea where Jajali attained siddhi; seeing them steadfast in devotion Nārada came there, and was welcomed by them; requested by them to be instructed to get rid of samsāra, Nārada advised them to worship and contemplate on Viṣṇu directly, and than departed; they did so and attained the world of Viṣṇu;<sup>2</sup> sacrifice of, when Nārada sang praises of Dhruva;<sup>3</sup> worshipped for treasure.<sup>4</sup> <F>1) Bhā.
