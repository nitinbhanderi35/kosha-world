One day certain fishermen coming to that lake began to bale out its waters to a lower ground through diverse outlets. He of great forethought, having in vain warned the others, immediately set out through a current and reached another deep lake. The procrastinating one was caught with many others and tied to a string. He of presence of mind thrust himself into the company of those so tied, and remained quietly among them biting the string, and escaped when the fishes were removed to a piece of deep water to be washed. The procrastinating one met with his death (XII, <b>137</b>)."
