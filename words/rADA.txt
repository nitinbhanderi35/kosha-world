When Kṛṣṇa lived in Gokula as a man with two hands Rādhā was his dearest consort. But when he lives in Vaikuṇṭha as four-handed Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī is his dearest consort. (Devī Bhāgavata 9, 1; Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa, 2, 49 and 56-57 and Ādi Parva Chapter 11). <dvsn n='NI'/>Different versions about the birth of Rādhā are given in the Purāṇas, as follows:— <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) She was born in Gokula as daughter of Vṛṣabhānu and Kalāvatī. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa, 2, 49; 35-42; Nārada Purāṇa, 2. 81). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) She was got as Bhūmi-kanyā (earth-girl) when King Vṛṣabhānu was preparing the ground to conduct a Yajña. (Padma Purāṇa; Brahma Purāṇa 7). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) She was born from the left side of Kṛṣṇa. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) At the time of Kṛṣṇa's birth Viṣṇu asked his attendants to be born on earth. Accordingly Rādhā, dear consort of Kṛṣṇa, took her birth in Gokula under the star Jyeṣṭhā in the morning of Śuklāṣṭamī day in Bhādrapada month. (Ādi Parva 11), <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Kṛṣṇa once went with Virajā, the Gopī woman, to the hall of enjoyment (rāsamaṇḍalam). Knowing about it Rādhā followed them to the hall, but both of them were not to be seen. On another occasion when Rādhā found Virajā in the company of Kṛṣṇa and Sudāmā she, in great anger, insulted Kṛṣṇa whereupon Sudāmā cursed her to be born in human womb and experience the pangs of separation from Kṛṣṇa. (Nārada Purāṇa 2. 8; Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa. 2. 49) and Rādhā cursed him in turn to be born in the dānava dynasty. It was on account of this curse of Rādhā that Sudāmā was born as the asura called Śaṅkhacūḍa. (Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇa, 2. 4. 9. 34). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vi) Rādhā is considered to be one of the five forces which help Viṣṇu in the process of creation. (Devī Bhāgavata 9. 1; Nārada Purāṇa 2. 81). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vii) Rādhā is the mental power of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (For details see under Pañcaprāṇas)."
