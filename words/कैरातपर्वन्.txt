Kairāta). § 331. It is anew related how <i>Arjuna</i> set out from the <i>Kāmyaka</i> wood towards the north; he entered a terrible forest (description), resorted to by <i>Siddhas</i> and <i>Cāraṇas</i>, and then proceeded to the <i>Himavat</i> (description). For four months he practised austerities (specified), until the <i>ṛṣis</i> made representations about it to <i>Śiva</i>, who dismissed them after having removed their fears (III, <b>38</b>). Then <i>Śiva</i> with his bow and arrows, in the guise of a <i>Kirāta</i>, accompanied by <i>Umā</i> in the guise of a <i>Kirāta</i> woman, by merry spirits (<i>bhūtaiḥ</i>), and thousands of women, approached <i>Arjuna</i> as he was about to kill <i>Mūka</i>, a son of <i>Danu</i>, who in the form of a boar would have killed <i>Arjuna. Arjuna</i> and <i>Śiva</i> at the same time pierced <i>Mūka</i> with their arrows, and killed him; when dying he again assumed his <i>rākṣasa</i> form; then they fought against each other, first with arrows, then with the very bows, then with swords, then with trees and stones, then with the fists, and then by clasping each other; at last <i>Arjuna</i> lost his senses, and was almost reduced to a ball of flesh; when he regained consciousness he made a clay image of <i>Śiva</i>, which he worshipped with a garland, which then appeared on the head of the <i>Kirāta</i>; he thus learned that it was <i>Śiva</i>, and prostrated himself at his feet. <i>Śiva</i> declared that <i>Arjuna's</i> prowess was equal to his own, promised to give him his weapon, and gave him ‘eye’ (<i>cakṣus</i>), so that he beheld him in his true form, together with <i>Umā</i>.—§ 332: <i>Arjuna</i> then fell on his knees and worshipped him, saying: “O <i>Kapardin!</i> etc.” (v. <i>Mahādevastava</i>) (III, <b>39</b>).—§ 333: Śiva said that <i>Arjuna (b</i>) was in a former life <i>Nara</i>, etc. When granted a boon, <i>Arjuna</i> asked <i>Śiva</i> to give him the <i>Pāśupata</i> weapon named <i>Brahmaśiras (c</i>). Having purified himself he was instructed in its use on the condition that he should not hurl it against a human being, for then it would destroy the universe. The earth trembled, etc. The gods and <i>Dānavas</i> beheld the weapon in its bodily shape standing by the side of <i>Arjuna</i>. When <i>Arjuna</i> had been touched by <i>Śiva</i>, all that was evil in his body was dispelled. Having said to <i>Arjuna</i>, “Go thou into heaven,” <i>Śiva</i> went up into the skies accompanied by <i>Umā</i> (III, <b>40</b>).—§ 334: Then <i>Arjuna</i> was on the <i>Himavat</i> visited by the <i>Lokapālas</i>, viz., <i>Varuṇa</i> (blue as lapis lazuli), together with rivers, <i>Nāgas</i>, <i>Daityas</i>, and <i>Sādhyas; Kubera</i>, who dwells on <i>Kailāsa</i>, golden-coloured (<i>jāmbūnadavapuḥ</i>), accompanied by <i>Yakṣas</i>; <i>Yama</i>, with staff in hand (<i>daṇḍapāṇiḥ</i>), illuminating the three worlds, and the <i>Guhyakas, Gandharvas</i>, and <i>Nagās</i>, accompanied by those lords of the creation (<i>lokabhāvanaiḥ</i>) the <i>Pitṛs</i>; further <i>Śakra</i>, with <i>Māhendrāṇī</i>, mounted on the neck of <i>Airāvata</i>, and surrounded by the gods, and eulogized by <i>Gandharvas</i> and <i>ṛṣis</i>. Each of them occupied a particular summit of <i>Himavat</i> (<i>Yama</i> to the south, <i>Varuṇa</i> to the west). They granted him ‘sight’ (<i>dṛṣṭi</i>), that he might see them. <i>Yama</i> said that <i>Arjuna</i> would defeat the <i>Nivātakavacas</i>, etc., and gave him his irresistible staff (<i>daṇḍa</i>) as a weapon. <i>Varuṇa (b</i>) gave him his irresistible nooses. <i>Kubera</i> said that in bygone <i>kalpas Arjuna</i> had always gone through ascetic austerities along with them, and gave him his favourite weapon <i>Antardhāna (c). Indra</i> said he would descend to earth in his chariot with <i>Mātali</i> as his charioteer, and taking him to heaven grant him all his celestial weapons (III, <b>41</b>)."
