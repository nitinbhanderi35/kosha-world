This power of Vaikuṇṭha to give living things deliverance, is mentioned in Padma Purāṇa, Brahma khaṇḍa, Chapter 3, as follows: <dvsn n='NI'/>Vaikuṇṭha once lighted a ghee-lamp in the presence of Viṣṇu in Kārttika and returned home. At that time a rat came there and began to drink the ghee. Then the lamp blazed into a flame. The rat was terrified at this, and ran away. But by the grace of Viṣṇu the rat got deliverance from all its sins. <dvsn n='NI'/>That rat was killed by snake-bite. The men of Yama came with ropes. Instantly the messengers of Viṣṇu also came on Garuḍa. Yama's men got afraid of Viṣṇu's messengers and humbly asked them: “For what goodness of him are you taking this great sinner to Vaikuṇṭha?” They replied: “He had blazed a lamp before the presence of Viṣṇu. That act has earned for him a place in Vaikuṇṭha. The goodness earned by lighting a lamp with devotion and love in Kārttika, could be described only by Mukunda.” After that the rat was taken to Vaikuṇṭha."
