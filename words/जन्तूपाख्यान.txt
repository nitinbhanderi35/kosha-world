At last, when he and his wives were old, he got a son <i>Jantu</i>, whom all the wives surrounded with the utmost care. One day when <i>Jantu</i> had been stung by an ant at his hip and cried, <i>Somaka</i>, afraid of losing him, inquired of his <i>ṛtvij</i> if there were a ceremony by which a man might get 100 sons. He was told to sacrifice <i>Jantu</i> and let his wives take a smell of the smoke of his fat; then 100 sons would be born to him, and <i>Jantu</i> himself would be born once more of the same mother, with a mark of gold on his back (III, <b>127</b>). The sacrifice was performed notwithstanding the screams of the wives, and after ten months 100 sons were born, of whom <i>Jantu</i> was the eldest and most beloved and superior in merit, and had that mark of gold. When the <i>guru</i> and <i>Somaka</i> had died, the <i>purohita</i> was grilled in a terrible hell for having performed that sacrifice, and <i>Somaka</i> prevailed upon <i>Dharmarāja</i> (who said “one cannot enjoy or suffer for another person's acts”) that he should be likewise tormented for the same period before he entered the blessed regions. Here they (the Pāṇḍavas, etc.) spent six nights (III, <b>128</b>)."
