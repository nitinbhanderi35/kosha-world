In L. 2 we get the form Saṃgohāli, while in L. 20, it is mentioned as Saṃgohalikāgrāma.<sup>432</sup> Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Gulmagandhikāgrāma’ in place of Saṃgohālikagrāma.<sup>433</sup> But Saṃgohālikagrāma is the correct form. We can compare Saṃgohāli in L. 2 of this inscription with the letters appearing in L. 20. The first three letters are no doubt not fully legible, but the two remaining are surely ‘lika’. Thus the name can never be Gulmagandhikā, most probably it was Saṃgohālika. Moreover, the context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same. <dvsn n='P'/>The word gohālī when joined with the suffix ‘saṃ’ means ‘a good gohālī’. In Inscription No. 28 the word gohālī has in all cases been spelt with long ‘ī’, i. e. gohālī.<sup>434</sup>"
