Desirous of subjugating the three worlds, they practised terrible penances on the mountain <i>Vindhya</i>, which, by the power of their austerities at last began to emit vapour. In vain the gods repeatedly tempted them by means of every precious possession and beautiful girls, and by illusion, causing their sisters, mothers, wives, etc., to appear pursued by a <i>rākṣasa</i> and imploring their help. When <i>Brahmán</i> granted them a boon, they asked to become immortal, which he refused, granting them instead that they should not need to be afraid of anything except each other, etc. They now desisted from their asceticism and returned to their abode, where they lived happy, causing even the moon to rise over their city every night, even out of season (I, <b>209</b>). They set out to conquer the three worlds in the night under the constellation of <i>Maghāḥ</i>, with a large <i>Daitya</i> force cased in mail, etc. The gods sought refuge in <i>Brahmaloka</i>, and the <i>Daityas</i> subjugated <i>Indraloka</i>, and vanquished the tribes of the <i>Yakṣas</i> and <i>Rakṣases</i>, and the <i>Khecaras</i>, and the <i>Nāgas</i> in the earth, and the tribes of the <i>Mlecchas</i> dwelling in the ocean. In order to extinguish the sacrifices that strengthened the gods, they slew those that were performing sacrifices and the assistant <i>brahmans</i>, etc. Then they took up their abode in <i>Kurukṣetra</i> (I, <b>210</b>). The <i>Devarṣis</i> and <i>Siddhas</i> and <i>ṛṣis</i> were affected with great grief, and went to the abode of <i>Pitāmaha</i>, seated with the gods, the <i>Siddhas</i>, and the <i>Brahmarṣis, Mahādeva, Agni</i>, <i>Vāyu</i>, the sun and moon, <i>Śakra</i>, the <i>Pārameṣṭhya ṛṣis</i>, the <i>Vaikhānasas</i>, the <i>Vālakhilyas</i>, the <i>Vānaprasthas</i>, the <i>Marīcipas</i>, the <i>Ajas</i>, the <i>Avimūḍhas</i>, etc. <i>Brahmán</i> sent <i>Tilottamā (b</i>) to them (I, <b>211</b>). She came to <i>Sunda</i> and <i>Upasunda</i> as they were sporting in the <i>Vindhya</i> mountains, and from jealousy they struck each other to death with their maces. And <i>Pitāmaha</i> then came there with the gods and the great <i>ṛṣis</i>, and granted to <i>Tilottamā</i> that she should roam in the region of the <i>Ādityas</i>. Then, bestowing the three worlds on <i>Indra</i> as before, he returned to his own region."
