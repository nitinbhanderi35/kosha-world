Rājadharman) <i>hi mām āśritaḥ sadā</i>) 12. 165. 8; hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was prepared to give Gautama all that he desired 12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gautama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's residence under the <i>nyagrodha</i> tree, the latter welcomed Gautama and tried to remove his fatigue by fanning him with wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27; Gautama thought of returning home but since he had nothing to eat on way the ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rājadharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165. 31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with flames for the protection of Gautama at night, and he slept by the side of Gautama fully trusting him (<i>viśvasta</i>); Gautama killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he dressed the bird by removing his wings and hair (<i>sa taṃ vipakṣaromāṇaṃ kṛtvā</i> 12. 166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking the gold and meat with him Gautama started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of days passed without Rājadharman's going to meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was, might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence and find out whether he was alive; Virūpākṣa's son saw near the <i>nyagrodha</i> tree only a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his associates pursued Gautama, captured him, and returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rājadharman which was without wings, bones and feet (<i>°śarīraṃ ca pakṣāsthicaraṇojjhitam</i> 12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lamented over the loss of his friend and prepared a funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread over with perfumes and many pieces of cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman, Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre (in the sky); the foam from her mouth, mixed with milk, fell down on the burning pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman was alive (<i>diṣṭyāyaṃ jīvatīty uta</i> 12. 167. 6); Indra told them an old incident (<i>purā-</i> <i>tanam</i> 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion, Rājadharman had failed to present himself in the assembly (<i>sadas</i>) of Brahmadeva; the enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die soon (<i>tasmād vadhaṃ sa duṣṭātmā nacirāt</i> <i>samavāpsyati</i> 12. 167. 9 [<i>na cirāt</i> seems to contradict <i>purātanam</i>]); hence Rājadharman was killed by Gautama, but was again revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12. 167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably disposed to Rājadharman he was requested by Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life; Indra revived Gautama and gave him to Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman embraced Gautama who had with him all kinds of vessels full of gold (<i>sabhāṇḍopaskaram</i> 12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14; Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of Brahmadeva and was received with guest worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rājadharman and Gautama is called <i>ākhyāna</i> 12. 167. 18. <dvsn n='P'>[See Nāḍījaṅgha]"
