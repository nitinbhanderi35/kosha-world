Once the Devas appeared to Kubera at this tīrtha and granted him overlordship of wealth, friendship of Śiva, Deva-hood and rulership of the world. The Marudgaṇas crowned him King. He got the son Nalakūbara also there. The place, thus important in many ways came to be reputed as Kuberatīrtha in later years. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 97)."
