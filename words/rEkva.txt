The following is a story about the fame of this King. <dvsn n='NI'/>One night while this King was sleeping, some hermits took the form of swans and were flying through the air. One of them saw the radiance of the fame of Jānaśruti shining brightly. The other swans said that the fame of Raikva was far greater than this. Jānaśruti heard this. He found out Raikva and placed all his wealth at the foot of Raikva and gave him his daughter in marriage."
