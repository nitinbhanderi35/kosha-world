Seems to be a nonce-formation analogical to saṃdṛśyante, regular passive, <i>they are seen</i>, which occurs three times in the text just before (lines 16, 18, 20); the meaning is confirmed by the following conclusion of the simile: evam eva sudhanaḥ … tāni sarvavyūhavikurvitāny adrākṣīt. To the <lex>pass.</lex> saṃdṛśyate, <i>is seen</i>, was formed an active saṃdṛśyati, <i>sees</i>. The same seems true once of <b>dṛśyati</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab>"
