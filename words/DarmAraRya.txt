After that he went in search of means to attain heaven. In his quest, he happened to reach the realm of Nāgas (serpents). He entered the house of a Nāga named Padmanābha. When he reached the house Padmanābha had been away carrying the chariot of the Sun. Dharmāraṇya sat outside the house and spent a few days in vow and meditation. Then Padmanābha returned. The Brāhmaṇa asked Padmanābha about the ways of attaining heaven. The Nāga replied that there was none superior to the Sun. The Brahmin accepted penance and lived in the hermitage of Cyavana for a few days. (M.B. Śānti Parva, 4 Chapters from 361)."
