Suddenly a wind from the north-east brought a celestial lotus of 1,000 petals, which <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> presented to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; she sent <i>Bhīma</i> to bring others, in order to carry them to their hermitage in <i>Kāmyaka. Bhīma</i> proceeded along the slopes of the <i>Gandhamādana (b</i>); the lions, etc., fled; invisible, the wives of <i>Yakṣas</i> and <i>Gandharvas</i> stared at him. After having bathed in a lake, he blew his shell and began to proceed into a plaintain wood, but was arrested by his brother the ape <i>Hanumat</i>, who for his good obstructed the way to heaven (<i>divaṅgamaṃ mārgaṃ</i>), saying that this was the path to the <i>devaloka</i>, impassable by mortals, save the way of <i>siddhi (siddhigatiṃ</i>) (III, <b>146</b>). <i>Hanumat</i> said he was suffering from illness and could not rise; but <i>Bhīma</i> would not leap over him, and could not remove his tail.— §§ 425-430: <i>Hanumad-Bhīma-saṃvāda</i> (q.v.)."
