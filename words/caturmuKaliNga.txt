Brahmā, to start with, created animate and inanimate objects, and was thinking about further creation when a beautiful girl, born of herself appeared before him. Brahmā became enamoured of that girl and showed an unbecoming passion. As a punishment for this sin one of his heads broke. Thus broken-headed Brahmā, went to the Sthāṇutīrtha, which washes off all sins, on the northern bank of Sarasvatī and installed his own liṅga, known as the Caturmukhaliṅga. This installation of liṅga redeemed him from sins. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 49)."
