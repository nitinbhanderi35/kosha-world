Both of them were very powerful, and Kumbha, in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war defeated the army of monkeys on various occasions. Many of the ministers of Sugrīva tried to defeat Kumbha. Aṅgada, son of Bāli also could not stand up to him. Then Sugrīva fought against Kumbha and flung him into the sea when the water in it rose up to the level of mount Vindhya. Kumbha came ashore from the sea roaring but was fisted to death by Sugrīva. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Canto 76)."
