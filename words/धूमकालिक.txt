This, I believe, is the <ab>mg.</ab> of the <lang>Pali</lang> word too; both the <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>comm.</ab> and modern interpreters misunderstand it. In <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔ii.288.20〕 (bhavissanti vattāro:) dhūmakālikaṃ samaṇena Gotamena sāvakānaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ, (if we do not preserve the Gospel, <i>people will say</i>:) <i>a perishable set of religious teachings was taught by the monk <ab n='Gotama'>G.</ab> to his disciples</i>, or in other words, these teachings are perishing, or will perish. In <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔ii.172.15〕, the only other passage recorded, dhūmakālikaṃ pi pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ navakammaṃ denti, <i>or they give as new work</i> (the reparation of) <i>a completed monastery that has proved perishable</i>, that has [Page286-b] fallen into ruin, or begun to. The <lex>adj.</lex> dhūmakālika cannot mean, as is supposed, <i>lasting to</i> (the monkʼs) <i>funeral</i>, for then it would be synonymous with yāvajīvikaṃ, just before it, in line 15; the time expressions vīsativassikaṃ, tiṃsavassikaṃ, yāvajīvikaṃ, lines 14—15, all forbidden, contrast with lines 26—29 where jobs lasting from 5 or 6 to 10 or 12 years are permitted, but only upon an akataṃ or a vippakataṃ vihāraṃ; it is these latter expressions, in line 25, which contrast with the (forbidden) work on a dhūmakālikaṃ pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ. It seems that this derivative of (<lang>Pali</lang>) dhūmakāla came to be used figuratively in a way fairly remote from its original and literal <ab>mg.</ab>, like English <i>to go up in smoke = to be destroyed, completely lost</i>."
