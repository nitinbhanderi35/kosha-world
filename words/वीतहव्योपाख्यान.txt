Haihaya</i> (or <i>Vītahavya</i>) had 10 wives and 100 heroic sons, who all studied the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Dhanurveda</i>. In <i>Kāśi</i> was king <i>Haryaśva</i>, the grandfather of <i>Divodāsa</i>. The sons of king <i>Haihaya (Vītahavya-dāyādaiḥ</i>) invaded <i>Kāśi</i> and slew king <i>Haryaśva</i> in a battle between the <i>Gaṅgā</i> and the <i>Yamunā</i>, and then went back to their own delightful city in the <i>Vatsa</i>country. Meanwhile <i>Haryaśva's</i> son <i>Sudeva</i> was installed as <i>Kāśi</i>-king. The 100 sons of <i>Vītahavya</i> once more came and defeated him in battle, and then returned to their own city. After this, <i>Sudeva's</i> son <i>Divodāsa</i> became installed as <i>Kāśi</i>king; at the command of <i>Indra</i> he built the city of <i>Vārāṇasī</i> between the <i>Gaṅgā</i> and the southern bank of the <i>Gomatī</i>. The <i>Haihayas</i> again attacked <i>Divodāsa</i>; he fought for 1,000 days, lost his army, left his capital, and fled away to the retreat of <i>Bharadvāja</i>, who was his priest, and performed a sacrifice, in consequence of which <i>Pratardana</i> was born to him. On the same day when <i>Pratardana</i> was born, he grew as great as a boy of 13 years, and mastered the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Dhanurveda, Bharadvāja</i> (aided by <i>Yoga</i>) having entered into the prince and caused all the energy of the universe to enter his body (he was praised by bards and D-ṛ., etc.; description). <i>Divodāsa</i> installed <i>Pratardana</i> as <i>yuvarāja</i> and ordered him to march against the sons of <i>Vītahavya. Pratardana</i> speedily crossed the <i>Gaṅgā</i> and proceeded against the city of the <i>Vītahavyas</i> and slew them all. King <i>Vītahavya</i> fled away to the retreat of <i>Bhṛgu. Pratardana</i> followed in his footsteps and ordered <i>Bhṛgu</i> to surrender king <i>Vītahavya. Bhṛgu</i> said: “there is no <i>kṣatriya</i> in this retreat; they who are here are all brahmans.” <i>Pratardana</i> returned home, and <i>Vītahavya</i> became a Br-ṛ. in consequence of <i>Bhṛgu's</i> statement. <i>Vītahavya > Gṛtsamada</i> (V-ṛ., resembling <i>Indra</i> and, therefore, once afflicted by Dai.; alleged quotation from the <i>Ṛgveda</i>) <i>> Sutejas > Varcas > Vihavya > Vitatya > Satya ></i> <i>Santa ></i> Ṛ. <i>Śravas > Tamas > Prakāśa > Vāgindra > Pramati</i> (B. <i>°mi°</i>) (mastering the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Vedāṅgas</i>) <i>> Rura</i> (begotten upon Aps. <i>Ghṛtācī</i>) <i>> Śunaka</i> (begotten upon <i>Pramadvarā</i>) <i>></i> <i>Śaunaka</i> (XIII, <b>30</b>)."
