Guhanandin was the name of a Jaina Ācāryya. <dvsn n='P'/>The names of the Digaṃbara Ācāryas of the third and fourth centuries, such as Yaśonandin Jayanandin, and Kumāranandin generally end in nandin. As Puṇḍravardhana was one of the seats of Jaina pontiffs, beginning with Gupti-Gupta or Viśākhācāryya, the disciple of Bhadrabāhu II, it has been suggested that Guhanandin also belonged to the same place.<sup>35</sup>"
