The self-born <i>Mānasa</i> created a lotus pregnant with Energy > <i>Brahmán</i> > all things, <i>Brahmán = Ananta: Agni</i> and <i>Soma</i> (= the Sun and the Moon) are his eyes, etc. <i>Bharadvāja</i> asked <i>Bhṛgu</i> about the extent of the firmament. <i>Bhṛgu</i> explained that the firmament or Space is infinite, and is peopled with systems upon systems of self-luminous bodies (<i>devāḥ</i>), etc. <i>Bharadvāja</i> asked why <i>Brahmán</i> is called the first-born and not the Lotus whence he sprang. <i>Bhṛgu's</i> answer: The earth is that lotus, created to give rise to that form of <i>Mānasa</i> which became <i>Brahmán; Sumeru</i>, reaching up to heaven, became its pericarp (XII, <b>182</b>). <i>Bharadvāja</i> asked how <i>Brahmán</i>, residing within <i>Meru</i>, created all things. <i>Bhṛgu</i> said that <i>Mānasa</i> [in his form of Brahmán, PCR.] created by fiat of Will, first water, which is the life of all creatures; earth, etc., are transformations of water, and have been produced by the solidification of that element. <i>Bharadvāja</i> enquired after the manner and order of the creation of the several elements; <i>Bhṛgu</i> explained that in very ancient times (the <i>Brahmakalpa</i>) Br.-r., assembled together, felt this very doubt, engaged in contemplation for 1,000 celestial years, and then heard a celestial voice saying: “Formerly there was only infinite Space…” (XII, <b>183</b>). Asked by <i>Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu</i> explained why only the five primal elements are called <i>Bhūtas. Bharadvāja</i> enquired why all the elements are not seen in the immobile objects. <i>Bhṛgu</i> explained how all objects consist of all the five primal elements, but in each the proportions are different; as example he adduced the trees, which he showed to be not inanimate, etc.; through the breath called <i>Prāṇa</i> living creatures are enabled to move; through <i>Vyāna</i> they put forth strength for action; <i>Apāna</i> moves downward; <i>Samāna</i> resides within the heart; through <i>Udāna</i> one eructates and is enabled to utter the seven original notes called <i>Ṣadja</i>, etc. (α) (XII, <b>184</b>). Asked by <i>Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu</i> explained how fire resides within a living body, and how wind moves the body; <i>Prāṇa (c), Samāna (d), Apāna (e), Udāna (f</i>), <i>Vyāna (g</i>) (XII, <b>185</b>). <i>Bharadvāja's</i> observations on life being worth little if that which is called life be due to the action of fire and wind only (XII, <b>186</b>). <i>Bhṛgu's</i> observations on the indestructibility of living creatures; <i>Bharadvāja's</i> objection; <i>Bhṛgu's</i> answer (“it is fire that sustains the breaths <i>Prāṇa</i>, etc.; that heat is called life…”). <i>Bharadvāja</i> enquired on the true nature of life; <i>Bhṛgu</i> explained that it is <i>antarātman</i> that inspires the body: water —the soul (<i>ātmā) = Brahmán</i> (in all creatures) = <i>kṣetrajña</i> and <i>paramátman</i> respectively; etc. There is no destruction of the living agent; it is the body that is dissolved in death (XII, <b>187</b>). <i>Bhṛgu</i> said: <i>Brahmán</i> first created only some <i>brahmans</i> who were <i>Prajāpatis</i>; then Truth, etc. (β); then D., Dā., G., Dai., As., M.-U., Y., Rā., N., Pś., and men with their four divisions: <i>brahmans</i> (white), <i>kṣattriyas</i> (red), <i>vaiśyas</i> (yellow), and <i>śūdras</i> (black); etc. <i>Bharadvāja</i> was unwilling to admit any original distinction between the four castes; <i>Bhṛgu</i> admitted that there is no original distinction between them; all the world at first consisted of only <i>brahmans</i>; how the different castes gradually rose; those are not <i>brahmans</i> that are incapable of understanding that every created thing is the Supreme <i>Brahmán</i>; they take birth as Pś., Rā., <i>Pretas</i>, and <i>Mlecchas</i> (XII, <b>188</b>). What acts constitute a <i>brahman</i>, a <i>kṣattriya</i>, a <i>vaiśya</i>, a <i>śūdra</i>; a <i>śūdra</i> may become a <i>brahman</i> by adopting the characteristics of a <i>brahman</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>; the duties that one should observe to become truly righteous; the mind should be united with <i>Prāṇa</i>, and <i>Prāṇa</i> be held within <i>Brahmán</i> (XII, <b>189</b>). <i>Bhṛgu</i> discoursed on the characteristics of Truth and Untruth; happiness should always be sought; upon what happiness depends; <i>Bharadvāja</i> doubted that happiness is the highest aim (“<i>Brahmán</i> lives alone, observant of the vow of <i>brahma-</i> <i>carya; Śiva</i> brought <i>Kāma</i> to extinction”); <i>Bhṛgu's</i> discourse in explanation of <i>Bharadvāja's</i> doubt (“the earth is the progenitrix of all creatures; females partake of her nature; the male animal is like <i>Prajāpati</i> himself”) (XII, <b>190</b>). Asked by <i>Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu</i> explained the consequences of gifts, of righteousness, of conduct, of penances, of the study of the <i>Vedas</i>, and of Sacrifices. Asked by <i>Bharadvāja</i>, he then discoursed about the several kinds of duty; then about the four modes of life (laid down in days of old by <i>Brahmán</i> for the benefit of the world) and the duties of the several modes (XII, <b>191</b>); on the duties of the Forest mode of life; on those of the <i>Parivrājakas. Bharadvāja</i> enquired about the existence of any region beyond that which we inhabit; <i>Bhṛgu</i> indicated the existence in the North (on the other side of <i>Himavat</i>) of a region that is the abode of the righteous: “Here <i>Brahmán</i> in days of yore, and all the gods with Ṛ., having performed proper penances, became purified and attained to <i>Brahmán.”—Bharadvāja</i> worshipped <i>Bhṛgu</i> with veneration (XII, <b>192</b>)."
