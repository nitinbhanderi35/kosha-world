Such roots are termed अनुदात्त verily because they are possessed of an  anudātta vowel. e. g. कृ, भृ, जि, गम्, हन् etc. as against भु, धू, तॄ, श्वि, वृ, वद्, फल्, चल्, etc. which have their vowel characterized by an acute (उदात्त) accent. For a complete list of such roots see the well-known stanzas given in the Siddhāntakaumudī incidentally on आत्मनेपदेष्वनतः P. VII.1.5. ऊदॄदन्तैर्यौतिरुक्ष्णुशीङ्स्नु....निहताः स्मृताः ॥ १ ॥ शक्लृपच्मुचिरिचवच्विच् .........धातवो द्व्यधिकं शतम् ॥ as also some lists by ancient grammarians given in the Mahābhāṣya on एकाच उपदेशेनुदात्तात्. P. VII. 2.10 or in the Kāśikā on the same rule P. VII.2.10."
