In Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 342, Abhinaya has been defined as follows: Abhinaya is the art of presenting before the people the ideas that are to be communicated to them. There are four divisions of this art known as Sāttvika, Vācika, Āṅgika and Āhārya depending on Sattva, Vāk, Aṅga and Āhārya. Besides these, another division known as Abhimānika (Abhimānottha) may also be mentioned. This signifies the expression of rasas like Śṛṅgāra. There are two kinds of Śṛṅgāra known as Saṃbhoga and Vipralambha. Four varieties of Vipralambha called Pūrvānurāga Vipralambha, Māna Vipralambha, Pravāsa Vipralambha and Karuṇa Vipralambha are mentioned. The union after Vipralambha is Saṃbhoga-Śṛṅgāra. All Sāttvika bhāvas are included in Śṛṅgāra. All these have to be expressed through Abhinaya."
