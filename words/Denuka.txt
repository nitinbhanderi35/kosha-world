There were several palm trees in the forest, the fruits of which they shook with force. Hearing the noise Dhenuka ran to them. Balabhadra and Śrī Kṛṣṇa beat the giant to death. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Other details.</i> (1) In Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, it is stated that Pralambaka, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta, Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśi, Dhenuka and others were the followers of Kaṃsa. <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) In Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, there is another story that while Balabhadra Rāma, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the other cowherds were looking after the cows an asura entered into the midst of the flock, in the shape of a cow (Dhenu).
