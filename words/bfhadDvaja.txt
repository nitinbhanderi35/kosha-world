One day Bṛhaddhvaja happened to meet with Keśinī, the beautiful wife of king Bhīmakeśa. The lustful giant was about to take her away, when she told him thus:—“I hate my husband very much. So I am ready to come with you, of my own accord.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Taking her in his chariot the giant went to Gaṅgāsāgara saṅgama. When she learned that this place was under the rule of her husband, she died of fear. Being unable to bear separation from Keśinī, the giant also died. As these two had died at the holy place of Gaṅgāsāgara saṅgama, both attained the world of Viṣṇu. (Skanda Purāṇa, Kriyākāṇḍa)."
