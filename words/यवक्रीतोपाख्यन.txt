The learned <i>Raibhya</i> and the Ṛṣi <i>Bharadvāja</i> were friends. <i>Raibhya</i> had two learned sons, <i>Arvāvasu</i> and <i>Parāvasu; Bharadvāja</i> only one son, <i>Yavakrīta</i>. As <i>Yavakrīta</i> saw that <i>Raibhya</i> and his sons were esteemed by the <i>brahmans</i>, while <i>Bharadvāja</i> was slighted, he practised austerities (exposing himself to a blazing fire) in order to acquire Vedic knowledge for himself and his father (cf. v. 10817) instead of acquiring it from a teacher during a long time. <i>Indra</i> was alarmed, and twice he in vain attempted to make <i>Yavakrīta</i> desist from his penances, saying that they never could be successful. As <i>Yavakrīta</i> declared that he would cut off his limbs and sacrifice them in the fire, <i>Indra</i> assumed the guise of an old decrepit brahman, and began to throw up a dam of sand at that spot of the <i>Bhāgīrathī</i> where <i>Yavakrīta</i> used to bathe, and declared that <i>Yavakrīta's</i> intentions were equally impossible. Then <i>Yavakrīta</i> desisted from his plan, and <i>Indra</i> granted him that the <i>Vedas</i> should be revealed to him and his father, and that he should excel other men. <i>Bharadvāja</i> said that <i>Yavakrīta</i> would become proud and uncharitable and thence destruction would soon overtake him (§ 415), and told him some gāthās, narrated by the gods, about <i>Medhāvin</i> (q.v.).—§ 416. <i>Bharadvāja</i> made <i>Yavakrīta</i> promise to shun the irritable <i>Raibhya</i> and his sons, and <i>Yavakrīta</i> began to offend other <i>ṛṣis</i> (III, <b>135</b>). Once, in the month of <i>Mādhava</i>, he came to the hermitage of <i>Raibhya</i> and seduced (?) (cf. <i>sajjayām āsa</i>, var. lect. Nīl., instead of <i>majjayām āsa</i>) the wife of <i>Parāvasu</i>. When <i>Raibhya</i> came home and saw what had happened, he offered in the fire two matted locks of his hair, whence sprang out a woman resembling his daughterin-law, who robbed <i>Yavakrīta</i> of his water-pot, and a <i>Rakṣas</i>, who flew at him with his uplifted spear, as he had been deprived of his water-pot and rendered unclean (<i>ucchiṣṭa</i>). <i>Yavakrīta</i> fled to a tank and then to all the rivers, and, finding them all devoid of water, he attempted to enter into the <i>agnihotra</i> room of his father, but was stopped at the door by a blind <i>śūdra</i> warder, and killed by the <i>rakṣas</i>. The <i>Rakṣas</i>, with the permission of <i>Raibhya</i>, began to live with the female (III, <b>136</b>). When <i>Bharadvāja</i> returned home, the sacrificial fires, which used to welcome him every day, did not come forward to welcome him. Having heard from the <i>śūdra</i> what had happened, he cursed <i>Raibhya</i>, saying that he should be killed by his eldest son. He cremated <i>Yavakrīta</i>, and then himself entered the fire (III, <b>137</b>). At that time king <i>Bṛhaddyumna</i>, the <i>yājya</i> of <i>Raibhya</i>, employed <i>Arvāvasu</i> and <i>Parāvasu</i> at a sacrifice, while <i>Raibhya</i> stayed at home with the wife of <i>Parāvasu</i>. One day <i>Parāvasu</i>, returning home to see his wife, met in the darkness his father in the wood wrapped in the skin of a black antelope, and, mistaking him for a deer, killed him. Then, after having performed the funeral rites of his father, he prevailed upon <i>Arvāvasu</i> to observe the vow prescribed in the case of killing a brahman, while he himself conducted the sacrifice alone. When <i>Arvāvasu</i> came back, having observed the vow, <i>Parāvasu</i> caused him to be driven away from the sacrifice as a slayer of a brahman. The <i>brahmarṣi</i> <i>Arvāvasu</i> went to the wood, and, applying to the Sun, he practised austerities and mastered the <i>Rahasyaveda</i> of the Sun. The Sun appeared to him in his embodied form, and said the gods were pleased by him. They elected <i>Arvāvasu</i> and rejected <i>Parāvasu</i>. The gods <i>Agni</i>, etc., granted him the boon that <i>Raibhya, Bharadvāja</i>, and <i>Yavakrīta</i> revived, that <i>Parāvasu</i> was absolved from his sin, that <i>Raibhya</i> did not recollect his having been slain, and that the <i>Saura Veda</i> should attain celebrity (<i>pratiṣṭhāṃ</i>). The gods explained to <i>Yavakrīta</i> that <i>Raibhya</i> had been able to kill him because he had acquired his knowledge with great exertion and in the course of a long time, while <i>Yavakrīta</i> had learnt the <i>Vedas</i> without exertion and without a <i>guru</i>. Then <i>Indra</i> and the gods returned to heaven (III, <b>138</b>)."
