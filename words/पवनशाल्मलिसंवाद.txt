One day <i>Nārada</i> praised it, saying that <i>Pavana</i> must be its friend and protector, since he spared it, though he eradicates the tallest and strongest trees (XII, <b>154</b>). The <i>śālmali</i> said that the Wind was not its friend, but that it was stronger itself than the Wind. <i>Nārada</i> warned him, saying that the Wind was stronger than even <i>Indra</i>, etc. (α) (XII, <b>155</b>). Informed by <i>Nārada</i>, the Wind came and rebuked the <i>śālmali-</i>tree, saying that he had spared it because <i>Brahmán</i>, while creating the world, had for a time rested under it. The <i>śālmali</i> laughed and challenged the Wind to show his power, which the Wind threatened to do next day. When night came the <i>śālmali</i> reflected that all that it had said to <i>Nārada</i> was false, that it was in reality weaker than other trees, and inferior in might to the Wind; “but in intelligence no tree is my equal” (XII, <b>156</b>). The <i>śālmali</i> then caused all its branches to be cut off. The Wind smiled; the <i>śālmali</i> felt great shame, and, remembering the words of <i>Nārada</i>, repented greatly of his folly."
