As the worship did not yield the desired effect, Divodāsa smashed the idol in the temple into pieces. Then Nikumbha cursed that Vārāṇasī should decline. As a result of the curse the Hehayas like Tālajaṅgha and others destroyed Vārāṇasī and drove Divodāsa away from there. At last the Nikumbha temple was rebuilt and Vārāṇasī became prosperous again."
