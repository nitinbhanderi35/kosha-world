This secret was known only to the giants, such as Rāvaṇa. and others. This Varamaṇi was kept in an underground cell of a harem near the Kālī temple in the Pātāla. <dvsn n='NI'/>The battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa was going on. Hanūmān made a fort coiling his tail like a spring and Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa stayed inside this fort. While they were sleeping, Pātāla Rāvaṇa made a tunnel under the earth and carried away Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa knew this, only next day morning. Instantly he sent Hanūmān to Pātāla. In accordance with the advice of Vibhīṣana, Hanūmān went directly to the cell in the harem, took Varamaṇi and put it in his mouth. Then he fought with Pātāla Rāvaṇa and defeated him. Thus with the help of the Varamaṇi Hanūmān rescued Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa)."
