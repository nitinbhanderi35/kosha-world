After completing the task of creation Brahmā, in his pride fell into a sleep. In order to slight Brahmā a little, Mahāviṣṇu produced two Rākṣasas called Madhu and Kaiṭabha from his ears. Hearing their terrible roar Brahmā woke up in fear and fled to Mahāviṣṇu seeking refuge. Viṣṇu called Madhu and Kaiṭabha and asked them what boon they would like to ask. They proudly replied that they would grant a boon to Viṣṇu. In that case Mahāviṣṇu wanted them to grant him leave to kill them. They answered: “We will not break our promise about granting the boon. But since our passion for fighting has not been abated, you must fulfil our eager desire.” Mahāviṣṇu said: “I agree. But let my boon be carried out first. After that I shall see that your wish is properly fulfilled. After your death, one of you will be reborn under the name of Khara and the other under the name of Atikāya. In the Tretāyuga I shall kill Khara in single combat after allaying his passion for fighting. Lakṣmaṇa who is the incarnation of Ananta will fight with Atikāya to his full satisfaction and kill him. Thus both of you will get Virakti and Mukti.” <dvsn n='NI'/>After saying this, Mahāviṣṇu made the two asuras stand on each of his thighs and killed them with his Sudarśana Cakra. They were born again as Khara and Atikāya. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Birth.</i> There is a story about the birth of Atikāya in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa: After his victory over Kubera Rāvaṇa was returning in his Puṣpaka Vimāna. On his way he saw some beautiful Gandharva women playing in the valley of Mayūragiri. Their leader was Citrāṅgī, the wife of Citrāṅgada. Rāvaṇa seduced her and had a secret union with her. At once she became pregnant and gave birth to a dazzlingly bright baby. The mother handed over the child to Rāvaṇa and returned to the world of the Gandharvas. Rāvaṇa, in his paternal love, took the child into the Vimāna and proceeded. On the way, the Vimāna knocked against a mountain peak and the baby was thrown overboard and fell in the forest. Rāvaṇa stopped the Vimāna and made a search for the baby in the forest. He found the child without the slightest injury, smiling and lying on a flat rock in the deep woods. He failed in his attempt to take it up even though he used ten of his hands. The child began to grow steadily in size. Then he tried again to lift the baby up using all his twenty arms. The boy, who had by this time grown into enormous size, suddenly sprang up and getting into the Vimāna took his seat in it. Rāvaṇa gave him the name Atikāya. On his arrival in Laṅkā, he presented him as adopted son to the barren Dhanyamālā. Atikāya was brought up by Dhanyamālā. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>The Boons.</i> Atikāya went to Gokarṇa and did penance to please Brahmā. Brahmā appeared, but being fully absorbed in Samādhi, Atikāya was not aware of his presence. Even his life-breath had been stopped. Brahmā, by his power, instilled life-breath into him and restored him to consciousness. He granted Atikāya all the boons he asked for. They were three in number. The first was the gift of Brahmāstra which could smash anyone. The second was the gift of an armour which was unassailable by anyone. The third was absence of thirst, desire and other cravings. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Education.</i> Atikāya went to Kailāsa and received his education from Śiva. He learnt all the sciences, Arts, Śruti, Smṛti etc. from there. On the completion of his course he asked what Gurudakṣiṇā he should pay. Śiva made him promise that he would never practise Black magic. Pleased with him, Śiva awarded him the Pāśupatāstra. <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Victory in Battle.</i> Atikāya had an uncle, a Rākṣasa named Candra. Once he was defeated by Indra. It was at this time of chagrin that he came to know that Atikāya had reached Laṅkā with the Pāśupatāstra. Candra Rākṣasa ordered Atikāya to bring Indra as a captive. Atikāya went to Svarga (Heaven) and began a war with Indra. Mahāviṣṇu who came to help Indra used his Sudarśana cakra. Atikāya shot his Pāśupatāstra. Knowing Atikāya's history well, Mahāviṣṇu brought the battle to a close. Both parties accepted the position that Devendra had lost the battle and Atikāya had won. <dvsn n='NI'/>6) <i>Death.</i> In the Rāmāyaṇa battle Atikāya fought on the side of Rāvaṇa. After a most terrible conflict, Lakṣmaṇa killed Atikāya. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa)."
