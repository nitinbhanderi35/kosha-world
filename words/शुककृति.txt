Then <i>Vyāsa</i> caused him to go to <i>Janaka</i>, the king of <i>Mithilā</i>, and not to the skies (by his <i>yoga</i> power); nor should he think himself superior to <i>Janaka</i>, though he was only his <i>yājya</i>. Crossing the Varṣas of <i>Meru</i> and <i>Hari</i> and <i>Himavat (Meror Hareś ca dve varṣe</i> <i>varṣaṃ Haimavatan tataḥ), Śuka</i> came to <i>Bhāratavarṣa</i>. Having seen many countries inhabited by <i>Cīnas</i> and <i>Hūṇas</i>, he reached <i>Āryāvarta</i>, and at last the country of the <i>Videhas</i>, protected by <i>Janaka</i>, and then <i>Mithilā</i>. He had not been fatigued on the way. He obtained permission to enter the city, but was at first roughly forbidden to enter the palace. At last he was admitted into the first chamber; thence he was led into the second chamber by the minister, and thence into a garden that was like a second <i>Caitraratha</i>, with damsels equal to the Aps., who entertained <i>Śuka</i> and gave him to eat; he, however, went unaffected through his rites, and in the first part of the night he devoted himself to <i>yoga</i> (XII, <b>326</b>). The next morning he was received by <i>Janaka</i>, and was instructed by him about <i>mokṣa</i> and the duties of a brahman; “ordinarily the purified understanding necessary for attaining <i>mokṣa</i> cannot be obtained without passing through all four stages of religious life; but he who in the course of many births has obtained a pure mind, may attain to <i>mokṣa</i> even in the very first stage (i.e. brahmacarya), and then there is no need for the three other stages,” quoting a saying of king <i>Yayāti</i>; “through the favour of thy father I have acquired to omniscience; thy knowledge is much greater than what you think it to be” (XII, <b>327</b>). (For continuation v. <i>Śukakṛtya</i>.)"
