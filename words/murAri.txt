This drama has eight acts. Murāri has mentioned in his works about Anaṅgaharṣa who lived in 700 A.D. and Ratnākara who lived in 750 A.D. It is therefore, surmised that Murāri must have lived during the latter part of the 8th century. In the writing of dramas Murāri has excelled the Mahāvīracarita of Bhavabhūti and his verses indicate he had the style of Māgha."
