After a hundred years of enjoyment Devahūtī gave birth to nine daughters at a time, when Kardama told her of his departure for yoga; Devahūtī requested means for protection of herself and the new-born ones; was told that Viṣṇu would be born in her womb and he would bring comfort to her. Soon she gave birth to Lord Kapila when Brahmā and other seers called on Kardama. After they left, Kardama got his daughters married, and after praising Kapila, and with his permission he went away for penance. Heard all relating to the <i>Sāṅkhya śāstra</i> from Kapila and spoke in praise of him. Following the path prescribed by Kapila she attained <i>nir-</i> <i>vāṇa.</i> The place where she attained siddhi became known as <i>Śiddhapada.</i><sup>2</sup> From her, Hari manifested Himself for imparting <i>dharma</i> and <i>jñāna.</i><sup>3</sup> <F>1) Bhā.
