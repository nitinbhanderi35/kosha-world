It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24, Verse 12, that Indra had, sitting in this chariot, killed ninetynine asuras (demons). This chariot passed hands from Indra to Uparicaravasu; from him to Bṛhadratha, and from this King to Jarāsandha, on whose death, Indra took possession of it again. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24, Verse 48)."
