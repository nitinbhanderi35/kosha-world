When <i>Vicitravīrya</i> had come of age, <i>Bhīṣma</i> went to <i>Vārāṇasī</i> to the <i>svayaṃvara</i> of the three daughters of the king of <i>Kāśi</i>, and, in order to marry them to <i>Vicitravīrya</i>, he carried them off with force to <i>Hāstinapura</i> (having defeated the other princes assembled, among these king <i>Śālva</i>, whom he conquered by means of the <i>Vāruṇa</i> and the <i>Aindra</i> weapons, but at last he left him with his life to return to his capital). The eldest, <i>Ambā</i>, he let free before the wedding, as she declared that she, in her heart, had chosen the <i>Saubha</i> king (i.e. Śālva), and had been chosen by him. <i>Ambikā</i> and <i>Ambālikā</i> he bestowed on <i>Vicitravīrya</i>. After seven years <i>Vicitravīrya</i> died of consumption (<i>yakṣman</i>) (I, <b>102</b>)."
