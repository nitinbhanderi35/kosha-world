            "content": "<b>[Kṛtaghnopākhyāna(ṃ)]</b>¦ (“the episode about an ungrateful person”). § 658<i>b</i> (Āpaddh.): <i>Bhīṣma</i> related: <i>Gautama</i>, a brahman, belonging to the middle country, devoid of <i>Vedic</i> learning, entered a village desirous of obtaining charity. In that village lived a robber (<i>dasyu</i>), possessed of great wealth, devoted to the <i>brahmans</i>, etc. He gave to <i>Gautama</i> a piece of new cloth, a widowed (<i>bhartrā virahitāṃ</i>) young woman, and a house. <i>Gautama</i> lived happily in that village of aborigines (<i>śabarālaye</i>) for many years, helping the relatives of his wife, the female slave (<i>dāsī</i>). He began to practise archery, and went into the woods and killed wild cranes (<i>cakrāṅgān</i>), etc., in abundance, and became like one of the robbers. One day a <i>brahman</i>, devoted to the study of the <i>Vedas</i>, etc., and who did never accept any food if given by a <i>Śūdra</i>, came to the house of his ancient friend <i>Gautama</i>. Seeing <i>Gautama</i>, who resembled a cannibal, he exhorted him to abandon his sinful mode of life. <i>Gautama</i>, repenting, agreed to leave this village next morning with his guest, who passed the night there, refraining touching anything (though hungry) (XII, <b>168</b>). Next morning, when the guest had left the house, <i>Gautama</i> proceeded towards the sea, having met with a caravan of merchants. The caravan was assailed by an infuriated elephant, but <i>Gautama</i> managed to escape, and fled towards the north, not knowing whither he proceeded, wandering alone in the forest like a <i>kimpuruṣa</i>. At last he reached a delightful forest, resembling the very woods of <i>Nandana</i>, and inhabited by <i>Y</i>. and <i>K.</i>, adorned with <i>Śālas</i>, etc., with <i>Bhāruṇḍas</i> (having faces resembling those of human beings), <i>Bhūliṅgas</i>, etc. Under a delightful banyan-tree (description) he fell asleep; when the sun had set, the king of cranes, <i>Nāḍījaṅgha</i> or <i>Rājadharman, Kaśyapa's</i> son, the child of a celestial maiden (<i>devakanyāsutaḥ</i>), one of the daughters of <i>Dakṣa</i> (v. 6343), and possessed of great wisdom and a friend of <i>Brahmán</i>, came home from <i>Brahmaloka</i>. Exhausted with hunger and thirst, <i>Gautama</i> thought of slaying him. <i>Nāḍījaṅgha</i> welcomed <i>Gautama</i>, and asked him to stay with him till the next morning (XII, <b>169</b>). He, who equalled <i>Yama</i> himself in his knowledge of duties, made for him a bed of the <i>śāla</i> flowers, and offered him large fishes from the <i>Bhāgīrathī</i>, etc. Learning that he was desirous of going to the sea in order to earn wealth, he, quoting <i>Bṛhaspati</i> as to the fourfold means of earning wealth, directed him in the morning to his friend, the chief of the <i>Rākṣasas, Virūpākṣa</i>, about 3 <i>yojanas</i> away. <i>Gautama</i> reached the city of <i>Meruvraja</i> (description), and was welcomed by <i>Virūpākṣa</i> (XII, <b>170</b>). Though not satisfied with <i>Gautama's</i> antecedents, <i>Virūpākṣa</i>, because <i>Gautama</i> was a brahman, and for the sake of <i>Rāja-</i> <i>dharman</i>, entertained him with the 1,000 <i>brahmans</i> that were to be entertained in his house on the day of full moon of the <i>Kārttika</i> month (description). Some amongst them were selected to represent the V.-D., P., and the deities of fire. This he did every year on the <i>Āṣāḍhī</i> and <i>Māghī</i>, and especially on the <i>Kārttikī</i>, after the expiry of the autumn, giving away gold, jewels, etc.; on this one day there was no fear of <i>Rā</i>. <i>Gautama</i> came away with much wealth, and returned to <i>Rājadharman</i>, who welcomed him. Having no food to live on by the way, he thought of slaying <i>Rājadharman</i> (XII, <b>170</b>). This he did; having plucked off the feathers and the down, he roasted the flesh, and taking it up together with the gold he had brought, he quickly fled from the spot. The next day <i>Virūpākṣa</i> became anxious because he had not for two mornings and two nights seen <i>Rājadharman</i>, who when returning from <i>Brahmaloka</i> every morning never went home without paying him a visit; he suspected that <i>Gautama</i> had slain him, and sent his son with other Rā. to inquire after him. <i>Gautama</i> was caught and brought to <i>Meruvraja</i>; as the Rā. refused to eat the flesh of that great sinner, he was hacked into pieces, which were given away to the robbers. But the very robbers, though cannibals, refused to eat the flesh of that vile man (XII, <b>172</b>). <i>Virūpākṣa</i> caused a funeral pyre, etc., to be made for <i>Rājadharman</i>. At that time the goddess <i>Surabhi</i>, the daughter of <i>Dakṣa</i>, appeared in the sky above the pyre; from her mouth froth mixed with milk fell upon the funeral pyre, and <i>Rājadharman</i> became revived. <i>Indra</i> came and related that once <i>Rājadharman</i> had absented himself from <i>Brahmaloka</i> and was cursed by <i>Brahmán</i>, who said that he should not die soon; “therefore he has come back to life.” Asked by <i>Rājadharman</i> on behalf of his “dear friend <i>Gautama</i>”, <i>Indra</i> sprinkled <i>amṛta</i> over <i>Gautama</i>, and restored him to life. <i>Rājadharman</i> embraced him with great joy, dismissed him with his wealth, and returned home. At the due hour he repaired to <i>Brahmaloka</i> and was honoured by <i>Brahmán. Gautama</i> begot many sinful children upon his <i>Śūdrā</i> wife. According to a heavy curse denounced upon him by the gods, he afterwards had to sink into a terrible hell for many years. “All this was recited to me formerly by Nārada.”"
