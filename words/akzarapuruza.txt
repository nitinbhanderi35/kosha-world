Śrī Kṛṣṇa then through the famous Gītā enunciated a philosophy of life during the course of which he speaks about the two puruṣas, Kṣara and Aksara. All that we see in this world and enjoy are Kṣara and the power behind all of them is Akṣara. God is one who transcends the aspects Kṣara and Akṣara and stands as the root cause of all life. (Ślokas 16 to 19, Chapter 39, Bhīṣma Parva, M.B.)"
