            "content": "MARĪCI I¦. A Maharṣi (sage) born from Brahmā's mind. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Birth and Genealogy.</i> The six great sages born from Brahmā's mind were:—Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu, according to Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Domestic life.</i> Marīci had several wives and children. He married Kalā, the daughter of Kardama Prajāpati by his wife Devahūti. Marīci had two sons Kaśyapa and Pūrṇiman by Kalā. This Kaśyapa was the original ancestor of all living beings. But Pūrṇiman's family did not become well-known. Pūrṇiman had two sons, Virajas and Viśvaga and a daughter Devakulyā. Devakulyā washed the feet of Mahāviṣṇu and merged with Ākāśa Gaṅgā. <dvsn n='NI'/>Ūrṇā was another wife of Marīci. Six sons were born to Ūrṇā. Under a curse of Brahmā they were born first as the sons of Hiraṇyakaśipu and in their next birth as the sons of Vasudeva and Devakī. It was these six children who were born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa's elder brothers whom Kaṃsa killed immediately after their birth. (See under Kṛṣṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Marīci had another wife named Sambhūti. She gave birth to Paurṇamāsa. In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter 10, we see that Paurṇamāsa who was a Mahātmā had two sons Virajas and Parvata. Dharmavratā was yet another wife of Marīci. She was a daughter born to Dharmavatī by Dharmadeva. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Dharmavratā cursed.</i> Marīci lived happily for long with his wife Dharmavratā. Once he returned from the forest, carrying darbha grass, flowers etc. He was tired after a long walk. After taking food, he wanted his wife to massage his legs. While she was massaging him Marīci fell asleep. Just then Brahmā happened to come there. Dharmavratā was in a fix. She had to attend to her husband and at the same time receive Brahmā with due respect. She could not leave her husband's guru (Sire). It was her duty to honour him properly. <dvsn n='NI'/>At last she got up and welcomed Brahmā, offering him the customary honours. Meanwhile Marīci woke up and not finding his wife near him cursed her to be turned into a stone. Dharmavratā who was distressed at the curse pleaded innocence and explained to him that she had been honouring his guru. She warned him that he would incur the curse of Śiva. <dvsn n='NI'/>Under Marīci's curse Dharmavratā was separated from him. She performed penance in the midst of fires. Mahāviṣṇu appeared before her and asked her what boon she wanted. She prayed that her curse might be lifted. Viṣṇu replied:—“It was Marīci who cursed you. That curse cannot be withdrawn. You will be turned into a sacred stone. Your name “Dharmavratā” will be changed into “Devavratā”. In future, that stone will become famous under the name “Devavratā” or “Devaśilā”. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara and goddesses like Lakṣmī will dwell in that stone.” <dvsn n='NI'/>After saying this, Mahāviṣṇu disappeared. Once Dharmadeva held this Devaśilā above the demon Gaya and the place became famous under the name of “Gayā tīrtha”. (See under Gayātīrtha). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Marīci had participated in the celebration connected with Arjuna's birth. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 52). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Marīci was a member of Indra's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 17). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Marīci attended the celebration connected with Subrahmaṇya's birth. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 10). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) After the Bhārata Yuddha, Marīci visited Bhīṣma who was lying on “Śara Śayyā” (bed of arrows). (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 47, Verse 10). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 334, Verse 35, mentions that Marīci is a Prajāpati. <dvsn n='NI'/>(vi) Marīci is one of the group of sages known as Citraśikhaṇḍins. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 335, Verse 29). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vii) Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 340, Verse 44, describes Marīci as one of the Aṣṭaprakṛtis. <dvsn n='NI'/>(viii) Marīci once visited Dhruva who was performing penance and gave him advice. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter 11)."
