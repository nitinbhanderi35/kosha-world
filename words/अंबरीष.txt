Though lord of seven continents, Ambarīṣa knew that glory was perishable. He devoted himself to the service of Hari, and got to know the power of His <i>yoga.</i> A saintly king. Performed the <i>Aśvamedha</i> in a desert region so as to compel R. Sarasvati flow back towards it. Pleased with him, Hari presented his <i>Cakra</i> to him. He observed the <i>Dvādasī</i> <i>vrata,</i> for a year at the end of which he gave gifts to Brāhmaṇas and was preparing to feed them. There then came Durvāsas who agreed to be fed. He went to the Yamunā for bath and was engaged in contemplating on Brahman. The time for breakfast came and the sage did not return. So the king broke his fast with only water and waited food expecting the sage's arrival. The sage on his return found that the king had broken his fast, and grew angry and created a flaming goddess to attack him. Hari's <i>Cakra</i> burnt her, turned towards the sage who ran everywhere and to the <i>Trimūrtis</i> in vain.<sup>1</sup> Advised by Hari, the sage apologised to the king who prayed to the <i>Cakra</i> and set the sage at liberty. The king who had not taken food requested him to accept his hospitality which Durvāsas gladly did. Blessing the king, the sage went back to Brahmaloka. Later the king bestowed his kingdom on his sons and retired to the forest for a life of penance and prayer.<sup>2</sup> Had three sons Virūpa and others.<sup>3</sup> A <i>mantrakṛt</i> who made the 16 great gifts.<sup>4</sup> <F>1) Bhā.
