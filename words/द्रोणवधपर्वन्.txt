Droṇavadha). § 601: CONTINUATION OF THE NIGHT AFTER THE FOURTEENTH DAY: According to the words of <i>Vyāsa</i>, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> refrained from himself seeking to slay <i>Karṇa</i>, but was filled with grief and anger because <i>Karṇa</i> had slain <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>. Beholding the <i>Kurus</i> held in check by <i>Bhīma</i>, he told <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (α), to attack <i>Droṇa</i>, who received them; <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., came to <i>Droṇa's</i> rescue; a fierce battle ensued between the two hosts; both armies became sorely afflicted with fatigue and blind with sleep. <i>Arjuna</i> granted permission to the warriors to sleep. D., Ṛ., and the soldiers applauded <i>Arjuna</i>; the <i>Kurus</i> asked <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> to abstain from the fight; all the combatants laid themselves down on the field to sleep (description); the <i>Kaurava</i> troops blessed <i>Arjuna</i> for his act of kindness. When the moon rose, both hosts, rising from sleep, again prepared for battle (VII, <b>184</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> taxed <i>Droṇa</i> wrathfully for his kindness to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (β); <i>Droṇa</i> in wrath promised to slay all the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, and described the measure of <i>Arjuna's</i> might and prowess (γ). <i>Duryodhana</i> vowed that he, etc. (δ), that very day would slay <i>Arjuna</i>, dividing the <i>Bharata</i> host into two divisions. <i>Droṇa</i> ridiculed <i>Duryodhana</i> (ε), saying that it was only right that <i>Duryodhana</i> or <i>Śakuni</i>, who were the root of the hostility, should proceed against <i>Arjuna</i>, instead of causing all the unoffending <i>Kṣatriyas</i> to be slain, and that he should accomplish his boasting vow before <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra</i>, and that he and <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duḥśāsana</i> would slay the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; moreover, he had done all in life that one should do. The army then was divided into two bodies, and the battle commenced (VII, <b>185</b>).—§ 602: THE FIFTEENTH DAY: When three-quarters of that night had worn away, the battle once more commenced. At sunrise both hosts, alighting from their chariots, etc., uttered the prayers of the twilight. After the <i>Kuru</i> army had been divided into two bodies, <i>Droṇa</i>, with <i>Duryodhana</i> before him, proceeded against the <i>Somakas</i>, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and the <i>Pāñcālas</i>. Urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna</i> moved to the left of <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>. <i>Bhīma</i> urged <i>Arjuna</i> to put forth all his vigour. <i>Arjuna</i> <i>& Droṇa & Karṇa</i>, etc. (ζ) (description). <i>Droṇa</i> moved away towards the north; the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops began to tremble; the <i>Pāñcālas & Droṇa; Drupada</i> and <i>Virāṭa</i> + the three grandsons of <i>Drupada</i> + the <i>Cedis & Droṇa</i>, who slew the three grandsons of <i>Drupada</i>, vanquished the <i>Cedis</i>, etc. (η), and slew <i>Drupada</i> and <i>Virāṭa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> swore to slay <i>Droṇa</i> that very day; <i>Drupada</i> with his division (from one side) + <i>Arjuna</i> (from another side) & <i>Droṇa + Duryo-</i> <i>dhaṇa</i>, etc. (θ); <i>Bhīma</i> urged <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, and they both attacked <i>Droṇa's</i> division (description); soon the morning sun arose (VII, <b>186</b>). The warriors adored the Sun, as he rose, and the battle once more commenced (description); neither <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (ι), could be seen for dust. <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (κ), engaged in battle with four of the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> warriors: <i>Duryodhana</i> + his brothers & <i>Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva; Karṇa</i> <i>& Bhīma; Droṇa & Arjuna; Nakula</i> was worsted by <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i> (VII, <b>187</b>); <i>Sahadeva</i> slew <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> driver; <i>Duḥśāsana</i> was worsted by <i>Sahadeva; Bhīma</i> jumped into the chariot of <i>Nakula; Droṇa</i> invoked the <i>Aindra</i>, etc. (λ), weapons; D., G., Ṛ., Si., Aps., Y., and Rā. applauded <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, saying that “this is no human, etc. (μ), but a high <i>Brāhma</i> encounter”; both employed the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon; the engagement became general (VII, <b>188</b>). <i>Duḥśāsana &</i> <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, who vanquished him and proceeded against <i>Droṇa. Kṛtavarman</i> + three of his brothers & <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna + Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i>, who checked them (enumeration of unfair weapons that were not used); <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> proceeded towards <i>Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna +</i> <i>Sātyaki & Droṇa + Duryodhana</i> (who grieved on account of his former friendship with <i>Sātyaki</i>); <i>Duryodhana</i> was worsted by <i>Sātyaki; Karṇa</i> rushed to the rescue of <i>Duryodhana; Bhīma</i> rushed towards <i>Karṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> urged his warriors to rush to the rescue of <i>Sātyaki, Bhīma</i>, and the twins; <i>Arjuna</i> attacked the <i>Kurus</i>, and <i>Droṇa</i> attacked the <i>Pāñcālas</i> (VII, <b>189</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> caused a great carnage among the <i>Pāñcālas</i>; the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Sṛñjayas & Droṇa</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> feared, thinking that <i>Arjuna</i> would not fight with <i>Droṇa. Kṛṣṇa</i> told <i>Arjuna</i> to abandon virtue and let some man tell <i>Droṇa</i> that <i>Aśvatthāman</i> had been slain in battle. <i>Arjuna</i> did not approve of it; others approved of it, but <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with great difficulty. <i>Bhīma</i> slew with a mace an elephant named <i>Aśvatthāman</i> belonging to the <i>Mālava</i> chief <i>Indravarman</i>, and exclaimed before <i>Droṇa</i>: “<i>Aśvatthāman</i> has been slain.” <i>Droṇa</i> did not believe <i>Bhīma</i>, but attacked <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and slew the <i>Pāñcālas</i> (and <i>Somakas</i>) with the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, and cut off the head of <i>Vasudāna</i>, and slew 500 <i>Matsyas</i>, etc. The Ṛ. <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, etc., etc. (ν), appeared in the welkin and reproved <i>Droṇa</i> for using the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon against persons not acquainted with it, and called upon <i>Droṇa</i> to lay aside his weapons and leave the earth soon. <i>Droṇa</i> asked <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> whether the report about <i>Aśvatthā-</i> <i>man's</i> death was true; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> urged <i>Yudhiṣṭhra</i> to save his army by an untruth; <i>Bhīma</i> urged him to do the same; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> distinctly said that <i>Aśvatthāman</i> was dead, adding indistinctly the word “elephant”; before this <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira's</i> chariot had stayed at a height of four fingers' breadth from the surface of the earth; after this untruth his animals touched the earth. <i>Droṇa</i> became quite dejected, also after the words of the Ṛ., and beholding <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> before him, could not fight as before (VII, <b>190</b>). <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna & Droṇa</i>; the celestial weapons no longer appeared at <i>Droṇa's</i> bidding; his weapons, that had not been exhausted for four days and one night, now became exhausted on the third part of the fifth day. <i>Droṇa</i> took up another celestial bow which <i>Aṅgiras</i> had given him; a fierce encounter took place between <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>; none else had arrows of that kind that <i>Droṇa</i> used in close fight except <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc. (ξ); <i>Sātyaki</i> rescued <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and was applauded by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, and the Si., etc. (VII, <b>191</b>). <i>Duryodhana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Kṛpa + Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> sons <i>& Sātyaki + Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ο); <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> urged his troops against <i>Droṇa</i> (in order to aid <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>), who again used the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon; <i>Bhīma</i> took up <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> on his own chariot, and urged him to slay <i>Droṇa</i> quickly; both <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and <i>Droṇa</i> invoked the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, etc.: <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> began to slay the <i>Vaśātis</i>, etc. (π); <i>Bhīma</i> again reminded <i>Droṇa</i> of <i>Aśvatthāman's</i> death, calling upon <i>Karṇa, Kṛpa</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i> to exert carefully in battle. <i>Droṇa</i> laid his weapons aside, devoted himself to <i>yoga</i>, and proceeded to heaven (<i>Brahmaloka</i>) in the company of the foremost of Ṛ., in a blaze of light, that only <i>Sañjaya</i>, etc. (ρ), saw; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> cut off <i>Droṇa's</i> head—though forbidden by <i>Arjuna</i> and blamed by everybody—and threw it down amongst the <i>Kurus</i>, who ran away in all directions, except <i>Aśvatthāman. Sañjaya</i>, through the grace of <i>Vyāsa</i>, beheld <i>Droṇa's</i> proceeding after he had ascended the sky. The <i>Kurus</i>, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and the <i>Sṛñjayas</i> all became dejected and ran away; <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> embraced each other, <i>Bhīmasena</i> expecting the slaughter of <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> (VII, <b>192</b>)."
