Bhandarkar mentions them to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇapatināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudragupta) in Vidiśā.<sup>521</sup> So his view seems to be inconsistent. <dvsn n='P'/>It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.<sup>522</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks like a foreign name’;<sup>523</sup> but his father bears a purely Hindu name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is illegible in the inscription (No. 3).<sup>524</sup> But considering the trend it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.<sup>525</sup> It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit culture."
