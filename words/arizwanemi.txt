Śukī was their daughter, Śukī had a daughter Natā and she a daughter, Vinatā. Ariṣṭanemi, Tārkṣya, Aruṇa, Garuḍa, Para, Āruṇi and Śrī Vāruṇi were the children of Vinatā. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 40). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Tapaśśakti of Ariṣṭanemi.</i> Ariṣṭanemi with his son was once performing tapas in the forest. The son was immersed in meditation clad in the skin of a deer thus looking like a deer. Parapurañjaya, the King of Hehaya who happened at the time to be hunting in the forest discharged his arrow against the son of Ariṣṭanemi taking him for a deer. When the king found out the real fact he felt extremely sorry, and he craved pardon of the boy's father for unwittingly killing his son. Then Ariṣṭanemi pointing out his son who was standing alive asked the King, “Is this the boy whom you killed?” The King was naturally wonder-struck. But Ariṣṭanemi told the King that there was nothing to wonder at in the case as nobody would be able to kill them because their Tapaśśakti was so great. The King felt so happy at this, and returned to his palace after prostrating at the feet of the sage. (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapter 184). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Some other details.</i> (1) Sumati, wife of King Sagara of the Solar dynasty, was the daughter of Ariṣṭanemi. (Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 38, Verse 4). (2) Kaśyapa had the synonym Ariṣṭanemi also. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhākāṇḍa, Canto 66, Verse 4; Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama Skandha). (3) Ariṣṭanemi's wives delivered sixteen children. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19). (4) Ariṣṭanemi has spoken a lot about the greatness of Brahmins. (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapter 184, Verses 17-22). (5) Ariṣṭanemi once gave much spiritual advice to King Sagara of the Sūrya Vaṃśa. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 288, Verses 5-46)."

Indra who was very much pleased at this sent a messenger with a vimāna (aeroplane) to conduct the King to Svarga (heaven). When he was told that there was in Svarga also the states of being high or low, and fall happened when the effect of good actions decreased, the King gave up his desire for Svarga and sent back Indra's messenger. Then Indra sent the King with a messenger to the Āśrama of Vālmīki so that he might gain spiritual knowledge. Vālmīki consoled the King with the advice that the telling, hearing and pondering over the story of the Rāmāyaṇa alone would be enough to get eternal salvation. (Yogavāsiṣṭham)."
