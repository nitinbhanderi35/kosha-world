It was here, at Citrakūṭa that Śrī Rāma, Sītā and others lived for a period of time. It is said that Rājalakṣmī (royal wealth and welfare) will embrace those who fast on the Citrakūṭa after a bath in the Mandākinī. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 26, Verse 29). This mountain is in Bāndā Zilla of the U.P. in modern India. <dvsn n='NI'/>Citrakūṭa is described in Cantos 56 and 94 of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa."
