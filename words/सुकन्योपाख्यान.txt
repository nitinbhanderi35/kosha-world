The <i>viprarṣi Cyavana</i>, seeing <i>Sukanyā</i>, was gladdened and spoke to her, but she did not hear him. Then <i>Sukanyā</i>, seeing his eyes in the anthill, pierced them with thorns from curiosity. He, becoming very angry, obstructed the excrements and urine of <i>Śaryāti's</i> soldiers, and <i>Śaryāti</i> at last discovered the cause of their distress, and only obtained deliverance therefrom by bestowing <i>Sukanyā</i> upon <i>Cyavana</i>. Then <i>Śaryāti</i>, with his troops, went to his city, and <i>Sukanyā</i> remained with <i>Cyavana</i> (III, <b>122</b>). Once, when the <i>Aśvins</i> had seen <i>Sukanyā</i>, after she had bathed, they asked her to choose one of them for her husband, and as she refused, they entered the water together with <i>Cyavana</i>, and when they all came out of the tank young and beautiful they asked her to choose one of them and she choose <i>Cyavana. Cyavana</i> promised them to make them drinkers of <i>soma</i> in the presence of <i>Indra</i>. Then the <i>Aśvins</i>, highly delighted, ascended to heaven (III, <b>123</b>). When <i>Śaryāti</i> heard that <i>Cyavana</i> had been turned into a youth, he came with his wife and troops to see him, and became very glad. <i>Cyavana</i> caused him to perform a sacrifice with <i>Cyavana</i> as his priest. When <i>Cyavana</i> was about to take up <i>soma</i> in order to offer it to the <i>Aśvins, Indra</i> forbade it, saying, that they were physicians and servants, assumed forms at pleasure, and roamed about in the world of mortals, and as <i>Cyavana</i> did not obey he prepared to hurl his thunderbolt at him, but <i>Cyavana</i> paralysed his arm and fulfilled his intention. Then he created a <i>kṛtyā</i>, a great <i>Asura</i> named <i>Mada</i> (description); this rushed forth to devour <i>Indra</i> (III, <b>124</b>), who only was delivered when he had sanctioned that the <i>Aśvins</i> should henceforth be entitled to the <i>soma</i> juice, saying that he had only intended to spread the fame of <i>Cyavana</i> and <i>Śaryāti. Cyavana</i> distributed <i>Mada</i> (who had been created repeatedly before) in drinks, women, gambling, and hunting."
