There is a story in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa about the birth of Revatī. <dvsn n='NI'/>A son was born to the hermit Ṛtavāk on Revatī day. <dvsn n='NI'/>By and by he became wicked. Having learned from the hermit Garga that his son became wicked because he was born under the star Revatī, Ṛtavāk cursed the star Revatī and kicked it down from its place. The spot on which the star fell became a lake. After a time a beautiful damsel was born from the lake. The hermit Pramuca took the girl home and brought her up. She was called Revatī. When she came of age, she was given in marriage to Durgama, the son of king Vikramaśīla. At the request of Revatī her marriage was conducted at an auspicious moment on the day of the star Revatī. The hermit blessed the couple “Let a son, who would become the Lord of the Manvantara, be born to you.” As a result of this blessing the bright and valiant son Raivata was born to them. This Raivata was the Lord of the fifth Manvantara."
