We also find his name in the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa (A.D. 500-515).<sup>20</sup> Mātṛ stands for one of the seven Mātṛkās<sup>21</sup> and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The name is formed by the similar process of the combination of the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant to the context."
