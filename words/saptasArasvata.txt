Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 37, Verse 61, that during his pilgrimage Balabhadrarāma visited this holy bath. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Origin.</i> A story occurs in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 38 about the origin of this tīrtha. It is given below:— <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Brahmā performed a sacrifice on the island of Puṣkara. All the devas (gods and goddesses) attended the sacrifice. Among the rivers, Sarasvatī alone did not come at first. Then Brahmā remembered Sarasvatī and she appeared under the name Suprabhā. Thus she appeared before the hermits who were doing penance in that place assuming seven different figures. From that day onwards the place became famous under the name Saptasārasvata. (See under Sarasvatī)."
