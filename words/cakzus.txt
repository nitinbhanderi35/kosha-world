Starting from Viṣṇupāda (Svarga) the Gaṅgā falls into Devayāna and thence into the moon and after flooding the whole area it divides itself into four tributaries, viz., Sītā, Cakṣus, Alakanandā and Bhadrā and falls into Brahmaloka and flows in four directions. Of the four tributaries the river called Cakṣus falls on the peak of Mount Mālyavān and then flows through Ketumāla and falls into the western sea. The Gaṅgā which flows through India is a branch of the above-mentioned tributary, Alakanandā. (Devī Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha)."
