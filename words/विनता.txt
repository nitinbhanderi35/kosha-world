            "content": "<b>Vinatā</b>¦ f.: A mythical female being. <b>A.</b> Family: One of the two daughters of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1), both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59. 12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24. <b>B.</b> Description: Divine (<i>devī</i>) 1. 14. 15; beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5; shining (<i>śubhā,</i> also 1. 14. 5), auspicious (<i>kalyāṇī</i>) and famous (<i>yaśasvinī</i>) 1. 27. 24. <b>C.</b> Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband, granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose to have two sons, stronger than the sons of Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a half sons as desired (<i>? adhyardhaṃ putram</i> <i>īpsitam</i> 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that one of her two sons was not fully developed ? 1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said “so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 610; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs which were preserved for five hundred years in warm pots by the female attendants (<i>sopasvedeṣu bhāṇḍeṣu</i> 1. 14. 13; Nī. <i>sopas-</i> <i>vedeṣu uṣmavatsu</i> on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.); when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons came out of the eggs but nothing came out of the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and desirous of quickly having a son, broke one of the two eggs and saw her partly developed son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also 1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the slave (<i>dāsī</i> 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she vied; he also told the mother that her second son will free her from slavery if she did not break the other egg prematurely and produce a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was born at proper time; as soon as born he left Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1. 26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son, practised penance and observed vows; having bathed and become pure she approached her husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would succeed and that she would give birth to heroic sons; he also told her to carefully bear the <i>garbha;</i> Vinatā delighted when thus addressed by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa and Garuḍa called <i>vainateyau</i> ‘sons of Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas and the conception of Kaśyapa (<i>tapasā vāla-</i> <i>khilyānāṃ mama saṃkalpajau tathā / bha-</i> <i>viṣyato mahābhāgau putrau te lokapūjitau</i>) 1. 27. 27; 1. 27. 1-2; besides Aruṇa and Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi also called <i>vainateyāḥ</i> 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62 (with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending from her (<i>vinatākula</i>), of noble family, propagated by Garuḍa through his six sons 5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya<sup>1</sup>]. <b>D.</b> Slave of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥśravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse; Vinatā declared it to be white and asked Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then went home agreeing to inspect the horse the next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1. 19. 1-3; when they found that there were many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas, Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who lost the bet and was defeated was grieved to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1. 20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the <i>nāgas</i> in the middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as commanded and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother, carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must act as told by the serpents; Vinatā informed him that she having lost the wager had become the slave of her sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa how he (and his mother) could be free from slavery, told him to get <i>amṛta</i> for them to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12; Garuḍa got ready to fetch <i>amṛta</i> and asked Vinatā what he might eat on way; Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean (<i>samudrakukṣāv ekānte</i> 1. 24. 2), and warned him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3; on being further asked by Garuḍa how he could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him: “who, when swallowed, burns your throat like a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāhmaṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him as follows: “May Wind protect your wings, Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun the whole of you; myself shall always endeavour for your comfort and well-being (<i>śānti-</i> <i>svastiparāyaṇā</i> 1. 24. 9); may your path be free from obstacles and may you succeed in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa met his father and told him that he was on his way to fetch <i>soma</i> in order to free his mother from slavery; he also told him that he was asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was not satisfied even after eating thousands of them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in getting <i>soma (amṛta)</i> he approached his mother and told the serpents that since he was leaving the <i>amṛta</i> for them on <i>kuśa</i> grass his mother should be freed from slavery from that day; the serpents said: “so be it”; Garuḍa then roamed in the forest with his mother Vinatā and gave delight to her 1. 30. 14-17, 21. <b>E.</b> Functions: Vinatā is one of those (like Surasā, Surabhi and many others) who wait upon Pitāmaha in his <i>sabhā</i> 2. 11. 29, 31. <b>F.</b> Svāhā identified with Vinatā ?: Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa (3. 213. 50) while getting away with the seed of Agni assumed the form of a female Garuḍa (<i>garuḍī</i>), a female Suparṇa (<i>suparṇī</i>) to escape identification 3. 214. 7-10); 3. 215. 3; Svāhā as Vinatā (as Suparṇī 3. 215. 4) told Skanda that he was her son qualified to give her the <i>śrāddha</i> oblation (<i>mama tvaṃ piṇḍa-</i> <i>daḥ sutaḥ</i>) 3. 219. 12; as one of the mothers of Skanka, Vinatā, highly ferocious, assumes the form of a <i>śikunigraha</i> (bird-affliction ?) to torment young children until they are sixteen years old 3. 219. 26, 22, 41."
