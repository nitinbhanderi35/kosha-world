Coming to know of this on his return, the sage produced a flaming spirit to attack him. But Hari's <i>cakra</i> burnt it down and turned towards the sage, who ran for succour to Brahmā, Śiva and Viṣṇu. All of them were unable to help; but Hari advised him to meet Ambarīṣa and apologise to him.<sup>3</sup> This he did and was set at liberty. After partaking the meals with him, he returned to Brahmaloka;<sup>4</sup> blessed Pṛtha with secret <i>mantras</i> to summon gods.<sup>5</sup> Through him Duryodhana planned to destroy the Pāṇḍavas by inciting him to go to them and ask for a feast. But Kṛṣṇa protected them on the occasion.<sup>6</sup> In the course of his sojourn he met a Vidyādhara maid with a garland given to her by the Devī; took it from her and presented it to Indra who put it on his elephant, who in turn threw it on the ground and trampled upon it. Enraged at this, the sage cursed him to be lost to all fortune.<sup>7</sup> <F>1) Bhā. IV. 1. 15; Br. III. 8. 82; Vā. 70. 76.</F> <F>2) Bhā. IV. 1. 33.</F> <F>3) Ib. IX. 4. 35-71.</F> <F>4) Ib.
