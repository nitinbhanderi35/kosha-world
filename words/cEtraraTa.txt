(Śloka 48, Chapter 118, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>As a support to the great mountain Mahāmeru were four mountains, Mandara, Merumandara, Supārśva and Kumuda. Above each of these was a garden-wood, Nandana, Caitraratha, Vaibhrājaka and Sarvatobhadra. Thus it is to be presumed that Caitraratha was on Merumandara. (Chapter 16, Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata)."
