It is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> In the latter text it is said that the middle of the earth is only a span (<b>Prādeśa</b>) to the north of it. In the Rigveda Sūtras<sup>3</sup> the locality is called Plākṣa Prasravaṇa, and is apparently meant to designate the source of the Sarasvatī rather than the place of its reappearance. <F>1) xxv. 10, 16. 22; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 7; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 17, 12. 14.</F> <F>2) iv. 26, 12.</F> <F>3) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 6, 1; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29, 24. <dvsn n='P'/><i>Cf.</i> Hopkins, <i>Transactions of the Con-</i> <i>necticut Academy of Arts and Sciences,</i> 15, 31, n. 2.</F>"
