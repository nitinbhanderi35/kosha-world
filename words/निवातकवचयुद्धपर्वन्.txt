Arjuna</i> then gave to <i>Draupadī</i> precious gems, etc., presented to him by <i>Indra</i>. Then he related all as it had happened, and slept that night with the two sons of <i>Mādrī</i> (III, <b>165</b>). The next morning <i>Indra</i> visited them under the sound of musical instruments, etc., and blessed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and advised him to repair to <i>Kāmyaka</i>. Blessing upon the reader (III, <b>166</b>).—§ 442: When <i>Indra</i> had gone, <i>Arjuna</i> related his journey from <i>Kāmyaka</i> (see §§ 330—3), etc. (of mountains he mentioned only <i>Bhṛgutuṅga</i>, where he spent one night and subsequently saw the brahman; then <i>Himavat</i>, where the meeting with the <i>Kirāta</i> took place on the first day of the fifth month after the beginning of his penances; the <i>Kirāta</i> multiplied a hundredfold and a thousandfold, and was transformed in various manners; <i>Arjuna</i> in vain employed the <i>Vāyavya, Sthūṇākarṇa</i> (see Nīl.), <i>Jāla</i> (i.e. <i>Vāruṇa</i>, Nīl.), and the <i>Śalabhāstra</i>, and showers of shafts and stones, as the <i>Kirāta</i> swallowed them up all; <i>Arjuna</i> in vain discharged the <i>Brahmāstra</i>) (III, <b>167</b>).—§ 443: <i>Arjuna</i> continued his narrative (see §§ 334—7): he passed the night after the meeting with the <i>Kirāta</i> at that place, and in the morning he saw again the same brahman (= <i>Indra</i>), and in the evening he had the visit of the <i>Lokapālas</i>; the weapons that <i>Indra</i> promised to teach him were: those of <i>Vāyu, Agni</i>, the <i>Vasus, Varuṇa</i>, the <i>Maruts</i>, the <i>Sādhya</i> and <i>Paitāmaha</i> weapons, those of the <i>Gandharvas, Uragas</i> (i.e. Snakes), and <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and all the <i>Vaiṣṇava</i> and <i>Nairṛta</i> weapons [v. 12020 foll.]; in the chariot of <i>Indra, Mātali</i> wondered that <i>Arjuna</i> was not jerked, though <i>Indra</i> always himself gets jerked at the first pull by the steeds [v. 12030]; when he had learnt the weapons, <i>Indra</i> said that now even the gods could not conquer him (v. 12054); he had received knowledge of fifteen weapons with five modes of using them, viz. <i>Prayoga</i> [discharge], <i>upasaṃhāra</i> [withdrawal], <i>āvṛtti</i> [redischarge], <i>prāyaścitta</i> [revival of harmless beings slain by any weapon, PCR., Nīl.], and <i>pratighāta</i> [revival of weapons baffled by those of the enemies, PCR., Nīl.] (vv. 12058—9); <i>Indra</i> asked him, as his fee, to slay the <i>Nivātakavacas</i>, who were thirty millions (<i>tisraḥ koṭyaḥ</i>) in number and dwelt in the ocean, and gave him the chariot (conducted by <i>Mātali</i>), upon which he (<i>Indra</i>) had vanquished <i>Bali</i> (<i>Baliṃ</i> <i>Vairocaniṃ</i>, v. 12068), <i>Śambara, Bala, Vṛtra, Prahlāda</i>, and <i>Naraka</i>, and millions of <i>Daityas</i>, and “this” diadem, and ornaments like his own, and the impenetrable mail, and fastened “this” durable (<i>ajarāṃ</i>) string to the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>, and the gods gave him the shell <i>Devadatta</i>, through which <i>Indra</i> had conquered the worlds (cf. § 446) (III, <b>168</b>).—§ 444: <i>Arjuna</i> continued: When he came to the ocean, he saw at a short distance the <i>Daitya</i> city filled with <i>Dānavas. Mātali</i> drove the chariot with force, and the <i>Dānavas</i> shut the gates. Then <i>Arjuna</i> blew the <i>Devadatta</i>, and the <i>Nivātakavacas</i> appeared with iron javelins, maces, clubs, hatchets, sabres, discs, <i>śataghnīs, bhuśuṇḍīs</i>, and swords, and sounded dissonant musical instruments. The <i>Devarṣis</i>, the <i>Dānavarṣis</i>, the <i>Brahmarṣis</i>, and the <i>Siddhas</i> came to the battle (III, <b>169</b>). With arrows inspired with <i>mantras</i> relating to the <i>Brahman-</i> weapon (<i>Brahmāstraparimantritaiḥ</i>), then with the <i>Mādhava</i> (PCR. Māghava) weapon and the <i>Gāṇḍīva Arjuna</i> killed innumerable <i>Nivātakavacas</i>, and the 10,000 horses yoked at the chariot conducted by <i>Mātali</i> trampled upon them (III, <b>170</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> reduced a shower of crags to powder by the <i>Mahendra</i> weapon, then dried up showers of water by the weapon <i>Viśoṣana</i>, that he had acquired from <i>Indra</i>; then he annihilated fire by the water weapon (<i>salilāstra</i>), and by the stone weapon (<i>śailena mahāstreṇa</i>) he repeatedly resisted the wind. Then darkness enveloped the world; the steeds turned away, <i>Mātali</i> fell off, and the golden lash fell from his hand; as <i>Mātali</i> was stupefied, a terrible fear seized <i>Arjuna; Mātali</i> said that he had conducted <i>Indra's</i> chariot in the battle for the sake of nectar, and in the battles with <i>Śambara, Vṛtra, Vairocani</i>, etc., but never had he lost his senses before. <i>Arjuna</i> comforted <i>Mātali</i> and repeatedly frustrated the magic of the enemy, and <i>Mātali</i> again conducted the chariot. Then on a sudden <i>Arjuna</i> did not see the <i>Dānavas</i>, who had become hidden by illusion (<i>māyā</i>) (III, <b>171</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> then fought with invisible weapons. Then they withdrew the illusion and entered their city. The fallen and their weapons covered the ground so that the horses had to proceed in the sky. The <i>Nivātakavacas</i> remaining invisible, covered the welkin with crags; others, entering into the earth, seized the legs of the horses and the wheels of the chariot. <i>Arjuna</i> became distressed, but being advised by <i>Mātali</i>, he applied the thunderbolt, inspiring the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> with <i>mantras</i>, so that the arrows sent by the thunderbolt, becoming thunderbolts, penetrated the illusions and killed the <i>Nivātakavacas</i>. While the wives of <i>Dānavas</i> were bewailing and at last fled to their palaces, <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Mātali</i> entered the city, that was superior to that of the gods (to that of <i>Indra</i>, v. 12188). <i>Mātali</i> told him that this was originally the city of <i>Indra</i>, but the gods had been driven away from it by the <i>Nivātakavacas</i>, who had through austerities gratified <i>Pitāmaha</i> and obtained from him the boons, that they might reside here and be free from danger from the gods. When <i>Indra</i> applied to <i>Svayambhū</i>, he was told that he himself in another body should destroy them. As the gods were unable to slay them, <i>Indra</i> had given those weapons to <i>Arjuna</i>, so that he might destroy them, Then <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Mātali</i> again went to the abode of the gods (III, <b>172</b>). —§ 445: While returning he beheld a celestial city, moving at will, with trees of gems, etc., with four gates, etc., and <i>Mātali</i> told him it was <i>Hiraṇyapura</i>, made by <i>Brahmán</i> himself for the great <i>Asuras</i>, the <i>Paulomas</i>, and <i>Kālakañjas</i>, as the <i>Daiteyī Pulomā</i> and the <i>Mahāsurī Kālakā</i> had by practising austerities for 1,000 celestial years obtained from <i>Svayambhū</i> that their offspring should suffer little misfortune, be incapable of being killed by gods, and obtain an aërial, etc., city, invincible even by the gods, <i>Maharṣis, Yakṣas</i>, <i>Gandharvas, Pannagas, Asuras</i>, and <i>Rākṣasas. Brahmán</i> had destined that <i>Arjuna</i>, a mortal, should kill them. “Therefore destroy them with the thunderbolt.” A battle ensued; the <i>Asuras</i> resorted to illusion; the city now entered into the earth, and now it rose upwards, etc. Shot with the iron shafts of <i>Arjuna</i> the city fell down. Then they environed him in 60,000 chariots, etc. <i>Arjuna</i> applied to <i>Rudra</i>, and seeing a man with three heads, nine eyes, etc., he applied the <i>Raudra</i> weapon to the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>; when it had been hurled, there appeared forms of deer, lions, tigers, <i>Garuḍas</i>, <i>Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Asuras, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas, Yātudhānas</i>, etc., by thousands. The <i>Dānavas</i>, some of whom had three heads, some four tusks, etc., were destroyed. <i>Arjuna</i> again worshipped <i>Tripuraghna</i> (i.e. Śiva). <i>Mātali</i> rejoiced and praised <i>Arjuna</i>. The wives of the <i>Dānavas</i> came out of the city bewailing the slain. <i>Mātali</i> took <i>Arjuna</i> to the abode of <i>Indra</i>, and related in detail to <i>Indra Arjuna's</i> achievement, and <i>Indra</i> with the <i>Maruts</i> (v. 12269: the gods) praised him, and said that gods, <i>Dānavas, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas, Asuras</i>, <i>Gandharvas</i>, birds, and serpents should not be able to resist him in fight, etc. (III, <b>173</b>).—§ 446: <i>Indra</i> said that on the battlefield <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa, Śakuni</i>, etc., should not amount to (1/16) part of <i>Arjuna</i>. Then <i>Indra</i> gave him “this” golden garland, the shell <i>Devadatta</i>, etc. (see § 443). Then <i>Indra</i> told him to depart, “and thus after five years I come to you on the summit of this lower range of <i>Gandhamādana (Gandhamādanapādasya</i>).” Having promised that he should in the next morning show <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> all the celestial weapons, <i>Arjuna</i> passed that night there with all his brothers (III, <b>174</b>).—§ 447: The next morning, when <i>Arjuna</i> was about to show the celestial weapons to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, the earth trembled, etc. The <i>Brahmarṣis, Siddhas, Maharṣis</i>, <i>Devarṣis</i>, gods, <i>Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas</i>, etc., <i>Pitāmaha</i>, the <i>Lokāpālas</i>, and <i>Mahādeva</i> with his <i>gaṇas</i> appeared; <i>Vāyu</i> threw celestial garlands, sent by the gods, on <i>Arjuna</i>, the <i>Gandharvas</i> chanted ballads, and <i>Apsarases</i> danced; and sent by the gods <i>Nārada</i> came and prevailed upon <i>Arjuna</i> not to use the celestial weapons without necessity, as they would destroy the three worlds. Then the gods, etc., went whence they had come, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> pleasantly dwelt in that same forest with <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> (III, <b>175</b>)."
