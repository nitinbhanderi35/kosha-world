A maharṣi who was a disciple of the Ṛṣi called Bhūti, who did once go to participate in a yajña conducted by his brother Suvarccas, leaving matters connected with his āśrama with Śānti, who discharged his duties quite well in the absence of his master. One day when agni became very scarce in the āśrama he praised Agnideva, and noticing that the Deva was pleased Śānti requested him to bestow a son on the maharṣi. Accordingly a son was born to Bhūti, who later on became famous as ‘Bhautyamanu.’ Bhūti, who was pleased with the devout life of his disciple (Śānti) taught him Sāṅgaveda. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa)."
