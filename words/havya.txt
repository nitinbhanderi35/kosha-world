A Rākṣasa about whom the following story is told in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>Havyaghna was born from the smoke which rose from the fire of a yajña which sage Bharadvāja along with his wife Paiṭhīnasī conducted on the banks of river Gautamī, and he began eating the havis. Questioned about it by Bharadvāja Havyaghna answered as follows:—“I am an unfortunate fellow called Kṛṣṇa cursed by Brahmā. If you would kindly sprinkle on me the Gaṅgā water, Suvarṇa, ghee and soma I will be redeemed from the curse. <dvsn n='NI'/>Bharadvāja complied with the request of Havyaghna and he got redemption from the curse."
