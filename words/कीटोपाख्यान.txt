Asked by <i>Vyāsa</i>, who was omniscient and knew the language of every animal, the worm said that it was running away from a large cart, lest it should be killed; every creature, in whatever situation it may be placed, becomes attached to it; “in even this order of being I am happy, I think, and wish to live”; in his former life he was a cruel <i>Śūdra</i>, a usurer, etc., never dedicating food to D. and P., etc. (description); he now was filled with repentance and grief; he had, however, worshipped his old mother, and once showed hospitality to a brahman; in consequence thereof the memory had not forsaken him, and he thought he should once more regain happiness (XIII, <b>117</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> said: “It is the consequence of a meritorious act of mine that thou art not stupefied; in consequence of my penances I am able to rescue a being of demerit by the simply granting him sight of my person; there is no stronger power than that of penances. Thou mayst again attain to righteousness and merit; the state of a worm is really fraught with great misery. The superior brahman worships the Sun and the Moon uttering <i>mantras</i>; when thou hast attained to that state, I shall impart to thee <i>Bráhman</i>.” The worm remained and was killed by the cart. He was reborn in diverse orders of being, such as a porcupine, Iguana, boar, deer, bird, <i>Cāṇḍāla, Śūdra</i>, and <i>Vaiśya</i>. Born at last as a <i>Kṣatriya</i> (with <i>Kāmboja</i> steeds, <i>Sūtas</i> and <i>Māgadhas</i>, etc.; description) through the grace of <i>Vyāsa</i>, he came and worshipped him. <i>Vyāsa</i> said that the sin of his former life had yet not been destroyed; he should become a brahman by giving up his life on the field of battle for the sake of cows or brahmans; performing many sacrifices he should attain to heaven, and after emancipation (<i>Brahma-bhūtaḥ</i>) he should enjoy eternal happiness. The ascending order of transmigration is: († v. 5774) animal <i>> Śūdra > Vaiśya > Kṣatriya ></i> <i>Brahman > Svarga</i> (XIII, <b>118</b>). He betook himself to severe austerities; <i>Vyāsa</i> went to him and said that the penances of the <i>Kṣatriyas</i> consist in the protection of all creatures; thereby he should attain to the state of a brahman. Then he protected his subjects righteously, and after death became a brahman. <i>Vyāsa</i> came and told him not to fear death, but only the loss of righteousness. He caused the earth to be marked with 100 sacrificial stakes, and then obtained a residence in the region of <i>Brahmán</i> himself, and obtained the eternal <i>Bráhman</i> by his own acts, according to the words of <i>Vyāsa</i>. Also the <i>Kṣatriyas</i>, who have been slain [on the field of Kurukṣetra], have attained to a meritorious end (<i>gatiṃ puṇyāṃ</i>); therefore, do not mourn on their account” (XIII, <b>119</b>)."
