Rājyalābha, Rājyalambha.) § 244: The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with <i>Kuntī</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> journeyed towards <i>Hāstina-</i> <i>pura. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> despatched <i>Vikarṇa, Citrasena, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Kṛpa</i> to receive them. The inhabitants were filled with joy. In order to prevent any difference between them and their cousins, <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> caused them, with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> in the van, to repair to <i>Khāṇḍavaprastha</i>, taking half the kingdom. With <i>Dvaipāyana's</i> assistance they measured out a piece of land for their city, which was very beautiful, and came to be called <i>Indraprastha</i>. Having settled the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> there, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came back with <i>Rāma</i> to <i>Dvāravatī</i> (I, <b>207</b>). —§ 245: When the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were dwelling in happiness at <i>Khāṇḍavaprastha</i>, one day the <i>Devarṣi Nārada</i> came to them, and recommended them to make an arrangement so that disunion might not arise among them for the sake of their common wife, mentioning how <i>Sunda</i> and <i>Upasunda</i> had killed each other for the sake of <i>Tilottamā. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked who those <i>Asuras</i> were, and who this <i>Tilottamā</i> was (I, <b>208</b>). —§ 246: <i>Sundopasundopākhyāna</i> (q.v.). The arrangement the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> made was, that if one of them should be sitting with <i>Draupadī</i>, and one of the other ones should happen to see it, he would have to retire into the forest for twelve years and live as a <i>brahmacārin</i>. Then <i>Nārada</i> went away (I, <b>212</b>)."
