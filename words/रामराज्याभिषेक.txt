A celestial voice was heard, <i>Vāyu</i>, etc. (γ) attested her innocence. <i>Brahmán</i> said that it was by his grace that <i>Rāvaṇa</i> (the enemy of D., G., N., Y., Dā., M.-ṛ.) had been unslayable; but <i>Sītā</i> had been protected by the curse of <i>Nalakūbara. Daśaratha</i> commanded him to take back his wife and rule his kingdom at <i>Ayodhyā</i>, his exile of fourteen years was over. <i>Rāma</i> gave boons to <i>Avindhya</i> and <i>Trijaṭā. Brahmán</i> and the gods, headed by <i>Indra</i>, granted <i>Rāma</i> adherence to virtue and invincibility, and the monkeys were restored to life. <i>Sītā</i> granted to <i>Hanūmat</i>, that his life might last as long as the fame of <i>Rāma</i>, and gave him celestial wines and drinks. <i>Mātali</i> said: “Thou hast dispelled the sorrows of D., G., Y., As., N., and men, and therefore all creatures with D., As., G., Y., Rā., and Pn. will always speak of thee.” Having made arrangements for the protection of <i>Laṅkā, Rāma</i>, etc. (δ) recrossed the bridge riding on <i>Puṣpaka</i>, at the seashore he dismissed the monkeys with presents, then he-re-entered <i>Kiṣkindhyā</i>, where he installed <i>Aṅgada</i> as <i>yuvarāja</i>. Having reached <i>Ayodhyā</i> he dispatched <i>Hanūmat</i> as envoy to <i>Bharata</i>. Then he entered <i>Nandigrāma</i> and saw <i>Bharata</i> and <i>Śatrughna</i>, <i>Bharata</i> made the kingdom over to him. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> and <i>Vāmadeva</i> installed him in the sovereignty under the <i>nakṣatra</i> which belongs to <i>Viṣṇu</i> (<i>Vaiṣṇave</i>, i.e. <i>Śravaṇa</i>, Nīl.). Then he dismissed <i>Sugrīva, Vibhīṣaṇa</i>, etc., and gave <i>Puṣpaka</i> back to <i>Kubera</i>. He then performed ten <i>jārūthya</i> horse-sacrifices on the <i>Gomatī</i> (III, <b>291</b>)."
