Knowing that his death was near, he told his subjects about it and went into the forests for tapas. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sorry over the departure of their king, his subjects as well as ministers began worshipping Sūrya, who appeared and blessed them saying that their king would live for ten thousand years in perfect health, victory and with all wealth and prosperity and other resources and with unimpaired youthfulness. <dvsn n='NI'/>The ministers and subjects greatly elated over the boon informed their king in the forest about it, but he only felt sorry about it. He told them that during his life for ten thousands years he would have to witness the death of his sons, grandsons and subjects and would thus have to be sad throughout life. <dvsn n='NI'/>The king consoled and made them return. Then he did rigorous tapas to Sūrya and secured from him the boon that during his life-time none would die. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa)."
