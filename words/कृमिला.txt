            "content": "4. <i>Kṛmilā</i>¦ (No. 40, L. 5): The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mentioned in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centuries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name in the fourth century.<sup>122</sup> But certain old seals found at Nālandā prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of Bihar.<sup>123</sup> The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far from Valgūdar.<sup>124</sup> The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also mentioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.<sup>125</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,<sup>126</sup> Vayu Purāṇa<sup>127</sup> and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>128</sup> Kṛmi, the son of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.<sup>129</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā. Malālasekera<sup>130</sup> recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā. Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā), and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant Kirmilā.<sup>131</sup> Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city stood.<sup>132</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>M.S. Pandey<sup>133</sup> opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mentioned in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.<sup>134</sup> According to this commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region which may be due to a change in the course of the river during so many centuries. The city was not very important and may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the Gaṅgā. According to Pandey<sup>135</sup> the name of the modern village Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that locality. <dvsn n='P'/>Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā with Valgūdar<sup>136</sup> and seems to prefer the claim of modern Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.<sup>137</sup> But in the district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of Dr. Pandey. <dvsn n='P'/>The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is sometimes also written as Krimi.<sup>138</sup>"
