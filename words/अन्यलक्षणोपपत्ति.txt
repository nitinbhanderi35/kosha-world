(-त्तिः) The taking place (of something) in consequence of the symptom i. e. the existence (of something else) being found somewhere else; in a Nyāya Sūtra, where the possibility of non-existence is argued from the circumstance that the existence of the counter-entity might be elsewhere: असत्यर्थे नाभाव इति चेन्नान्यलक्षणोपपत्तेः ‘if (you say that there is) no non-existence since the thing is not, it is not so, for (non-existence) might be, since (the counter-entity) might exist elsewhere’. E. अन्य (in the sense of a locative) -लक्षण (of an instrum.) and उपपत्ति."
