Sabhākriyā). § 261: <i>Maya</i> said he was a great artist (<i>mahākavi</i>), the <i>Viśvakarman</i> of the <i>Dānavas</i>, and asked <i>Arjuna</i> to tell him what he was to do for him, because he had been rescued by him. <i>Arjuna</i> told him to do something for <i>Kṛṣṇa (lokanāthaḥ Prajāpatiḥ</i>, v. 9), who asked him to build a palace for <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Maya</i> was introduced to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and recited the history of the Asura (<i>pūrvadeva-caritaṃ</i>), i.e. of Vṛṣaparvan (so Nīl.). Then on an auspicious day, after the initiatory rites, and having gratified thousands of <i>brahmans</i>, he measured out a piece of land 10,000 <i>kiṣkus</i> square (II, <b>1</b>). —§ 262: Kṛṣṇa departed for <i>Dvārakā</i> (v. <i>Bhagavad-</i> <i>yāna</i>).—§ 263: To the north of <i>Kailāsa</i>, near <i>Maināka</i>, there is a huge mountain named <i>Hiraṇyaśṛṅga</i>, consisting of jewels. Near this mountain is situated the lake <i>Bindusaras</i>, where King <i>Bhagīratha</i> had dwelt for many years, desiring to behold the <i>Gaṅgā</i>. There the lord of all beings (i.e. <i>Prajāpati</i>, Nīl) had performed 100 sacrifices, where, for the sake of embellishment, though not according to rule (<i>dṛṣtāntataḥ</i>), the sacrificial stakes were made of gems and the altars (<i>caityāḥ</i>) of gold. There the 1,000-eyed <i>Śacīpati</i> had become perfect (<i>siddhiṃ gataḥ</i>) by sacrifice. There <i>Bhūtapati</i> (= <i>Mahādera</i>, Nīl.) took up his abode after having created all the worlds, and there he dwells, worshipped by thousands of spirits (<i>bhūtaiḥ</i>). There <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, <i>Brahmán, Yama</i>, and <i>Sthāṇu</i> perform their sacrifices at the expiration of 1,000 <i>yugas</i>. There <i>Vāsudeva</i> has performed <i>sattras</i> for many years, and placed thousands and tens of thousands of sacrificial stakes adorned with golden garlands and altars of great splendour. There <i>Maya</i>, when the <i>Dānavas</i> wished to perform a sacrifice on the bank of the <i>Bindusaras</i>, had made utensils of gems from the house of <i>Vṛṣaparvan</i>. That wealth, which was guarded by <i>Yakṣas</i> and <i>Rākṣasas</i>, he brought away, and thereof constructed the palace of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. A club with which <i>Vṛṣaparvan</i> had slain all foes in battle, and which had been placed in <i>Bindusaras, Maya</i> gave to <i>Bhīmasena</i>; the conch-shell <i>Devadatta</i>, that came from <i>Varuṇa</i>, and was also there, he gave to <i>Arjuna</i>; at its sound all creatures trembled in awe. The palace surpassed the <i>Sudharmā</i> of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and the palace of <i>Brahmán</i>, and covered an area of 10,000 <i>kiṣkus</i> square. Eight thousand <i>Rākṣasas</i>, called <i>Kiṅkaras</i>, guarded and supported the palace. In it was a tank, whose lotuses were of dark-coloured gems, etc.; many kings mistook it for solid ground, and fell into it. The palace was constructed in seventeen months (II, <b>3</b>).—§ 264: Enumeration of <i>ṛṣis</i> (α) and kings (β) from various countries, who were present when <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, after having fed 10,000 brahmans. etc., entered the palace. Also <i>Tamburu</i>, the friend of <i>Dhanañjaya</i>, and the <i>Gandharva Citrasena</i> with his ministers, and many other <i>Gandharvas</i> and <i>Apsarases</i> and <i>Kinnaras</i> came there (II, <b>4</b>)."
