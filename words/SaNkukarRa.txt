One day a lean and bony ghost, hungry and panting came to the brahmin. To the brahmin's question the ghost replied thus; “In my previous life I was a rich brahmin. I looked after my family well, but did not worship Devas, guests or cows. Nor did I do any pious deed. But, one day I happened to worship Lord Viśvanātha and touch his idol. Within a short period after that I died. You will please tell me the means, if any, for me to attain heaven.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Śaṅkukarṇa answered the ghost as follows:—“There lives no man on earth, who is more fortunate than your good self, who could touch and prostrate before Lord Viśvanātha. That good fortune has led you to me. You bathe in this holy tīrtha and you will lose your ghosthood. The ghost, accordingly dived in the water and immediately rose up to heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Ādi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 34)."
