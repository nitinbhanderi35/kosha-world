A celestial voice said that the brahman is superior to the <i>kṣatriya; A</i>. maintained that the brahmans take refuge with the <i>kṣatriyas</i>; what the virgin <i>Gāyatrī</i> had said from the sky was not true (<i>asatyaṃ</i>, so B. and Nīl.). “I shall bring the skin-clad brahmans under my subjection.” At these words of <i>A</i>. the invisible goddess (<i>Gāyatrī</i>) became agitated (<i>vitrastā 'bhūn</i> <i>niśācarī</i>; cf. Nīl.). Then <i>Vāyu</i> (wind) warned <i>A.</i>, addressing him from the air. Asked by <i>A</i>. what kind of earthly creature the brahman is, if he resembles the wind, water, fire, sun, or sky (XIII, <b>153</b>), <i>Vāyu</i> praised the brahmans above all, citing <i>Kaśyapa (c), Aṅgiras (d), Gautama (e</i>), <i>[Kapila] (f), Aurva (g</i>), and <i>Dattātreya</i>; even <i>Agni (h</i>) and <i>Brahmán (i</i>) are brahmans; the large kingdom of the <i>Daṇḍakas</i> was destroyed by a brahman; the ocean, that was full of crystal water, cursed by the brahmans, became saline in taste. <i>Arjuna</i> remained silent (XIII, <b>154</b>). <i>Vāyu</i> repeated the story of <i>Kaśyapa</i> in detail, and asked <i>Arjuna</i> if he knew a <i>kṣatriya</i> superior to <i>Kaśyapa. Arjuna</i> remained silent. Then <i>Vāyu</i> related the story of <i>Utathya (j</i>) (XIII, <b>155</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> remained silent. <i>Vāyu</i> then described the greatness of <i>Agastya (k). Arjuna</i> remained silent. <i>Vāyu</i> related a feat of <i>Vasiṣṭha's (l</i>) (XIII, <b>156</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> remained silent. <i>Vāyu</i> related a feat of <i>Atri's (m). Arjuna</i> remained silent. <i>Vāyu</i> related a feat of <i>Cyavana's (n</i>) (XIII, <b>157</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> remained silent. <i>Vāyu</i> related the history of the <i>Kapas</i> (<i>p). Arjuna</i> praised the brahmans, mentioning <i>Dattātreya</i>. <i>Vāyu</i> told him always to protect them; “a terrible danger threatens thee from the <i>Bhṛgus</i>; that will take place after a time” (XIII, <b>158</b>)."
