            "content": "<b>Aṣṭa-karṇī</b>¦ is an expression which occurs in one passage of the Ṛigveda,<sup>1</sup> and which Roth<sup>2</sup> was at first inclined to interpret as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain. Roth<sup>3</sup> was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini<sup>4</sup> (<i>bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa</i>). Grassmann's more obvious rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’ is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on the ear’ (<i>karkari-karṇyaḥ</i>), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’ (<i>dātra-karṇyaḥ</i>), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ (<i>sthūṇā-</i> <i>karṇyaḥ</i>), ‘having the ears bored’ (<i>chidra-karṇyaḥ</i>), and <i>viṣtya-</i> <i>karṇyaḥ,</i> given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>5</sup> The simple meaning, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb <i>akṣ</i> occurs in the sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility. <dvsn n='P'/>The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is twice referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>6</sup> The mark is termed <i>lakṣman,</i><sup>7</sup> and was made with a copper-knife<sup>8</sup> (<i>lohita</i>). The Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>9</sup> forbids the use of an arrow-shaft (<i>tejana</i>), or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane (<i>ikṣu-kāṇḍa</i>) or copper. <F>1) x. 62, 7.</F> <F>2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, <i>s.v.</i></F> <F>3) <i>Cf.</i> Böhtlingk, Dictionary, <i>s.v.</i></F> <F>4) vi. 3, 115.</F> <F>5) iv. 2, 9.</F> <F>6) vi. 141, 1. 2; xii. 4, 6.</F> <F>7) Av. vi. 141, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, <i>loc. cit.</i></F> <F>8) Av., <i>loc. cit.</i></F> <F>9) <i>Loc. cit.</i> <dvsn n='P'/><i>Cf.</i> Zimmer, <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 234, 348; Delbrück, <i>Gurupūjākaumudī,</i> 48, 49; Weber, <i>Indische Studien,</i> 13, 466; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 387.</F>"
