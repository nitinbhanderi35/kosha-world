The elephant is also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mṛga Vāraṇa,<sup>4</sup> the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective <i>vāraṇa</i> similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later language. Pischel's view<sup>5</sup> that the catching of elephants by the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> elephants are described as ‘black, white-toothed, adorned with gold.’ <F>1) i. 64, 7; iv. 16, 14.</F> <F>2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, <i>s.v.; Nirukta, Erläuterungen,</i> 79.</F> <F>3) Pischel, <i>Vedische Studien,</i> 1, 99, 100, combats the view that the elephant was new to the Vedic Indian, because of the similar use of <i>mṛga mahiṣa</i> and <i>mṛga sūkara</i> (Av. xii. 1, 48) to denote the ‘buffalo’ and the ‘boar’ respectively. But <b>Mahiṣa</b> seems rather to bear out Roth's conclusion; while <b>Sūkara</b> appears alone in the Rigveda, and <i>mṛga sūkara,</i> ‘wild hog,’ seems to be used in one passage of the Av. (xii. 1, 48) to distinguish it from <b>Varāha,</b> ‘boar,’ in the same verse.</F> <F>4) Rv. viii. 33, 8; x. 40, 8.</F> <F>5) <i>Vedische Studien,</i> 2, 121-123; 317319. <i>Cf.</i> Strabo, pp. 704, 705; Arrian, <i>Indica,</i> 13. 14 (from Megasthenes).</F> <F>6) viii. 2, 6; x. 40, 8.</F> <F>7) viii. 23, 3 (<i>hiraṇyena parīvṛtān kṛṣṇāñ</i> <i>chukladato mṛgān</i>).
