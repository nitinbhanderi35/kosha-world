Uśanas</i>, by <i>yoga</i>, entered <i>Kubera</i>, and deprived him of his liberty and robbed him of all his wealth. <i>Kubera</i> repaired to <i>Śiva</i>, who prepared to slay <i>Uśanas</i> with his lance. <i>Uśanas</i> placed himself on the point of <i>Śiva's</i> lance. <i>Śiva</i> bent the lance with his hand (<i>pāṇinā samanāmayat</i>), whence it was called <i>Pināka</i>, and threw <i>Uśanas</i> into his mouth and swallowed him, and <i>Uśanas</i> began to wander there. <i>Mahādeva</i> entered the waters and remained there like an immovable stake of wood for millions of years. Then he rose from the mighty lake and <i>Brahmán</i> approached him. <i>Śiva</i> saw that <i>Uśanas</i> within his stomach (Nīl.) had become greater in consequence of those penances of his. He once more betook himself to <i>yoga-</i>meditation. <i>Uśanas</i>, filled with anxiety, began to wander within his stomach, and to sing his praises; but <i>Rudra</i> had stopped all his outlets; at last he let him go out through his urethra. Thence he came to be called <i>Śukra</i>, and became unable to attain the central point of the firmament. <i>Umā</i> prevented <i>Śiva</i> from slaying him, and <i>Uśanas</i> became her son (XII, <b>290</b>)."
