He was caught in the net (description) of some fishers (<i>kaivartāḥ</i>) along with a large number of fish, etc. They were afraid; <i>Cyavana</i> said that he would either die with the fishes or be sold with them. With pale faces the fishers repaired to king <i>Nahuṣa</i> (XIII, <b>50</b>), who immediately went to <i>Cyavana</i> with his ministers and priest; <i>Cyavana</i> asked him to pay the price for himself and the fishes; <i>Nahuṣa</i> ordered large sums to be paid to the <i>Niṣādas</i> for <i>Cyavana</i>; but the latter declared that these could not represent his price, even his whole kingdom; <i>Nahuṣa</i> deliberated with his ministers and priests; then there came an ascetic living in the woods, born of a cow, and said that the cow was equal in value to the <i>brahman</i>; this <i>Cyavana</i> approved of, as <i>svāhā-</i> and <i>vaṣaṭ-kāra</i> are always established upon kine, etc. <i>Cyavana</i> accepted the cow from the fishermen, and caused them along with the fishes to proceed to heaven. The two Ṛ. gladdened king <i>Nahuṣa</i> by granting him many boons; he accepted the boon that he should himself remain firm in virtue. The two Ṛ. returned each to his own asylum, and <i>Nahuṣa</i> to his city (XIII, <b>51</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> about <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>, etc. (α), <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited an old history of the discourse between <i>Cyavana</i> and <i>Kuśika</i>, i.e. <is>Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda</is> (<i>c</i>) (III, <b>52—56</b>)."
