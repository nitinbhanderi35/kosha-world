When everything was made ready to crown Śrī Rāma as the heir-apparent of Ayodhyā, it was Mantharā who persuaded Kaikeyī to go to Daśaratha and ask him to send Śrī Rāma to the forests. Had not the cruel tongue of Mantharā played like that, the history of the solar dynasty itself would have been different. (See under Kaikeyī)."
