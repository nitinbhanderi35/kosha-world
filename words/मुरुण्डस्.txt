They were one of the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer allegiance to Samudragupta. <dvsn n='P'/>According to Sten Konow <i>‘muruṇḍa’</i> is the later form of a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘ŚakaMuruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>372</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’<sup>373</sup> and Muruṇḍasvāminī<sup>374</sup> which shows that <i>Muruṇḍa</i> was the name of a tribe and not a title. <dvsn n='P'/>On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith<sup>375</sup> suggested that “the Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhotanagpur”. <dvsn n='P'/>According to R.K. Mookerji,<sup>376</sup> the people called here as the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten Konow.<sup>377</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We know that the term <i>Daivaputra</i> in the inscription has been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are mentioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji. <dvsn n='P'/>Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.<sup>378</sup> According to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is, therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.<sup>379</sup> Jayaswal took ŚakaMuruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada, Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western Satraps’.<sup>380</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi<sup>381</sup> and the Vaijayantī<sup>382</sup> the <i>Lampākas</i> are identified with Muruṇḍas. The <i>Lampākas</i> are the same as the <i>Lambatai</i> of Ptolemy.<sup>383</sup> The Purāṇas,<sup>384</sup> mention <i>Lampākas,</i> the people who were residing in <i>Lampāka,</i> the modern <i>Laghman</i> in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.<sup>385</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.<sup>386</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the first time under the name <i>Moroundai</i> and places them on the western border of the <i>‘Gangaridai’.</i> They seem to have occupied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita, Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river, and <i>Aganagora</i> with <i>Aghadip (Agradvīpa)</i> on the eastern bank of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.<sup>387</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>According to Cunningham, the name of the <i>Marundai</i> is still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.<sup>388</sup> But M.S. Pandey<sup>389</sup> opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. However, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized. Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far from their place of origin.<sup>390</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>M.S. Pandey<sup>391</sup> disagrees with the Puranic account on the basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mistakes of the copyists."
