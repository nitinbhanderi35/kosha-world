Certain Purāṇas hold the view that six faces were caused to Subrahmaṇya as he had to feed on six breasts at the same time while others opine that six mothers were deputed to feed him as he was born with six faces. Again, according to certain Purāṇas it was Pārvatī, who deputed the Kṛttikās. The child came to be known as Kārttikeya also as it was fed by the Kṛttikās. (Skanda Purāṇa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 37 and Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 6). <dvsn n='NI'/>After having fed Skanda the Kṛttikās entered into the sphere of the stars. (Vana Parva, Chapter 236, Verse 11). The star into which the Kṛttikās entered is called the Kṛttikā star. Nārada said once that if one feeds brahmins with ghee and pudding on Kārttika day one may ascend to Devaloka. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 64, Verse 5)."
