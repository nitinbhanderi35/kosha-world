From the branches of the tree milk, butter-milk, ghee, juice of Sugar-cane etc. descend carrying with them divine rice, clothes, ornaments etc. to the Kumuda mountain and flow in rivers towards the north. The people in those places get their rice, clothes ornaments etc. from the river. Mīnākṣīdevī praised by Devas has her abode here. Those who drink milk etc. flowing in the river will not be affected by hunger, thirst and signs of old age. Nor will any danger overtake them. They will live long. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha)."
