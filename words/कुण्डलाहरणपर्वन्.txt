Sūrya then came to Karṇa in a dream and dissuaded him from giving them. “There is beside some mystery which you will understand in time.” Karṇa refused to break his vow always to give to brahmans and confided in the weapons which he had obtained from Rāma Jāmadagnya and Droṇa. Sūrya then prevailed upon him to beseech Indra to give him a dart (III, <b>300—2</b>).—§ 547: Karṇa (q.v.)."
