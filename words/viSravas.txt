The son Vaiśravaṇa was born to him by his wife Ilabilā (Iḍabiḍā) and Rāvaṇa and his brothers by his wife Kaikasī. In Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 274, there is a story about the birth of Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera) as son to Viśravas. <dvsn n='NI'/>The son Vaiśravaṇa was born to Pulastya. Vaiśravaṇa rejected his father Pulastya and served his grandfather Brahmā. Pulastya did not like this. He generated another son Viśravas from half of his body. Viśravas tried to wreak vengeance on Vaiśravaṇa, who took refuge near Brahmā, who was much pleased at Vaiśravaṇa and granted him immortality, the state of being the owner of wealth, the position of ‘Lokapāla’, connection with Śiva, a son named Nalakūbara, the city of Laṅkā, the Puṣpaka Vimāna, the lordship of the Yakṣas and the title Rājarāja (King of Kings). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Family Life.</i> Kubera engaged three beautiful Rākṣasa damsels, Puṣpotkaṭā, Rākā and Mālinī to attend on Viśravas. Puṣpotkaṭā had the name Kaikasī also. Kaikasī gave birth to Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa. Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā were born to Rākā and Mālinī gave birth to Vibhīṣaṇa. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 275, Verse 7)."
