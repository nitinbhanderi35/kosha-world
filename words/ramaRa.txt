It was in this island that Vinatā, mother of Garuḍa and Kadrū, mother of the nāgas lived. Garuḍa, after freeing his mother from her slavery evicted the nāgas from this island. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 17). Following the eviction, many of the prominent nāgas lived in Pātāla. But, Kāliya, in fear of Garuḍa, lived in Kālindī. After his suppression by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Kāliya, with his family, as advised by Kṛṣṇa returned to Ramaṇakam. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha)."
