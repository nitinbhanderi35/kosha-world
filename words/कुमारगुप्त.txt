He has been mentioned as father of Pūrugupta and son of Candragupta II.<sup>83</sup> In No. 30, L. 4 Kumāragupta is described as shining (ruling) over the earth like the Sun in the winter. He is called <i>‘Paramabhaṭṭāraka’</i> and <i>‘Mahārājādhirāja’</i> in No. 31, L. 1. In No. 46, L. 4 he is mentioned only by his title <i>‘Mahendrāditya’,</i> and as the grandson of Samudragupta and son of Candragupta II. The Ārya-Mañju-Śrī-Mūlakalpa corroborates the title giving his name as Mahendra.<sup>84</sup> In No. 34, L. 2 he is mentioned as <i>‘Paramadaivata’, ‘Parmabhaṭṭā-</i> <i>raka’</i> and <i>‘Mahārājādhirāja’.</i> <dvsn n='P'/>Of the two parts of his name Kumāra is the name of god Skanda (or Kārttikeya)<sup>85</sup> and Gupta was his surname."

The first (No. 48) mentions A.D. 473 as the date of Kumāragupta who must, therefore, be taken as Kumāragupta II and the second (No. 54) mentions A.D. 476 as the date of Budhagupta. No. 48 records the date, Gupta year 154<sup>91</sup> when Kumāragupta was protecting the earth.<sup>92</sup> The renovation of the Sun temple mentioned in No 17, LL. 20-21 seems to have taken place in his reign.<sup>93</sup> It seems that Mookerji has by mistake, connected the reference<sup>94</sup> meant for Kumāragupta I with Kumāragupta II.<sup>95</sup> The temple was originally constructed in the reign of Kumāragupta I in M.S. 493 = A.D. 436 (L. 19)."
