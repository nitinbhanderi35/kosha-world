The Viṣṇu Purāṇa contains the following story about the origin of the Cakra. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sūryadeva (the Sun God) married Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśvakarmā. But, due to the insufferable heat of her husband the marital life of Saṃjñā became miserable, and so she requested her father to lessen the heat of Sūrya. And, accordingly Viśvakarmā ground Sūrya on a grinding machine and thus diminished his effulgence. But, the grinding could diminish only (1/8) of that effulgence, which glowing red-hot dropped on the earth, and with that Viśvakarmā made the Sudarśana Cakra, the Triśūla, the Puṣpakavimāna and the weapon called Śakti. Out of those four things the Triśūla came to be possessed by Śiva, the Puṣpakavimāna by Kubera and Śakti by Brahmā. The Sudarśana Cakra which was glowing like anything was deposited in the sea. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 3, Chapter 2). There is a story in the Mahābhārata as to how the Cakra thrown into the sea came into the possession of Mahāviṣṇu. While Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were picnicing on the shores of the Yamunā Agnideva went to them and requested them to give Khāṇḍava forest to him for food. As Takṣaka, friend of Indra, was living in the forest the latter was causing heavy rains to fall there. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna realized the fact that Agni would be able to consume the forest only after subjugating Indra. But, how to manage it? Then Agni said that he would supply the weapon to fight Indra with, and accordingly he meditated on Varuṇa, who presented to him (Agni) a chariot and flag with monkey as symbol, a quiver which would never become empty of arrows, a bow called Gāṇḍīva and the Sudarśana Cakra. Agnideva gave the Cakra to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the other things to Arjuna. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 297)."
