It is believed that Vararuci, Mahiseya and Atreya wrote Bhasyas on the Taittiriya Pratisakhya, but at present, only two important commentary works on it are available(a) the 'Tribhasyaratna', based upon the three Bhasyas mentioned above as the title shows, written by Somayarya and (b) the 'Vaidikabharana' written by Gopalayajvan.
