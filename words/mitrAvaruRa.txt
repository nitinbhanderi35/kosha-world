Agastya and Vasiṣṭha were born as sons of Mitrāvaruṇa. It was due to a curse by Mitrāvaruṇas that Urvaśī had to marry King Purūravas, a man of the earth. Manu had no children and he performed a yāga to placate Mitrāvaruṇas. But since there were many faults in the ceremony a girl was born to him. (For details see under Ilā, Nimi, Urvaśī, Vasiṣṭha and Mitra)."
