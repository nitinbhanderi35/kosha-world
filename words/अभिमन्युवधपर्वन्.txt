Abhimanyuvadha). § 593: <b>The 13th</b> <b>day</b>: Broken by <i>Arjuna</i>, and <i>Droṇa</i> having failed to seize <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, the <i>Kurus</i> were regarded as defeated; they heard all praising <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. Next morning <i>Duryodhana</i> blamed <i>Droṇa</i> for not having seized <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; <i>Droṇa</i> said that even D., As., G., Y., N., and Rā. cannot defeat the force protected by <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, save <i>Mahādeva</i>; but to-day he would slay a mighty car-warrior. The <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> challenged <i>Arjuna</i> and took him away to the southern side of the field. <i>Abhimanyu's</i> slaughter by <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> son is alluded to by <i>Sañjaya. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> grieves. <i>Sañjaya</i> relates (VII, <b>33</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> praises <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i>, etc. (α). <i>Droṇa</i> had formed the great circular array (<i>cakravyūha): Lakṣmaṇa</i> (the grandson of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>) at their head; <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (β) in the middle; at the head the commander <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (γ) (VII, <b>34</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were headed by <i>Bhīmasena: Sātyaki</i>, etc. (δ) & <i>Droṇa</i>, whom the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and the <i>Sṛñjayas</i> could not approach. <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> says that only <i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc. (ε), can break the array of <i>Droṇa</i>, and orders <i>Abhimanyu</i> to do it; <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (ζ) followed him; praised by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who says that the protectors of <i>Droṇa's</i> host resemble S., R., M., V., or <i>Agni</i>, or <i>Āditya, Abhimanyu</i> orders his charioteer <i>Sumitra</i> to urge the steeds towards <i>Droṇa's</i> army (VII, <b>35</b>). <i>Abhimanyu</i> (with <i>Sumitra</i>), etc., & <i>Droṇa</i>, etc.; <i>Abhimanyu</i> breaks that part of the <i>Kuru</i> army; many steeds of the <i>Vanāyu</i>, etc. (η), breeds were deprived of their ornaments, and caused delight to Rā., etc. (VII, <b>36</b>). <i>Duryodhana & Abhimanyu</i>; <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (θ) & <i>Abhimanyu</i> rescuing <i>Duryodhana; Duḥsaha</i>, etc. (ι), & <i>Abhimanyu</i>, who slew the heir of <i>Aśmaka</i>; <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (κ), & <i>Abhimanyu</i>, who slew <i>Suṣeṇa</i>, etc. (λ), and defeated <i>Śalya; Droṇa's</i> troops fled; P., D., Cā., Si., etc., glorify <i>Abhimanyu</i> (VII, <b>37</b>). <i>Abhimanyu</i> slays <i>Śalya's</i> younger brother, whose followers fled. <i>Abhimanyu</i>, with the weapons he has received from <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, defeats all the warriors that encounter him. <i>Droṇa's</i> army fled (VII, <b>38</b>). <i>Abhimanyu & Droṇa</i>, etc. (μ). <i>Droṇa</i> says that <i>Abhimanyu</i> delights <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ν). <i>Duryodhana</i> told <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (ξ), to crush <i>Abhimanyu</i>, whom they attacked; <i>Duḥśāsana & Abhimanyu</i> (VII, <b>39</b>); <i>Abhimanyu</i> addresses <i>Duḥśāsana</i> (mentioning the dice, etc.); <i>Duḥśāsana</i> is borne away by his charioteer; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ο), uttered leonine shouts, and attacked <i>Droṇa's</i> array. <i>Karṇa</i> (urged by <i>Duryodhana</i>). & <i>Abhimanyu</i> (desirous of proceeding towards <i>Droṇa</i>); when <i>Karṇa</i> is in great distress his younger brother encounters <i>Abhimanyu</i> (VII, <b>40</b>). <i>Abhimanyu</i> slays <i>Karṇa's</i> younger brother; <i>Karṇa</i> flies; the <i>Kaurava</i> array breaks, except the <i>Sindhu</i>-king (VII, <b>41</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (π), endeavour to follow <i>Abhimanyu. Jayadratha</i> checks them with celestial weapons. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> enquires of <i>Sañjaya</i> about the source of <i>Jayadratha's</i> energy; <i>Sañjaya</i> narrates the boon obtained by <i>Jayadratha</i> from <i>Śiva</i> (VII, <b>42</b>). <i>Jayadratha</i> vanquishes all the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> leaders with his steeds of the <i>Sindhu</i>-breed: <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ρ); <i>Bhīma</i> mounts the car of <i>Sātyaki</i>; the path made by <i>Abhimanyu</i> is closed up; notwithstanding the <i>Matsyas</i>, etc. (σ); they are all checked by <i>Jayadratha</i> (VII, <b>43</b>). <i>Abhimanyu</i> vanquished <i>Vṛṣasena</i>, who was borne away from the battle, and slew <i>Vasāliya</i> and many others (VII, <b>44</b>). <i>Abhimanyu</i> seized <i>Satyaśravas</i> and routed the <i>Kurus; Rukmaratha</i> (the son of <i>Śalya</i>) & <i>Abhi-</i> <i>manyu</i>, who slew him and his friends (100 princes) with the <i>Gāndharva</i>-weapon (<i>b</i>), though they were assisted by <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i>, who was filled with fear and fled (VII, <b>45</b>). <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (τ), & <i>Abhimanyu</i>, who beats them back-except <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> (who is followed by <i>Duryodhana</i>), who is slain. <i>Duryodhana</i> urged the troops to slay <i>Abhimanyu; Droṇa</i>, etc. (υ), encompassed <i>Abhimanyu</i>, who seeks <i>Jayadratha; Krātha's</i> son was slain, the others fled (VII, <b>46</b>). <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ϕ), & <i>Abhimanyu + Yudhiṣṭhira</i> supporting <i>Jayadratha; Karṇa</i> has one ear cut off; <i>Abhimanyu</i> slew <i>Vṛndāraka</i> and <i>Bṛhadbala</i> (VII, <b>47</b>); <i>Abhimanyu</i> once more pierced <i>Karṇa</i> in the ear, and slew the son of the <i>Magadha</i>-king, and <i>Aśvaketu</i>, and the <i>Bhoja</i> prince of <i>Mārttikāvata</i> (bearing the device of an elephant); the son of <i>Duḥśāsana & Abhimanyu; Aśvatthāman</i> & do.; <i>Abhimanyu & Śalya</i>, who mounts another car; <i>Abhimanyu</i> slew <i>Śatruñjaya</i>, etc. (χ); <i>Abhimanyu & Śakuni</i>, who tells <i>Duryodhana</i> to take counsel with <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc., about the means of slaying <i>Abhimanyu; Karṇa</i> asks <i>Droṇa</i> about the means of slaying <i>Abhimanyu; Droṇa</i>, saying that he is gratified by <i>Abhimanyu's</i> prowess, tells <i>Karṇa</i>, who is very afflicted with arrows, to cut off his bow, etc. <i>Karṇa</i> then cut off <i>Abhimanyu's</i> bow, <i>Kṛtavarman</i> slew his steeds, and <i>Kṛpa</i> slew his two <i>Pārṣṇi</i> charioteers; <i>Abhimanyu</i>, then attacked by six car-warriors, fights with the sword, which is cut off by <i>Droṇa</i>, while <i>Karṇa</i> cut off his shield (VII, <b>48</b>); then <i>Abhimanyu</i> fought with a wheel; then with a mace; <i>Abhimanyu & Aśvatthāman; Abhimanyu</i> slew (<i>? apothayat</i>) <i>Subala's</i> son <i>Kālikeya</i>, and slew 77 <i>Gāndhāra</i> followers of his, and 10 <i>Brahma-Vasātīyas</i> (<i>punar Brahma-Vasātīyān</i>, C.; B. has <i>punaś caiva Vasātīyān</i>), 7 <i>Kaikayas</i> (<i>Kaikayānāṃ</i>, C.; B. has <i>Kekayānām</i>), and 10 elephants; <i>Abhimanyu &</i> <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> son, who slays <i>Abhimanyu</i>. Invisible creatures censure the cowardly act of the <i>Kurus</i>, headed by <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>. The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> divisions fly, but are rallied by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (VII, <b>49</b>). In the evening the <i>Kurus</i> withdrew to their encampment. Rā. and Pś., etc., on the field of battle (VII, <b>50</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> laments on the fall of <i>Abhimanyu</i> (VII, <b>51</b>).—§ 594: <i>Vyāsa</i> comes and consoles him (“death takes all: D., Dā., G., without exception”), relating to him the ancient story of what <i>Nārada</i> had said in days of old to <i>Akampana</i> (q.v.). “This story is purifying, etc.; cast off thy grief; <i>Abhimanyu</i> has attained to heaven; sprung from <i>Soma</i>, he has disappeared in the lunar essence, cleansed from all his impurities” (VII, <b>54</b>).—§ 595: <i>Vyāsa</i> recites to <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> the story of <i>Sṛñjaya</i> (q.v.), to whom <i>Nārada</i> told <i>Ṣoḍaśarājika</i> (VII, <b>55—70</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> says that <i>Abhimanyu</i> has attained to that eternal goal which is attained by <i>Yogins</i>, and those that are living in heaven never prefer this world to heaven; “it is the living that stand in need of our grief, and not those who have attained to heaven; his sins increase for whom the living grieve.” Then <i>Vyāsa</i> disappeared, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> became free from grief; but—“what shall we say to <i>Arjuna?</i>” (VII, <b>71</b>)."
