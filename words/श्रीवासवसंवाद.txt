Once at dawn he performed his ablutions in the <i>Gaṅgā</i> (<i>Dhruvadvārabhavāṃ</i>), and so did <i>Indra</i>. They listened to the narratives told by the great D.—ṛ. They hymned the rising Sun, and then in the opposite direction beheld a luminous object riding on <i>Viṣṇu's</i> vehicle adorned with <i>Garuḍa</i> and <i>Sūrya</i>; it was <i>Śrī</i> with many Aps. (description); her names: <i>Padmā</i>, etc. (α). She said that they had formerly dwelt with the <i>Asuras</i> in consequence of her disposition to be bound by truth and merit; seeing, however, that the <i>Asuras</i> had assumed perverse natures, she had left them and wished to reside with <i>Indra</i>. Requested by <i>Indra</i>, she told that she had dwelt with the <i>Asuras</i> on account of their good behaviour, but after they had fallen off from virtue, she had deserted Dai. and Dā. and had come to <i>Indra</i>; “there where I reside, the seven other goddesses (β) and <i>Jayā</i> as the eighth, who love me, etc., desire to live; all of them and myself, having deserted As., have come to thee.” D.—ṛ., <i>Nārada</i>, and <i>Indra</i> gave her a hearty welcome. <i>Vāyu</i>, the friend of <i>Agni</i>, began to blow gently; all the deities assembled; heaven began to shower nectar upon the region of <i>Brahmán</i>, etc.; <i>Indra</i> began to pour rain; no one deviated from the path of righteousness, etc.; D., K., Y., Ra. became cheerful, etc. (XII, <b>229</b>)."
