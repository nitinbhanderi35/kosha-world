She was the mother of Dāmasvāminī who raised a pillar in her memory. <dvsn n='P'/>The name seems to have some relation with the word <i>Sabhā.</i><sup>15</sup> It can be an adjective from the word <i>Sabhā</i> combined with <i>§‘aṭ’</i> to move. Literally it may mean “one who moves in assemblies”."
