Mausala). § 793: <i>Vaiśam-</i> <i>pāyana</i> said: When the 36th year [after the great battle] was reached, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> beheld many unusual portents (specification). A little while afterwards he heard of the wholesale carnage of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> in a battle with clubs, where only <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Rāma</i> had escaped with life; he summoned his brothers and took counsel with them; they were filled with grief; the death of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> they could not believe. <i>Janamejaya</i> inquired about the particulars of the destruction of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas. Vaiśampāyana</i> said: **When the 36th year…(cf. above). Asked by <i>Janamejaya</i>, cursed by whom the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, etc. (α), met with destruction, <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: <i>Sāraṇa</i>, etc., saw <i>Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva</i>, and <i>Nārada</i> arrived at <i>Dvārakā</i>; they disguised <i>Śāmba</i> as a woman, calling her the wife of <i>Babhru</i>, and asked the ascetics what [sort of child] this one would bring forth. The ascetics answered: “This <i>Śāmba</i> will bring forth a terrible iron club for the destruction of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i>, except <i>Rāma</i> (who will enter the ocean) and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (whom <i>Jarā</i> will pierce while lying on the ground).” Then they went to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. Informed of what had taken place, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> summoned all the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and told them of it, but did not try to annul the curse. The next day <i>Śāmba</i> actually brought forth an iron club. The fact was reported to the king <i>[Ugrasena]</i>, who caused it to be reduced into powder and thrown into the sea. At the command of <i>Āhuka</i>, etc. (β), the manufacture of spirits was forbidden among all the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i>, under the penance of being impaled alive with all one's kinsmen. All the citizens (knowing that it was the command of Rāma also) bound themselves by the rule (XVI, <b>1</b>). [The embodied form of] Time every day wandered about their houses, like a man of terrible and fierce aspect, bald head, black and tawny of complexion; they shot innumerable arrows at him, without being able to pierce him. Also other dreadful portents of calamity were daily seen by the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> throughout the city (description). They showed disregard for brahmans, P., and D., etc., except <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. When the <i>Pāñca-</i> <i>janya</i> was blown in their houses, asses brayed aloud from every direction. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the 13th [and 14th] lunation, summoned the <i>Yādavas</i> and said: The 14th lunation has been made the 15th by <i>Rāhu</i> once more, as at the time of the great battle of the <i>Bharatas</i> (v. the note of PCR. on p. 5). He understood that the 36th year had come according to the curse of <i>Gāndhārī</i>, and that the omens were similar to those which <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had noticed when the two armies were arrayed in order of battle. He endeavoured to bring about those occurrences which would make <i>Gāndhārī's</i> words true. He commanded the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water, and caused the messengers to proclaim a journey to the sea-coast (XVI, <b>2</b>). At that time the <i>Vṛṣṇi</i> ladies dreamt every night that a black woman with white teeth, entering their abodes, laughed aloud and ran through <i>Dvārakā</i> stealing [from them]; the men dreamt of vultures that devoured the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i> in the houses and firechambers; their ornaments, etc., were taken away by Rā. The iron discus of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, given by <i>Agni</i>, with a nave of adamant, ascended to heaven. <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> chariot was dragged away by his four steeds over the ocean; <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> and <i>Baladeva's</i> standards (resp. <i>Garuḍa</i> and a palmyra), which were reverently worshipped by those two heroes, were taken away by Aps., who day and night called upon the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i> to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred water. They prepared various kinds of edibles and spirits, and set out to <i>Prabhāsa</i>. <i>Uddhava</i> took leave of them and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> before departing [from the world]. The <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, mixing with spirits the food that had been cooked for the brahmans, gave it to apes, and began revels with drinking, so also <i>Rāma</i>, etc. (γ); <i>Yuyu-</i> <i>dhāna</i> blamed <i>Kṛtavarman</i> for the nightly slaughter, and was applauded by <i>Pradyumna</i>, but was rebuked by <i>Kṛtavarman</i> with having killed <i>Bhūriśravas</i> while sitting in <i>prāya; Kṛṣṇa</i> cast an angry glance [at <i>Kṛtavarman</i>], and <i>Sātyaki</i> informed him of the story of the gem <i>Syamantaka</i>, which was <i>Satrājit's</i>; <i>Satyabhāmā</i>, weeping, approached <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and sitting on his lap enhanced his anger; <i>Sātyaki</i> swore that he would cause <i>Kṛtavarman</i> to follow the five sons of <i>Draupadī</i>, etc (δ), whom he had slain with the help of <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, and he severed his head in the very sight of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and began to strike down others; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> rushed forward to prevent him from doing further mischief, and the <i>Bhojas</i> and <i>Andhakas</i> all assailed him; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> did not interfere; they struck <i>Yuyudhāna</i> with the pots from which they had been eating; <i>Pradyumna</i> rushed forward to rescue <i>Yuyudhāna</i>; they were both slain. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> in wrath took up a handful of <i>erakā</i> grass, which became a terrible iron club, with which <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> slew all that came before him. The <i>Andhakas</i>, etc. (ε), also took up blades of the <i>erakā</i> grass, which were converted into iron clubs, and struck one another in consequence of the curse of the brahmans; son killed father and vice versa, inebriated with spirits. Beholding that <i>Śāmba</i>, etc. (ζ), were slain, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> exterminated the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and the <i>Andhakas. Babhru</i> and <i>Dāruka</i> told him now to go to <i>Rāma</i> (XVI, <b>3</b>). <i>Dāruka, Kṛṣṇa</i>, and <i>Babhru</i>, seeking <i>Rāma</i>, saw him sitting thoughtfully, reclining his back against a tree. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> sent <i>Dāruka</i> to inform <i>Arjuna</i> and tell him to come quickly, and he also dispatched <i>Babhru</i> to protect the ladies against robbers; but as soon as <i>Babhru</i> had proceeded to a distance, an iron club attached to the mallet of a hunter came and slew him. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> then, entering <i>Dvāravatī</i>, told his father to protect the ladies till <i>Arjuna</i> came, saying that he would practise penances with <i>Rāma</i>. When he came to <i>Rāma</i>, the latter had applied himself to <i>yoga</i>, and from his mouth issued a huge white <i>Nāga</i> with 1,000 heads and red eyes, who proceeded to the ocean, and was received by the ocean and many celestial snakes (and many sacred rivers): <i>Karkoṭaka</i>, etc. (η). After <i>Rāma's</i> death <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> wandered for some time, and then sat down, thinking of <i>Gāndhārī</i> (§ 619) and <i>Durvāsas</i> (§ 773<i>c</i>), and the destruction of the <i>Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas</i>, and <i>Kurus</i>, whence he concluded that the hour [of his death] had come; he then restrained his senses [in <i>yoga</i>]; though he was the Supreme Deity, he wished to die in order to dispel all doubts, etc., and to make the words of <i>Durvāsas</i> true. The hunter <i>Jarā</i>, mistaking <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> for a deer, pierced him at the heel with an arrow; coming up, he beheld a man dressed in yellow robes, rapt in <i>yoga</i>, with many arms; he became filled with fear; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> comforted him and then ascended upwards, and was received in heaven by <i>Indra</i>, etc. (θ) (XVI, <b>4</b>). Meanwhile <i>Dāruka</i> came and informed the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> of the slaughter of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Arjuna</i> with <i>Dāruka</i> proceeded to <i>Dvārakā</i>; when <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> 16,000 wives saw <i>Arjuna</i>, they uttered a loud cry; the city seemed to <i>Arjuna</i> to be the fierce river <i>Vaitaraṇī; Arjuna, Satyā</i> (the daughter of <i>Satrājit</i>), and <i>Rukmiṇī</i> fell down and wailed; then praising <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and comforting the ladies, <i>Arjuna</i> went to <i>Vasudeva</i> (XVI, <b>5</b>), whom he found lying on the ground and burning with grief; <i>Vasudeva</i> lamented (κ) and said he would die by abstaining from food (XVI, <b>6</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> said that the hour had come for the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> also for departing [from the world] (λ); he would, however, first remove to <i>Indraprastha</i> the women, the children, and the aged of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>. Saying to <i>Dāruka</i> that he wished to see the chief officers of the <i>Vṛṣṇis, Arjuna</i> entered the hall of the <i>Yādavas</i> called <i>Sudharmā</i>, where he said to the citizens and ministers that he would take away with him the remnants of the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i>, as the sea would soon engulf the city; <i>Vajra</i> would be their king at <i>Indraprastha</i>; they would set out on the seventh day at sunrise. <i>Arjuna</i> passed that night in the mansion of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. At dawn <i>Vasudeva</i> by <i>yoga</i> attained to the highest goal; the ladies were in despair. His four wives, <i>Devakī, Bhadrā, Rohiṇī</i>, and <i>Madirā</i>, ascended the funeral pyre, and attained to the regions of <i>Vasudeva</i>. When <i>Arjuna</i> had caused <i>Vasudeva</i> and his four wives to be burnt (under immense tokens of sympathy from the women), the boys (headed by <i>Vajra</i>) and the ladies offered oblations of water to <i>Vasudeva</i>. Then <i>Arjuna</i> visited the spot where the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> had been killed and caused the last rites to be performed, and caused <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to be cremated. On the seventh day he set out, mounting his chariot, with the ladies and children, the <i>Yādava</i> troops, and other inhabitants, with <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> 16,000 wives and <i>Vajra</i>; they numbered many millions in all. Then the ocean flooded <i>Dvārakā</i>. They proceeded in slow marches. When they had planted their encampment at <i>Pañcanada</i>, the <i>Ābhīras (Mlecchas</i>) conspired to rob the cavalcade. <i>Arjuna</i> succeeded only with great difficulty in stringing his bow; his celestial weapons would not come to his mind; the <i>Vṛṣṇi</i> warriors failed to rescue the women, who were snatched away by the robbers; <i>Arjuna's</i> shafts soon became exhausted; formerly they had been inexhaustible. <i>Arjuna</i> became very cheerless; he escorted the remnant of the cavalcade to <i>Kurukṣetra</i>; he established the son of <i>Kṛtavarman</i> in the city of <i>Mārttikāvata</i> with the remnant of the women of the <i>Bhoja</i> king; the remainder, with children and old men and women, at <i>Indraprastha</i>, with <i>Vajra</i> as their ruler; the son of <i>Yuyudhāna</i> (with old men, etc.) on the banks of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>; the widows of <i>Akrūra</i>, notwithstanding the entreaties of <i>Vajra</i>, entered the woods; <i>Rukmiṇī</i>, etc. (μ), ascended the funeral pyre; <i>Satyabhāmā</i> and the other wives of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> entered the woods in order to practise penances in the contemplation of <i>Hari</i>; going beyond <i>Himavat</i>, they took up their abode in <i>Kalāpa-grāma</i>. Then <i>Arjuna</i> entered the retreat of <i>Vyāsa</i> (XVI, <b>7</b>). Asked by <i>Vyāsa</i> (“Hast thou been sprinkled with water from anybody's nails or hair, etc.?”), <i>Arjuna</i> informed him of what had passed (ν) (“500,000 warriors have thus been laid down”). <i>Vyāsa</i> said that the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i> had been consumed by the brahman's curse; it was destiny: “<i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, as also the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, have finished their work; the time has come for your departure from the world,” etc. (ξ). <i>Arjuna</i> entered <i>Hāstinapura</i> and informed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> of what had taken place (XVI, <b>8</b>)."
