According to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana<sup>4</sup> he was a king, sister's son of <b>Uccaiḥśravas,</b> according to the latter authority. His people were the <b>Pañcālas,</b> of whom the Keśins must therefore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold (<i>tryanīka</i>).<sup>5</sup> A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with <b>Ṣaṇḍika</b> in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> this appears in another form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> He was a contemporary of a fellow sage, <b>Keśin Sātyakāmi,</b> according to the Maitrāyaṇī<sup>7</sup> and Taittirīya<sup>8</sup> Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> tells how he was taught by a golden bird. <dvsn n='P'/>In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is hardly necessary. <F>1) This is the form of the name in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa; also later in the Bṛhaddevatā.</F> <F>2) This is the form in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
