One of the nine great poets in Sanskrit reputed as the nine gems in Vikramāditya's court. <dvsn n='NI'/>“Dhanvantari—Kṣapaṇak Āmarasiṃha—Śaṅku—Vetālabhaṭṭa—Ghaṭakarpara—Kālidāsāḥ”. A poem of twenty-two verses in Sanskrit called Ghaṭakarpara kāvya is attributed to him. The theme of the poem is a message despatched by the hero to his wife who has only recently been married. All the stanzas are in yamaka (repeating a word or set of words to convey different meanings at the end of each line). By composing a poem called ‘Nalodaya’, Kālidāsa answered the challenge posed by Ghaṭakarpara in the use of Yamaka. Ghaṭakarpara answered Kālidāsa in the following stanza. <Poem>Eko hi doṣo guṇasannipāte nimajjatīndoriti yo babhāṣe / nūnam na dṛṣṭaṃ kavināpi tena dāridryadoṣo guṇarāśināśī.</Poem> (Kālidāsa, in verse 3, Canto 1 of Kumārasaṃbhava had written ‘Eko hi doṣo guṇasannipāte nimajjatīndoḥ kiraṇeṣvivāṅkaḥ”. In the above verse by Ghaṭakarpara the usage ‘Kavināpi tena’ may be interpreted in two ways, viz. Kavinā+api+tena and Kavi+nāpitena. By the second combination Ghaṭakarpara converted Kālidāsa into a barber (nāpita)."
