Buddhism which had its origin in North India, prevailed everywhere in India up to the eleventh century A.D. During that period there was an overflow of this religion to the other parts of Asia. Now this religion has its full sway over the people of Burma. 90% of the population there, are adherents of Buddhism. 80% of the people of Thailand, 60% of the people in Ceylon and Japan and 17% in China are now Buddhists. In India, Pakistan and the Philippines the Buddhists are only a minority. Even though Indonesia is a Muslim country there is a small class of Buddhists there. Combodia, Lavos and Tibet are considered to be Buddhist countries. In Nepal there are only two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. In countries outside Asia there are followers of Buddhism. Statistics reveal that there are one hundred and sixtyfive thousand Buddhists in North America, one hundred and thirtyfive thousand in South America, and ten thousand in Europe. The number of Buddhists in the world today is 150.31 crores."
