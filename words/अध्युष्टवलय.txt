This word occurs in the poem Ānandalaharī as the epithet of a serpent, to indicate that it is in profound sleep, forming, then, three ringlets and a half; the god Śiva is likened to a serpent coiled up in this manner, its half ringlet being compared to his Śakti or female energy and the three others to the god as representing the Trimūrti.
