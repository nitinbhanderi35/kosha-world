            "content": "PRABHĀVATĪ V¦. Daughter of the demon Vajranābha. She was married to Pradyumna, son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>There was once a very valiant demon called Vajranābha. He went into the valley of Meru and performed penance to propitiate Brahmā. Brahmā appeared before him and he got from him boons such as strength to conquer and subdue all kings, the secret of leaving the body and entering that of others etc. Empowered with these boons he made Vajranābhapura his capital. He got a daughter named Prabhāvatī. His brother Sunābha had two daughters named Candramatī and Guṇavatī. <dvsn n='NI'/>While he was thus living there, he set out on a campaign of victory. He conquered the whole world and then turned his eyes towards Svarga. Going to Indraloka he told thus: “Hi, son of Kaśyapa, I am also born of Kaśyapa. Your mother Aditi and my mother Diti are both wives of Kaśyapaprajāpati. You ruled over Svarga till this time. Now, let me rule over it for some time.” Indra was embarrassed by this logical challenge and could not give any reply to him. Kaśyapaprajāpati was then performing a long Yāga and Indra replied he would find a solution to his demand when their father returned after the Yāga. From that moment onwards Indra started thinking of plans to destroy Vajranābha. He went and sought help from Śrī Kṛṣṇa residing in Dvārakā. Krsna promised to help him when the time came. After returning to Devaloka, Indra started planning to kill Vajranābha. Vajranābhapurī was surrounded by skyscraping fortresses and admission inside was restricted. He, therefore, called the gaily loitering swans of Devaloka to his side and told them thus: “Look here, swan— ladies. You should go to Vajranābhapurī and see Prabhāvatī and then describe to her the beauty and goodness of Pradyumna. Your description should be such that Prabhāvatī should fall in love with Pradyumna. After that you should go to Pradyumna and tell him about Prabhāvatī in a similar way. On completing your mission you should come and report to me.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Obeying the orders of Indra the swans flew to Vajranābhapurī. They saw Prabhāvatī in a secluded spot and told her just what they were asked to tell her. Then they flew to the side of Pradyumna and told him about Prabhāvatī. After successfully completing their mission they flew to Devaloka. The marriage day of Prabhāvatī drew near. The swans went to Prabhāvatī again and made her request her father to include the performances of a dramatic troupe also in the programme of marriage festivities. Vajranābha agreed and a troupe was invited. The dramatic troupe comprised among others many Yādava soldiers, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Pradyumna and his brothers, all in disguise. Their drama was Rāmāyaṇa. The performance was superb and even Vajranābha stood amazed at their skill. The troupe was encamped in another palace and treated as royal guests. The companion maid of Prabhāvatī, Sūcīmukhī, united her with Pradyumna during the dark hours of the night and they spent the nights in amorous sports. The daughters of Vajranābha's brother, Candravatī and Guṇavatī came to know of these secret meetings and they requested Prabhāvatī to find out suitable persons among the Yādavas for them also to enjoy with. Prabhāvatī introduced them to Gada and Sāmba both sons of Kṛṣṇa. The amorous sports of all of them continued freely during the nights. <dvsn n='NI'/>When things progressed so far, Indra and Kṛṣṇa persuaded Pradyumna to kill Vajranābha. Pradyumna started a war with Vajranābha and in the great battle that ensued Pradyumna killed Vajranābha. Pradyumna and his brothers then took the demon girls to Dvārakā. Pradyumna, Gada and Sāmba married Prabhāvatī, Candravatī and Guṇavatī respectively. By this time Kaśyapaprajāpati returned to Devaloka after his long yāga. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Chapters 91 to 95)."
