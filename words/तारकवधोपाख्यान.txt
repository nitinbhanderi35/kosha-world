Amongst the celestial ladies there were none, save these, that could bear the seed of <i>Agni</i> in their wombs. <i>Agni</i> became gratified. His energy was divided into six portions, and a portion was placed in each of the <i>Kṛttikās</i>. All of them were delivered at the same time, and the six portions united into one. The Earth received the child from a heap of gold. He grew up in a celestial forest of reeds, reared by the <i>Kṛttikās</i> (whence he came to be called <i>Kārttikeya</i>; etymology of <i>Skanda</i> and <i>Guha</i>). The thirtythree gods, etc. (α) came to see him; Ṛ. praised him, G. sang in honour of <i>Kumāra</i>, with six faces, etc. (description). The gods gave him various kinds of toys, etc. (β). Rā. and As. began to walk in the train of <i>Skanda. Tāraka</i> in vain sought, by various means, to slay him. The gods made him the commander of their forces, and when he had grown up he slew <i>Tāraka</i> with his irresistible dart as in sport, and re-established <i>Indra</i> in the sovereignty. <i>Skanda</i> became the protector of the gods and [always] did what was agreeable to <i>Śaṅkara</i> (i.e. Śiva). Gold is the powerful energy of <i>Agni</i> and was born [from the same seed] with <i>Kārttikeya</i>; hence gold is highly auspicious. Thus did <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> relate to <i>Rāma</i> <i>[Jāmadagnya]</i> in days of old. By making gifts of gold <i>Rāma</i> became purified of all his sins, and [finally] attained to a high place in heaven that is not easily attainable by men (XIII, <b>86</b>)."
