Nāradāgamana).—§ 792: <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: Two years after their return from the retreat of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were visited by D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired after <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. <i>Nārada</i> said: After thy return from <i>Kurukṣetra, Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> proceeded towards <i>Gaṅgādvāra</i> with the sacrificial fire and <i>Gāndhārī</i>, <i>Kuntī, Sañjaya</i>, and all the <i>yājakas</i>. They themselves took to severe austerities (description), while the sacred fire was duly worshipped by the <i>yājakas</i>. They wandered about, <i>Sañjaya</i> acting as a guide, <i>Pṛthā</i> becoming the eye of <i>Gāndhārī</i>. Once Dhṛtarāṣṭra bathed in the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, and was returning to his retreat. A violent forest conflagration set in; <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> dismissed <i>Sañjaya</i> and sat down, facing the east, with <i>Gāndhārī</i> and <i>Kuntī</i>; they concentrated their soul, and were burnt by the conflagration. <i>Sañjaya</i> escaped and was seen by me (<i>Nārada</i>) on the banks of the <i>Gaṅgā</i> in the midst of ascetics; he bade them farewell and started for <i>Himavat</i>. In the course of my wanderings I saw the three bodies. The ascetics, from whom I heard all the details, did not at all grieve for them. <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the citizens felt great grief (XV, <b>37</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> lamented (α) (XV, <b>38</b>). <i>Nārada</i> comforted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> by informing him of the sacred character of the fire that had burnt <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and the two queens. When <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> entered the woods he caused his sacrificial fires to be duly ignited; having performed his sacred rites with them he abandoned them all; then the <i>Yājakas</i> had left them in a solitary part of the wood and gone away; the fires thus left to themselves produced a general conflagration; “this is what I have heard from the ascetics on the <i>Gaṅgā</i>.” <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: Headed by <i>Yuyutsu</i> the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the citizens all proceeded to the <i>Gaṅgā</i> in order to offer oblations of water to the deceased king and queens. Then they came back, taking up their residence outside the city. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sent, a number of men to the retreat to cremate the remains of his uncle, aunt, and mother in due form. On the twelfth day he performed the <i>śrāddhas</i> with gifts in abundance (description). Then all returned to <i>Hāstinapura</i>. The great Ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>, having comforted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, went away. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> had passed three years in the forest and fifteen years in the city. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was plunged in grief [*; not in B.] (XV, <b>39</b>)."
