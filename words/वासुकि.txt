Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet they had to find a way out before it was too late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of Janamejaya did not get started or, if started, it could be defeated in its purpose (<i>yathā sa</i> <i>yajño na bhaved yathā vāpi parābhavet</i> 1. 33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the suggestions made by serpents to avoid the snake sacrifice but did not agree with any one of them; he himself had nothing better to offer, hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha Brahman had prophesied that the son of the great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having the same name would stop the snake sacrifice and free virtuous serpents from danger, Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister, who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when he came begging for a maiden; that would put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34. 1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean, the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very much disturbed due to the curse of his mother and that Pitāmaha should free him from his mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki had always acted for the benefit of the gods and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha had then told the gods that when the occasion arrived Vāsuki should act according to the advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25; 1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appointed various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jaratkāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl of his name and who was offered as alms; knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also told him that even after marriage it would be Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42. 16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his sister had the same name as the sage and that he would support her even after marriage with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2; 1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru went with his wife to the shining house (<i>vāsagṛhaṃ śubhram</i> 1. 43. 5) approved by Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki about his departure and that he had lived happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife pleaded with the sage that he should not abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki would feel if he knew that her husband had left her without blessing her with a son— that being the principal purpose of their marriage—1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry; but he would not pursue the sage fearing that he might curse him; he knew it was improper to ask his sister if she was with a child from Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter prompted him to do that (<i>kiṃ hi kārya-</i> <i>garīyastvāt tatas tvāham acūcudam</i> 1. 44. 6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous son will be born to her; she removed his anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1. 44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death of a large number of serpents and feared that he himself might fall into the fire; he therefore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 1926; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to fulfil the purpose for which she was married to Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1. 49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was terribly upset, that he would release him from the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21; when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by saying that he felt he was revolving, that his heart was bursting, and that he had lost sense of directions as he was afflicted by the punishment inflicted by Brahman (<i>āstīka</i> <i>parighūrṇāmi hṛdayaṃ me vidīryate / diśaś</i> <i>ca na prajānāmi brahmadaṇḍanipīḍitaḥ</i> 1. 49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would destroy Vāsuki's fear of <i>brahmadaṇḍa</i> 1. 49. 22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult task Āstīka returned to his mother and maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to them all that had happened at Janamejaya's snake sacrifice; all the serpents present were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18. <b>H.</b> Functions and Events: (1) He is one of the <i>nāgas</i> who wait upon Varuṇa in his <i>sabhā</i> without feeling fatigue 2. 9. 8, 11; (2) present among those who arrived to greet the birth of Arjuna 1. 114. 60; (3) he sided with Arjuna when those who had gathered in the mid-region to watch the battle took sides between Arjuna and Karṇa 8. 63. 36; (4) he was one of the snakes who received the white serpent issuing from Balarāma's mouth and entering the ocean 16. 5. 14, 12; (5) after Skanda's consecration as the leader of the army (9. 43. 48) and when gifts were given to Skanda, Vāsuki gave him two snakes, Jaya and Mahājaya 9. 44. 48; (6) when Uttaṅka blew into the anus of the horse (god Fire), the house of Vāsuki and other prominent snakes in the <i>nāgaloka</i> were covered with smoke 14. 57. 46-47."
