Because she showers prosperity on her devotees she became known as Maṅgalacaṇḍikā. There is another version that she got the name because she was worshipped by Maṅgala (Kuja) and because she grants the requests of Maṅgala. Yet another version is that she got the name because she was worshipped by the King Maṅgala chief of the seven islands. Born of the species of Durgādevī she is very kind and affectionate to her devotees. Paramaśiva worshipped this Devī before he went to destroy the demon-trio Tripuras. (9th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata)."
