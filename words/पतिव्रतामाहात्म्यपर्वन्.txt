Pativratāyā māhātmyaṃ Sāvitryāḥ). § 545: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya</i> related, on account of <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>: The <i>Madra</i> king <i>Aśvapati</i>, the husband of <i>Mālavī</i>, was old and childless. After eighteen years of vows and offerings to <i>Sāvitrī, Sāvitrī</i> granted him a boon; he asked for many sons, but was promised a daughter. She was called <i>Sāvitrī</i>. As nobody asked her in marriage, she was sent to look for a husband herself (III, <b>293</b>). She chose <i>Satyavat</i>, the son of the <i>Śālva</i> king <i>Dyumatsena</i> (the husband of <i>Śaibyā</i>), who had been blinded and deprived of his kingdom and lived as an ascetic in the forest. <i>Satyavat</i> equalled <i>Rantideva Sāṅkrti, Śibi Auśīnara, Yayāti</i>, etc., but <i>Nārada</i> said: “Within a year of this day he will die”; then <i>Nārada</i> went to heaven (III, <b>294</b>). After her marriage <i>Sāvitrī</i> dressed in bark garments, etc. (III, <b>295</b>). She counted the days, and having ascertained that her husband would die on the fourth day following, she observed a <i>trirātra</i> vow; on the fourth day all the ascetics uttered benedictions that she should never suffer widowhood; she would not eat before the sun set. She followed <i>Satyavat</i> as he, taking his axe, set out for the woods (III, <b>296</b>). He fell ill and slept with his head on her lap. <i>Yama</i> himself—and not his emissary—came with a noose in his hand and pulled out of the body of <i>Satyavat</i> a person of the size of a thumb, bound it in the noose and proceeded in a southern direction. <i>Sāvitrī</i> followed him and was granted five boons: (1) that her father-in-law should attain his eyesight and be strong; (2) that her father-in-law should regain his kingdom and never fall off from his duties; (3) that her father should have 100 sons; (4) that she and <i>Satyavat</i> should have 100 sons “begotten from both of us”; (5) that <i>Satyavat</i> should be restored to life and live 400 years. <i>Yama</i> untied the noose; she went back to the corpse and placed his head on her lap. <i>Satyavat</i> regained his consciousness. He was anxious about his parents, and they returned to the hermitage (III, <b>297</b>). Meanwhile <i>Dyumatsena</i> had regained his sight, but was anxious at not finding <i>Satyavat</i>. He was comforted by the brahmans <i>Suvarcas, Gautama, Bharadvāja, Dālbhya</i>, <i>Apastamba</i>, and <i>Dhaumya</i>. A little while afterwards <i>Satyavat</i> and <i>Sāvitrī</i> reached the hermitage. <i>Sāvitrī</i> narrated everything that had happened and was praised by the ṛṣis (III, <b>298</b>). Meanwhile the enemy of <i>Dyumatsena</i> had been slain by his minister, and <i>Dyumatsena</i> then again became king of the <i>Śālvas. Sāvitrī</i> after a long time gave birth to 100 sons, and her father also got 100 sons by <i>Mālavī</i>. “So also <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> will rescue ye all.” <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and his brothers continued to live in the <i>Kāmyaka</i> forest (III, <b>299</b>)."
