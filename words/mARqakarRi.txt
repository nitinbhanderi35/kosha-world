Devas were bewildered and they sent five beautiful celestial maidens to divert the attention of the sage from his severe austerities. They enticed him and the sage constructed a grand and palatial house for them and stayed there with them. There was always music and dance there. The pond was thereafter known as ‘Pañcāpsaras’. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa during their exile in the forests with Sītā visited this place. (Sarga 11, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa)."
