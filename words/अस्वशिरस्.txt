Ed. 3. 79. 21: <i>aśvaśiro 'svavidyām yayā bṛhadaśva iti</i> <i>muner nāma / upaspraṣṭuṃ snānādikaṃ</i> <i>kartum</i>) (this Aśvaśiras apparently was in the vicinity of the Kāmyaka forest where Bṛhadaśva met the Pāṇḍavas 3. 49. 2, 29); (2) Arjuna, on his way to the mountain Himavant to receive the Pāśupata <i>astra</i> from Śiva crossed many places near the Himavant, one of them being Aśvaśiras 7. 57. 28 (this Aśvaśiras seems to be different from the one referred to in the above event)."
