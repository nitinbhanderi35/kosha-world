THE LAST PART OF THE 15TH DAY. After the fall of <i>Droṇa</i>, the <i>Kurus</i>, even <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (α), fled away, <i>Kṛtavarman</i> with the remnant of his <i>Bhoja</i> troops, etc. (β), <i>Suśarman</i> with the remnant of the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>. Only <i>Aśvatthāman</i> did not flee: <i>Aśvatthāman</i> & <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc. (γ). <i>Aśvatthāman</i> asked <i>Duryodhana</i> why the troops were fleeing away, even <i>Karṇa's</i> troops; <i>Duryodhana</i> caused <i>Kṛpa</i> to inform <i>Aśvatthāman</i> of the truth (δ), at which <i>Aśvatthāman</i> was filled with rage (VII, <b>193</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> what <i>Aśvatthāman</i> said (ε), he who knew the weapons of men and <i>Vāruṇa</i>, etc. (ζ) (VII, <b>194</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> related: <i>Aśvatthāman</i> complained before <i>Duryodhana</i> that his father has been killed (η), and vowed to destroy the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; neither D., nor G., As., U., Rā., etc., were able to vanquish him; there were none equal to him and <i>Arjuna</i> in knowledge of weapons; he had a weapon (the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> weapon) that neither <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (θ) knew, given by <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> to his father as a boon, with the promise that no man should ever be his equal in battle; only, this weapon must never be used in haste, etc., and never be hurled upon persons that abandon their chariots or weapons in battle, etc.; with this he would rout and slay the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ι). The <i>Kuru</i> army rallied; many blew their conches, etc.; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> took counsel of one another; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> touched water and invoked the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> weapon (VII, <b>195</b>). Fierce omens in nature appeared. D., Dā., and G. became inspired with fear. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> what counsel was adopted by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in order to protect <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> on seeing the retreating <i>Kauravas</i> once more advance to battle, rallied by <i>Aśvatthāman. Sañjaya</i> related: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> spoke about the matter to <i>Arjuna</i> (κ), fearing that it was <i>Indra</i> himself who was approaching for the sake of the <i>Kauravas. Arjuna</i> in reply described the prowess of <i>Aśvatthāman</i> and the unrighteousness of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in slaying <i>Droṇa</i> (λ); “all of us have passed the greater part of our lives; the days that remain to us are few; this exceedingly unrighteous act has stained that remnant”; “I did not interfere, as he was about to be slain; for this fault I have already sunk into hell, overcome with shame” (VII, <b>196</b>). <i>Bhīmasena</i>, reproaching <i>Arjuna</i>, vindicated the deed (μ); “I can, with my arrows, rout the united D. with <i>Indra</i> at their head, and As., U., and men.” Then <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> spoke in justification of his conduct (ν) (VII, <b>197</b>). Asked by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (ξ), <i>Sañjaya</i> related: All the other persons present remained silent; <i>Arjuna</i>, glancing obliquely towards <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, seemed to reproach him with tears and sighs; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ο) stood ashamed; <i>Sātyaki</i> wrathfully rebuked <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (π). <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i> in reply taunted <i>Sātyaki</i> with the slaughter of <i>Bhūriśrasas</i> (ρ). <i>Sātyaki</i> rushed towards <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> in order to slay him; <i>Bhīma</i>, urged by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, held him back; <i>Sahadeva</i> endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation (σ); <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> asked <i>Bhīma</i> to let him slay <i>Sātyaki</i> (τ); then he or <i>Arjuna</i> would slay the enemies. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> restored peace with great difficulty, and all the warriors proceeded to battle (VII, <b>198</b>). <i>Aśvatthāman</i> caused a great carnage among the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops (description); before <i>Duryodhana</i> he repeated his vow (υ). <i>Duryodhana</i> rallied his troops. <i>Aśvatthāman</i> invoked the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> weapon (description). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ϕ), became exceedingly agitated. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, relying on <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, advised <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> to flee away with his <i>Pāñcālas</i>, and <i>Sātyaki</i> with the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> and <i>Andhakas</i>; he and his brothers would ascend a funeral pile (χ). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> prevailed upon the troops to lay down their weapons and alight from their chariots. <i>Bhīmasena</i> alone refused to do so, and dissuaded the others (ψ). <i>Arjuna</i> said that his vow was that the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> should not be used against the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> weapon, kine, and brahmans. <i>Bhīma</i> attacked <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, but was overwhelmed by the energy of the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> weapon (VII, <b>199</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> covered <i>Bhīmasena</i> with the <i>Vāruṇa</i> weapon, <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, alighting from their chariot, proceeded on foot towards <i>Bhīma</i> and forcibly brought him down from his chariot, making him abandon his weapons. Then the <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> weapon became neutralized; all the quarters became clear, etc. The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> host stood arrayed once more. <i>Duryodhana</i> urged <i>Aśvatthāman</i> to use the same weapon once more; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> said that it could not be used twice; if brought back it would without doubt slay himself. <i>Duryodhana</i> then urged him to slay the enemies with other weapons. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked, what then came to pass (ω); <i>Sañjaya</i> related: <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> & <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who deprived <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> of his steeds, driver, and chariot; the <i>Pāñcālas</i> fled away. <i>Sātyaki</i> & <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who was worsted by him. <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (αα), & <i>Sātyaki</i>, who made them flee away deprived of their chariots. <i>Aśvatthāman</i> (upon another chariot) & <i>Sātyaki</i>, who once more deprived him of his chariot and caused him to retreat; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> blew their conches, and <i>Sātyaki</i> slew 300 of <i>Vṛṣasena's</i> division, etc. (αα). <i>Aśvatthāman</i> (upon another chariot) & <i>Sātyaki; Aśvatthāman</i> repeated his vow (ββ); <i>Sātyaki</i> was carried away by his driver. <i>Aśvatthāman</i> & <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, who was much afflicted; <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (γγ), & <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who slew <i>Sudarśana</i> (the <i>Mālava</i> king), <i>Paurava (Bṛhatkṣattra</i>), and the young <i>Cedi</i> prince. <i>Bhīma</i> & <i>Aśvatthāman; Bhīma</i> was carried away by his steeds; the <i>Pāñcālas</i> fled away (VII, <b>200</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> (<i>+ Kṛṣṇa</i>) (rallying his troops) & <i>Aśvatthāman</i> (+ the <i>Kauravas</i>); <i>Arjuna</i> addressed <i>Aśvatthāman</i> in harsh words (δδ). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> about the cause of this, as <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Aśvatthāman</i> loved each other. <i>Sañjaya</i> said that it was in consequence of his grief (εε). <i>Aśvatthāman</i> became angry with <i>Arjuna</i> and especially with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, touched water, and made use of the <i>Āgneya</i> weapon, from which dire omens in nature appeared, and a great slaughter in the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army resulted; Rā. and Pś. uttered fierce cries, etc. (description). <i>Arjuna</i> invoked the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon: the darkness was dispelled, etc.; a full <i>akṣauhiṇī</i> of the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops had been killed; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> were unwounded; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> rejoiced, the <i>Kauravas</i> wondered, <i>Aśvatthāman</i> was disconsolate, and ran away from the fight; he met <i>Vyāsa</i>, and asked him the reason; “neither As., nor G., Pś., Rā., U., Y., and birds, nor men can baffle this weapon.” <i>Vyāsa</i> told him the story of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (<i>b</i>); <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> are <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>; even <i>Aśvatthā—</i> <i>man</i> has been born as a portion of <i>Rudra</i>, and was [in a former birth] endued with great wisdom, regarding the universe to consist only of <i>Mahādeva</i>, etc., and <i>Śiva</i> had granted him numerous boons, and he had, in every <i>Yuga</i>, adored the great god in his <i>Phallic</i> form. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had sprung from <i>Rudra</i> himself, and always worshipped him, regarding his <i>Phallic</i> emblem as the origin of the universe, and he viewed the identity of <i>Bráhman</i> with the universe; D., Si., and M.-ṛ. adore <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> in order to attain to <i>Mahādeva; Kṛṣṇa</i> is the Creator of everything; the eternal <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> should be adored with sacrifices, etc. <i>Aśvatthāman</i> bowed unto <i>Rudra</i>, regarded <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> as worthy of the highest regards, and became filled with delight, the marks whereof appeared on his body. Bowing to <i>Vyāsa</i>, he caused the army to be withdrawn, and so did also the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. Having fought for five days…,<i>Droṇa</i> repaired to <i>Brahmaloka</i> (VII, <b>201</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> met with <i>Vyāsa</i> and inquired of him about the invisible person who aided him in the battle; <i>Vyāsa</i> said that it was <i>Mahādeva</i> himself, and recited a long enumeration of his attributes (ηη); if <i>Mahādeva</i> becomes angry, neither D., nor As., G., Rā., even if they hide themselves in deep caves, can have peace. In days of yore <i>Mahādeva</i> destroyed the sacrifice of <i>Dakṣa</i>; the <i>Sacrifice</i> fled away, and D. and As. fell down and submitted to <i>Mahādeva</i>, the <i>Nāgas</i> and Ṛ. became agitated, etc.; <i>Pūṣan</i> was eating the <i>puroḍāśa</i>: <i>Śiva</i> tore out his teeth; the gods assigned to <i>Rudra</i> a substantial share in sacrifices; he then re-established the sacrifice. Then <i>Vyāsa</i> related the destruction of <i>Tripura (d</i>). He [<i>Śiva</i>] is <i>Rudra</i>, etc. (ιι). Explanation of some of the names of <i>Mahādeva</i> (κκ). Blessings upon the reader, especially the readers of the <i>Śatarudriya</i> (λλ) (VII, <b>202</b>)."
