(This meaning is hypothetical; but as all the similar formations mentioned in the last named article imply the shutting out of undesired objects, it will seem that स्वागत is either to be taken in this compound as सु-आगत ‘welcome’ in an ironical sense--comp. e. g. सत्य, साधु--, or as स्व-आगत ‘come on one's own account, uninvited’.) E. अपेहि (imper. of इ with अप) and स्वागत, scil. क्रिया."
