            "content": "<b>Pṛthu Vainya</b>¦ (C. sometimes Vaiṇya), a mythical king. § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, <b>2</b>, 466 (<i>°or Vainyasya yatroktam</i> <i>ākhyānaṃ paramarṣiṇā</i> (i.e. Mārkaṇḍeya); in the third book of Mhbhr., however, the narrative alluded to is not found).— § 296 (Dyūtap.): II, <b>53</b>, 1929 (<i>Vainyaḥ</i>).—§ 574 (Jambūkh.): VI, <b>9</b>αα, 314 (<i>Vainyasya</i>).—§ 595 (Ṣoḍaśarāj.): King <i>Pṛthu</i> <i>Vaiṇya</i> in his rājasūya was installed by M.-ṛ. as emperor (<i>sāmrājye</i>); (etymology of <i>Pṛthu, kṣatriya</i>, and <i>rājan</i>). During his time the earth yielded crops in sufficiency, etc.; the <i>kuśa</i> blades were all of gold, etc.; when king <i>P</i>. went to the sea, the waves became solid; the very mountains used to open before him that he might pass through them. Once the trees, the mountains, the gods, the Asuras, the men, the Uragas, the seven ṛṣis, the Yakṣas, the Apsarases, and the Pitṛs came to <i>P</i>. and calling him their emperor (<i>samrāṭ</i>), etc., asked boons from him. Taking his <i>Ājagava</i> bow, <i>P</i>. caused them to milk the Earth (whom he made his daughter) by means of a calf (A), a milker (B), and vessels (C) for various kinds of milk (D): (1) [the trees]: the śāla-tree (A), the fig-tree (<i>plakṣaḥ</i>) (B.), a vessel of udumbara wood (C), torn buds (<i>chinnaprarohaṇaṃ</i>) (D). (2) [The mountains]: the eastern hill (<i>Udayaḥ parvataḥ</i>) (A), Meru (B), a stone (<i>aśmamayaṃ</i>) vessel (C), gems and herbs (D). (3) [The gods]: a god (Indra?) (B), things capable of bestowing strength (D). (4) The Asuras: <i>Virocana</i> (A), <i>Dvimūrdhan</i> (B), an unbaked pot (C), wine (<i>madyaṃ</i>) (D). (5) Men: <i>Manu Svāyambhuva</i> (A), <i>Pṛthu</i> (B), cultivation and crops (D). (6) The serpents: <i>Takṣaka</i> (A), <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (B), a gourd (C), poison (D). (7) The seven ṛṣis: <i>Soma</i> (A), <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (B), <i>chandas</i> (C), the Vedas (D). (8) The Yakṣas: <i>Vṛṣadhvaja</i> (A), <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> (i.e. Kubera) (B), an unbaked pot (C), the power of disappearing at will (<i>antardhānaṃ</i>). (D). (9) The Gandharvas and the Apsarases: <i>Citraratha</i> (A), <i>Viśvaruci</i> (B), a lotus (C), perfumes (D). (10) The Pitṛs: <i>Yama Vaivasvata</i> (A), <i>Antaka</i> (B), silvern vessels (C), <i>svadhā</i> (D). “To this day the creatures exist in the same way.” <i>P</i>. caused golden images to be made of every article on earth and bestowed them all on the brahmans at his great horse-sacrifice, also 66,000 elephants of gold; also the whole world (VII, <b>69</b>): VII, <b>69</b>, 2394 (<i>Vaiṇyaṃ</i>), 2395, 2396 (<i>Vaiṇyaṃ</i>), 2406 (<i>Vaiṇyaḥ</i>), 2408, 2414, 2421 (<i>Vaiṇyaḥ</i>).—§ 632<i>b</i> (Ṣoḍaśarāj., cf. § 595): XII, <b>29</b>, 1030 (<i>Vainyaṃ</i>), 1031, 1032 (<i>Vainyaṃ</i>, repetition from § 595).— § 641<i>f</i> (cf. Vena). When <i>P</i>. had sprung from the right hand of Vena, the M.-ṛ., R., and the gods told him to observe righteousness and punish the wicked, etc. <i>Śukra</i> became his priest, the <i>Vālakhilyas</i> his counsellors, the <i>Sārasvatas</i> his companions (<i>Sārasvatyo gaṇas tathā</i>), the M.-ṛ. <i>Garga</i> became his astrologer (<i>sāṃvatsaraḥ); Sūta</i> and <i>Māgadha</i> (who came into existence before <i>P</i>.) became his panegyrists, he gave to <i>Sūta</i> the land lying on the sea-coast (<i>Anūpadeśaṃ</i>), to <i>Māgadha Magadha. P</i>. made the earth even (in every manvantara the earth becomes uneven), removing the rocks lying around with the horn of his bow; by this means the hills and the mountains became enlarged. Then <i>Viṣṇu</i>, etc. (δ) crowned <i>P</i>. and gave him rich gifts; steeds, chariots, etc., came into existence as soon as <i>P</i>. thought of them. At this time there was neither decrepitude nor famine, etc., nobody had any fear from reptiles and thieves, etc.; when he proceeded to the sea, the waters used to be solidified, the mountains granted him passage, etc. He drew from the earth as a milker from a cow seventeen kinds of crops for the <i>Y., Rā.</i>, and <i>N.</i>, etc. He caused all creatures to regard righteousness as the foremost of all things; he was called <i>rājan</i> (etymology) and <i>kṣatriya</i> (etymology), etymology of the name Pṛthivī. <i>Viṣṇu</i> confirmed his power and entered his body in consequence of his penances; for this reason the entire universe bows to the king as to a god. At this time a gold lotus was born from <i>Viṣṇu's</i> brow, from that lotus was born the goddess <i>Śrī</i>, who became the spouse of <i>Dharma</i> (“righteousness”); their son was <i>Artha</i> (“profit”); all the three were established in sovereignty. The king is really a portion of Viṣṇu on earth. He who once beheld his (<i>P.'s?</i>) amiable face became (becomes?) obedient to him: XII, <b>59</b>, 2234 (<i>Vainyaḥ</i>).—§ 656<i>f</i> (Khaḍgotpattik.): It was Pṛthu Vainya who first created the bow; he also milked the earth for very many [sorts of] grain (<i>śasyāni</i>) and protected the earth virtuously as before: XII, <b>166</b>, 6205.— § 673<i>b</i> (Bali-Vāsavasaṃv.): XII, <b>227</b>, 8261 (among the ancient rulers of the earth).—§ 761 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, <b>115</b>δ, 5667 (did not eat meat during the month of Kārttika). —§ 770 (do.): XIII, <b>151</b>μ, 7125 (<i>Vainyaṃ nṛpavaraṃ</i> <i>Pṛthvī yasyābhavat sutā | Prajāpatiṃ sarvabhaumaṃ</i>).— § 795 (do.): XIII, <b>166</b>η, 7680 (<i>ādirājaḥ P°ur Vainyaḥ</i>). Cf. Prajāpati, Vainya."
