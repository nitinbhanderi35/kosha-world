(cf. <i>Māndhātuḥ…upākhyānaṃ</i>, I, 446).—§ 407 (Tīrthay.): Questioned by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Lomaśa</i> said: King (<i>rājarṣi</i>, v. 10429) <i>Yuvanāśva Saudyumni</i>, of <i>Ikṣvāku's</i> race, performed besides other sacrifices 1,000 horse-sacrifices. As he had no sons, he made over the duties of the state to his ministers, and retired to the woods. Having once observed a fast, he entered the hermitage of <i>Bhṛgu</i>, while the great ṛṣis were asleep, and drank a jar of water, which the son of <i>Bhṛgu (maharṣiḥ</i>), after having performed severe austerities, had destined to be drunk by <i>Yuvanāśva's</i> queen in order that she should bear him a son, who by his bravery might send even <i>Indra</i> to the abode of <i>Yama</i>. A sacrifice was then performed for him; after 100 years a son pierced <i>Yuvanāśva's</i> left side (nor did <i>Yuvanāśva</i> die). <i>Indra</i> came, and put the boy's forefinger into his mouth, saying “me he shall suck” (<i>mām ayaṃ dhāsyati</i>, whence the boy was called <i>Māndhātṛ</i>). Thereby <i>Māndhātṛ</i> became very strong, and grew 13 cubits (<i>kiṣkūn</i>), and acquired the whole of the <i>Vedas</i> including the <i>Dhanurveda</i> by his thought alone, and on the same day he obtained the bow <i>Ājagava</i> and a number of shafts made of horn, and an impenetrable coat of mail. He was placed on the throne by <i>Indra</i> himself, and conquered the three worlds in a righteous way; the gems of their own accord came into his possession, and he performed a number of sacrifices with abundant gratuities, and sat at <i>Indra's</i> side. His sacrificial grounds (<i>caityaiḥ</i>) were to be found all over the earth, and he is said to have given away to the Brahmans 10,000 <i>padmas</i> of kine. After twelve years' drought he caused rain to come down, paying no heed to <i>Indra</i>. He slew the <i>Gāndhāra</i> king of the lunar dynasty. Here, in the midst of <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, is the spot where he sacrificed to the gods (III, <b>126</b>)."
