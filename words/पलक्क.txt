Its ruler was Ugrasena. Palakka has been identified with Palakkaḍa, the capital of a Pallava viceroyalty and was situated in the Nellore district.<sup>632</sup> Law is inclined to identify Palakkaḍa with Palakalūru in the Guntur taluka.<sup>633</sup> Allan and G. Ramdas locate it in the Nellore district.<sup>634</sup> Smith places Palakka in the Nellore district.<sup>635</sup> Dubreuil, however, identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned in many Pallava Copper Plates.<sup>636</sup> The kingdom of Palakka might have extended westwards beyond the region now occupied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.<sup>637</sup> It was perhaps situated to the west of Kāñcī on the Eastern Ghāṭs.<sup>638</sup>"
