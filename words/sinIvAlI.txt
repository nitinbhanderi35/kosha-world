Her body is small. So sometimes she can be seen and sometimes she cannot be seen. It is in this meaning that she gets the name Dṛśyādṛśyā (seen and unseen). Śiva bears her in his forehead. So she has another name Rudrasutā. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 218, Verse 5). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Śiva used Sinīvālī as the yoke of the horses of his chariot in the battle with Tripuras. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 32). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) At the time of his birth Sinīvālī had come to see the child Subrahmaṇya. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 13). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) It is mentioned in Atharva Veda that Sinīvālī is a wife of Mahāviṣṇu."
