Of these Priyavrata married the beautiful and virtuous daughters of Viśvakarmā the Prajāpati. They were Surūpā and Barhiṣmatī. Of his first wife Surūpā, he got ten sons Agnīdhra and others. The youngest child was a daughter named Ūrjjasvatī. Of the sons, Kavi, Savana and Mahāvīra became detached from worldly life and became learned in spiritual knowledge. Priyavrata got of his second wife Barhiṣmatī three sons named Uttama, Tāmasa and Raivata. They were very valiant and they gradually became chiefs of Manvantaras. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata)."
