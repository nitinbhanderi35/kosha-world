The term applies especially to a ceremony performed by a <i>king</i> and a <i>military commander</i> and concerns, as such, the rites of the <i>second</i> caste only; (comp. <i>Sāyaṇa</i> on the <i>Aitar. Br.</i> chap. 33 seqq.: उक्तं द्वात्रिंशदध्यायैः कर्म वर्णत्रयान्वितम् । अथ त्वष्टभिरध्यायैर्वर्ण्यते राजकर्तृकम्, the ceremony being described in the chapters 37-39). The general object of the ceremony is attainment of supreme power in this and the future world, as well as long life and happiness. (A detailed account of this purpose, as given in the <i>Aitar. Br.</i> is subjoined p. 278 <i>a,</i> 1. 32 ff.; for the post-vaidik period comp. e. g. <i>Mahābh. Anuśāsanap.:</i> ये राजानो राजसूयाभिषिक्ता धर्मा- त्मानो रक्षितारः प्रजानाम् । ये चाश्वमेधावभृथे प्लुताङ्गास्तेषां लोका धृतराष्ट्रो न तत्र; or <i>Harivanśa:</i> भवान्राजास्तु मान्यो मे यदूनामग्रणीः प्रभुः । विजयायाभिषिच्यस्व स्वाराज्ये राज- सत्तम; or राजसूयाभिषिक्तस्तु पृथुरेभिर्नराधिपैः वेददृष्टेन विधिना राजराज्ये नराधिप ॥). <dvsn n='P'><i>A.</i> INAUGURATION OF A KING. This ceremony is either part of a Rājasūya, and performed by a king at the end of this sacrifice--when it is called पुनरभिषेक or <i>second</i> <i>inauguration,</i> since the <i>Abhisheka</i> or first inauguration of a king must have taken place previously--; or it is not part of a sacrifice and occurs at a king's accession to the throne--then it is the अभिषेक proper. [Both ceremonies are described in the <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,</i> first the <i>Punar-</i> <i>abhisheka,</i> then the <i>Abhisheka;</i> in conformity with this authority the same order has been preserved in the following account, since the <i>Abhisheka</i> ceremony refers in many respects to that of the <i>Punarabhisheka.</i>] <dvsn n='P'><i>a.</i> The <i>Punarabhisheka</i> is performed by a king at the end of a <i>Rājasūya,</i> after he has undergone preliminary purification (दीक्षा), when he has risen from the <i>Avabhṛtha</i> ceremonies, has performed the <i>Anūbandhya</i> sacrifice and completed the final rite, the <i>Udavasanīyā.</i> There must have been prepared for the occasion a throne-seat (आसन्दी) of the wood of the <i>Udumbara</i> (ficus glomerata), resting on four legs a span (प्रादेश) high, with boards placed on them (शीर्षण्य; see below page 277<i>b,</i> line 6 ff.) and side boards (अनूच्य; see ibid.) of the dimension of a cubit (or two spans; अरत्नि, <i>Sāyaṇa:</i> प्रादेशद्वयमरत्निः); the whole well fastened together with a texture made of cords of <i>Munja</i> grass (Saccharum munja), a tiger skin which is placed on the seat with the hairs upwards and the neck to the east, a large (four cornered) ladle (चमसः; <i>Sāy.</i> at a later occasion: = चतुष्कोणो दण्डयुक्तः पात्रविशेषः) of <i>Udumbara</i> wood and a branch of the same; in the ladle have been put eight things: curd (दधि), honey (मधु), clarified butter (सर्पिस्), water proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen down (आतपवर्ष्या आपः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = आतपयुक्तवर्षभवाः); blades of <i>Syāma</i> grass (शष्याणि; <i>Sāy.:</i> = श्यामतृणानि), sprouts (तोक्मानि; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अङ्कुराणि), spirituous liquor (सुरा) and <i>Dūb</i> grass (दूर्वा, Panicum dactylon). (To prepare a site for the throne three lines have been drawn on a place of sacrifice with the sacrificial implement called <i>Sphya</i> (q. v.), one southwards, another westwards and a third northwards); the one to the south is that on which the throne is to be placed with its front towards the east, so that the two feet to the north come to stand within the Vedi or sacrificial ground and the two to the south without; this latter spot occupied by the throne-seat is called <i>Śrī;</i> (as a type of happiness or prosperity; <i>Sāy.:</i> श्रीर्वै संपद्रूपैव). The place within the Vedi being small, but that without being illimited, this position of the throne indicates that the sacrificer may obtain definite and indefinite wishes within and without the Vedi. The tiger skin is the type of increase of Kshatriya power, for the tiger is the Kshatriya or hero of the wild beasts; the Udumbara wood of the throne, ladle and branch is the type of essential juice (ऊर्ज् <i>Sāy.:</i> = क्षीरादिरसः) and of food (which the sacrificer is supposed to acquire by this symbol); curd, honey and clarified butter typify the essence of water and plants; (curd and butter, as <i>Sāyaṇa</i> observes, because they originate in grass and water which are the food of cattle; honey, because it originates in the juice of plants collected by bees); water proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen down typifies (on account of the sunshine) lustre (or energy; तेजस्) and (rain being the consequence of oblations to the gods) holiness (ब्रह्मवर्चसम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = श्रुताध्ययनसंपत्तिः); grass and sprouts typify food (इरा; they being the food of cattle), hence prosperity (पुष्टि, increase) and progency (प्रजा); spirituous liquor is the type of a Kshatriya's power (on account of its fierceness or hotness; <i>Sāy.:</i> सुरया क्षत्रियस्यैव मदयोगात्क्षत्ररूपत्वम्) and of the essence of food (or rice, liquor being made of rice; comp. अन्नरस; अन्नस्य रसः; <i>Sāy.:</i> अन्नजन्यत्वादन्नरसत्वम्); <i>Dūb</i> grass (being the Kshatriya of the plants and firmly established in the soil with its many roots) is the type of Kshatriya-power and of a firmly established rule.--The principal features of the ceremony itself are the following. The king who performs the sacrifice kneels down at the back part of the throne-seat with his face to the east and his right knee touching the ground (while his left knee remains upwards); he then touches with his hands the throne-seat and invites the gods to ascend it together with various metres: <i>Agni</i> with the metre Gāyatrī, <i>Savitṛ</i> with the Uṣṇih, <i>Soma</i> with the Anuṣṭubh, <i>Bṛhaspati</i> with the Bṛhatī, <i>Mitra</i> and <i>Varuṇa</i> with the Pankti, <i>Indra</i> with the Triṣṭubh, the <i>Viśve-</i> <i>Devās</i> with the Jagatī, for the purpose of obtaining kingly power (राज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = देशाधिपत्यम्), righteous government (साम्राज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = धर्मेण पालनम्), increase of enjoyment (भौज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = भोगसमृद्धिः), independent rule (स्वाराज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अपराधीनत्वम्), attainment of more distinguished qualities than those possessed by other kings (वैराज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = इतरेभ्यो भूपतिभ्यो वैशिष्ट्यम्), coming (after death) into the world of Brahman (पारमेष्ठ्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> एतदुक्तमैहिकम्--i. e. what precedes--अथामुष्मिकमुच्यते । पारमेष्ठ्यं प्रजापतिलोकप्राप्तिः) and obtaining there dominion (राज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = तत्र राज्यमैश्वर्यम्), a mighty rule (माहा- राज्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = तत्रत्येभ्य इतरेभ्य आधिक्यम्), mastership (आधिपत्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = तानितरान्प्रति स्वामित्वम्), independence (स्वावश्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अपारतन्त्यम्) and a long residence there (आतिष्ठम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> चिरकालवासित्वम्). [Of the metres mentioned before each following metre has four syllables more than each preceding one; the invitation itself which is addressed to the gods is founded on the <i>Ṛgv.</i> 10. 130. 4.; and the company of the gods is solicited by the king in order to ensure the attainment of what was before unattained by him (योगः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अप्राप्तस्य लाभस्य प्राप्तिः) and the preservation of what he has obtained (क्षेमः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = प्रा- प्तस्य वस्तुनो रक्षणम्).] The gods have arrived and the king now ascends himself the throne-seat, first with his right and then with his left knee.--The next ceremony is the propitiation of the liquid in the ladle, which is performed by the priest who will pour it over the king, by reciting the hymn: ‘waters behold me with a favourable eye, with a favourable body touch my skin; all fires, for they reside in water, I invoke on your account; do you produce in me beauty, bodily strength and energy’; and by the king repeating these words after him. If this propitiation did not take place, the liquid would destroy the vigour of the king. (The quoted verse occurs, though with some variations, in the <i>Atharvav.</i> 10. 1. 12 and 13.) After this, the priest covers the head of the king with the <i>Udumbara</i>-branch and pours the liquid over him while reciting the following three <i>Ṛg-</i> <i>veda</i>-verses: ‘These waters are most propitious, they have healing power to free from all disease (<i>Sāy.</i> ‘poverty and other diseases’: दारिद्र्यादिरोगस्य भेषजीः); they are the augmenters of kingly power, and (therefore) its supporters; they are immortal.’ ‘With which Prajāpati sprinkled Indra, the king Soma and Manu, with these I sprinkle thee, that thou becomest king of kings in this world.’ ‘The queen, thy mother, bore thee to be great amongst the great, and a righteous ruler over men; an auspicious mother bore thee’; and this <i>Yajurveda</i>-verse: ‘The divine Savitṛ has given his consent, therefore I pour (this liquid) over thee with the arms of the Aśvins (<i>Sāyaṇa:</i> not with my own), with the hands of Pūṣan, with the beauty of Agni (तेजस्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = शारीरकान्तिः), with the radiance of Sūrya (वर्चस्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = वाह्यप्रकाशः) and with the (sharp) senses of Indra (इन्द्रियम्; <i>Sāy.</i> ‘with the sharpness of the eyes’ &c.: = चक्षुरादिपाटवम्), for the sake of strength (बलम्), prosperity (श्रीः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = हस्त्यश्वादिसंपद्), glory and increase of food (अन्नम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अन्नसमृद्धिः)’. If the priest wishes that the king may enjoy good health (lit. may eat food), he must, after these verses, utter the sacred word <i>Bhūr!</i> (earth!). If he wishes that the king may enjoy good health and live to see a son and a grandson (द्विपुरुष) he must utter the sacred words: <i>Bhūr! Bhuvas!</i> (earth! intermediate region between earth and sun!), and if he wishes him to enjoy good health and live to see three generations (त्रि- पुरुष), or if he wishes him to remain unrivalled, he must utter the sacred words: <i>Bhūr! Bhuvas! Swar!</i> (earth! intermediate region! heaven!). [The <i>text</i> of the <i>Aitar. Br.</i> mentions on this occasion that some authorities object to the enunciation of the latter words; but it quotes, too, the opinion of the Ṛṣi <i>Satyakāma,</i> the son of <i>Jābālā,</i> who maintains that a king who is not inaugurated with these <i>Vyāhṛtis</i> or sacred words, will die before the due term of his life, and that of <i>Uddālaka,</i> the son of <i>Aruṇa,</i> who says that a king who is inaugurated with these words, will arrive at the full term of his life and conquer his enemies.] Since at the pouring of the liquid the essence of water, holiness and the other boons which are conferred on the king by the ingredients placed in the ladle, are shed and go away, as it were, from the king, he must, to secure them, before the liquid is poured over him, make two oblations (while uttering the words: ब्रह्म प्रपद्ये स्वाहा क्षत्रं प्रपद्ये स्वाहा i. e. I am obtaining holiness, Svāhā! I am obtaining power, Svāhā!). After the liquid has been poured over the king, the priest places in his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor and recites the following verse (<i>Ṛgv.</i> 9. 1. 1. = <i>Sāmav.</i> 2. 39. = <i>Vājas.</i> 26. 25.): ‘Soma with thy most sweet exhilarating drops purify (this sacrificer), for thou wast poured out for Indra to drink.’ Then he recites and makes the king repeat after him the following invocation: ‘(Soma and spirituous liquor), because a separate residence has been allotted to you by the gods, therefore do not combine in the lofty æther; liquor, thou art powerful, but thou, Soma, art a king; do not harm him (the king), when you enter into your several receptacles (i. e. into his stomach).’ [This verse occurs with some variations in the <i>Vājas.</i> 19. 7.] By the recital of these verses spirituous liquor and Soma become identified; compare page 279<i>a,</i> line 52ff. Having drunk the king then presents the rest to a man whom he considers his friend, for drinking out of the same cup is the mutual practice of friends. He then places the Udumbara branch on the ground as a symbol of essential juice (ऊर्ज्) and food, and prepares himself for descending from the throne-seat; but while he is still seated and puts his feet on the ground he says: ‘I firmly stand on heaven and earth, I firmly stand on exhaled and inhaled air (प्राण and अपान), I firmly stand on day and night, I firmly stand on food and drink; on what is Brahmaṇa, on what is Kshatriya, on these three worlds stand I firmly.’ He then descends, sits down on the ground with his face towards the east, utters thrice the words ‘adoration to what is Brāhmaṇa’ and offers a gift (<i>Sāy.:</i> a cow) to a Brāhmaṇa; the object of this gift is the attainment of victory in general (जितिः), of victory everywhere (अभिजितिः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अभितः सर्वेषु देशेषु जितिः); of victory over strong and weak enemies (विजितिः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = प्रबलदुर्बलशत्रूणां तारतम्येन विविधो जयः) and of complete victory (संजितिः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = शत्रुत्वराहित्याय सम्यग्जयः); and his threefold expression of adoration to what is a Brāhmaṇa implies that a kingdom prospers and has valiant men when it is under the control of the Brāhmaṇas, and that a valiant son will be born to him. After this ceremony the king rises and puts fuel into the Āhavanīya fire while uttering the words: ‘(wood) thou art fuel, bestow on me sharpness of sense and strength of body’. Then he is going to take three steps to the east, north (and as <i>Sāy.</i> explains), to the north-cast, but previously to doing so points to the region, and addresses the step he is about to take with these words: ‘thou subduest for me the regions; enable me therefore to adore the gods, and may attainment of my desires and preservation of what I have attained be granted to me; may there be no danger (or fear) to me’. [The injunctions which follow in the text of the <i>Aitar. Br.</i> are merely incidental and refer to the conduct of a king and the ceremonies he has to perform, when his assistance in warfare is sought for by another king.] Upon this and having recited the <i>Ṛgveda</i>verse (10. 131. 1.), with the purpose of freeing himself from enemies, he returns to his palace, when he will be without foes and peril and day by day increase in prosperity, authority and sovereignty. There he sits down by the domestic fire and the Adhwaryu priest makes for him, out of a goblet, four times three oblations with clarified butter to Indra while reciting the three <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verses 9. 110. 1-3. or <i>Sāmav.</i> 2. 714. 716. 715. [The recital of these verses takes place in a peculiar manner, called प्रपदम्, which consists in inserting between the syllables of some word in the second Pāda of either of these verses certain other words which are foreign to the text of the <i>Ṛgv.</i>-hymn, viz. the words भूर्ब्रह्म प्राणममृतं प्रपद्यतेऽयमसौ शर्म वर्माभयं स्वस्तये सह प्रजया सह पशुभिः between the second and third syllables of the word वृत्राणि in the second Pāda of <i>Ṛgv.</i> 9. 110. 1.; the words भुवो ब्रह्म &c. …पशुभिः between the second and third syllables of the word समर्यराज्ये in the second Pāda of <i>Ṛgv.</i> 9. 110. 2.; and the words स्वर्ब्रह्म &c. …पशुभिः between the first and second syllables of the word शक्मना in the second Pāda of <i>Ṛgv.</i> 9. 110. 3.; the sense of these words is: ‘he (the king) seeks the protection of earth (भूर्; in the second verse…of भुवस् or the intermediate region; in the third of स्वर् or heaven), of the Veda, of life, of Amṛta; for the sake of his bliss grant him (o Indra) happiness, armour and safety with his children and his cattle’.] A king for whom these libations are made to Indra in the indicated manner becomes free from disease, cannot be injured by enemies, is exempt from poverty, everywhere protected against danger, and thus becomes victorious in all the quarters, and after death established in Indra's heaven.--At the end of the whole ceremony the king prays for increase in cows, horses and progeny and more especially to obtain a son who would be liberal towards the priests at his sacrifices and a powerful protector of his subjects.--Priests who understand well how to perform the whole rite will raise the king to an exalted position; those on the contrary who are ignorant of the manner in which it is to be performed, will bring him unto perdition. (As an instance of the efficacy of this part of the Rājasūya sacrifice when performed by priests who well understand their duties, the text of the <i>Aitar.</i> <i>Br.</i> quotes the instance of <i>Janamejaya,</i> the son of <i>Parīkṣit.</i>) <dvsn n='P'><i>b.</i> The rites of the <i>Abhisheka</i> which is not part of a Rājasūya sacrifice, but a ceremony performed at a king's accession to the throne, are similar to, but not identical with, those of the <i>Punarabhisheka;</i> they are founded on the proceedings which took place when Indra was consecrated by the gods as their supreme ruler, and which form the subject of the 38<sup>th</sup> chapter of the <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.</i> It is there told that the throne-seat which served at Indra's inauguration was made of <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verses, its eight parts consisting of <i>Sāmaveda</i>-verses, viz. the two fore-legs of the <i>Bṛhat</i> and <i>Rathantara,</i> the two hind-legs of the <i>Vai-</i> <i>rūpa</i> and <i>Vairāja,</i> the two top boards of the <i>Śākvara</i> and <i>Raivata,</i> and the two side boards of the <i>Naudhasa</i> and <i>Kāleya.</i> [In the corresponding passage of the <i>Punarabhi-</i> <i>sheka, Sāyaṇa</i> speaks of <i>several</i> शोर्षण्य and renders the word ‘boards placed on the legs of the throne-seat’: तेषां पा- दानां शिरस्युपरिभागेऽवस्थितानि शीर्षण्यानि; in the present passage the text has the dual शीर्षण्ये which <i>Sāyaṇa</i> explains as the board where the head of Indra and, by implication, as the board where his feet rest upon: आस- न्द्यां शयानस्येन्द्रस्य शिरोदेशस्थं फलकं शीर्षण्यम् । तच्च पाद- देशाविकृतस्य फलकस्याप्युपलक्षणम्; <i>Sāyaṇa</i> likewise speaks in his comm. on the first passage of several अनूच्य, while the text of the latter mentions distinctly two, viz. अनूच्ये; the former explanation of शीर्षण्य seems more natural, since the latter is at variance with the dimensions of the throneseat stated before, but it is probably more correct to view the compound शीर्षण्यानूच्यानि which occurs in the chapter on the Punarabhisheka, as representing two duals]; of the threads of the texture which was to hold this structure together, those that went lengthwise were made of <i>Ṛgveda</i>and those that went crossways of <i>Sāmaveda-,</i> the intervals being <i>Yajurveda</i>-verses; the covering of the throne was (the goddess of) <i>Glory,</i> the pillow (<i>Sāy.:</i> where his head rested upon) <i>Śrī</i> (the goddess of Happiness). <i>Savītṛ</i> and <i>Bṛhaspati</i> supported the fore-legs, <i>Vāyu</i> and <i>Pūṣan</i> the hind-legs, <i>Mitra</i> and <i>Varuṇa</i> the two top boards and the two <i>Aśvins</i> the two side boards of the throne-seat, while Indra ascended it after having invited the <i>Vasus</i> to take place on it with the metre Gāyatrī, the Stoma (q. v.) Trivṛt and the Sāman (q. v.) Rathantara for the sake of obtaining righteous government (साम्राज्य), the <i>Rudras</i> for increase of enjoyment (भौज्य), the <i>Adityas</i> for independent rule (स्वाराज्य), the <i>Viśve-Devas</i> for the attainment of distinguished qualities (वैराज्य), the <i>Sādhyas</i> and <i>Āptyas</i> for dominion (राज्य), the <i>Maruts</i> and <i>Āṅgirasas</i> for coming into the world of Brahman (पारमेष्ट्य), superiority (माहाराज्य), mastership (आधिपत्य), independence (स्वावश्य) and a long residence there (आतिष्ठ), these divinities being accompanied severally, like the Vasus, with various metres, Stomas and Sāmans (as specified in the text of the <i>Ait. Br.</i>). All these gods having then proclaimed the high qualities of Indra, to strike terror, by their panegyric, into the mind of his enemies, and Prajāpati who performed the function of inaugurating priest, having recited the <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verse 1. 25. 10. (where between the ending words साम्राज्याय and सुक्रतुः the words भौज्याय, स्वाराज्याय &c. &c. are inserted), the latter placed himself before (i. e. east of) the throne with his face towards the west, covered the head of Indra with a moist <i>Udumbara</i> branch (i. e. with an Udumbara branch the leaves of which had been wetted) and a gold Pavitra (q. v.) and sprinkled him with the liquid, while reciting the three <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verses ‘these waters &c.’, the <i>Yajurveda</i>-verse ‘the divine Savitṛ &c.’ and uttering the three sacred words, <i>Bhūr, Bhuvas, Swar</i> (see above page 276 <i>a,</i> line 22 ff.). Thirtyone days after this inauguration by Prajāpati, the divine <i>Vasus</i> sprinkled him in the East with the same liquid while reciting the same verses and uttering the same sacred words, to ensure his righteous government (साम्राज्य), hence the inaugurated kings of the Eastern peoples are called <i>Samrāj;</i> next in thirty-one days the <i>Rudras</i> performed the same ceremony in the South to ensure his increase of enjoyment (भौज्य), hence the inaugurated kings of the <i>Satwats</i> in the South are called <i>Bhoja;</i> then in other thirty-one days the <i>Ādityas</i> performed this ceremony in the West, to ensure his independent rule (स्वाराज्य), hence the inaugurated kings of the <i>Nīchyas</i> and <i>Apāchyas</i> in the West are called <i>Svarāj;</i> then in other thirty-one days, the <i>Viśve-Devas</i> in the North, to ensure his attainment of higher qualities than those possessed by others (वैराज्य), hence the inaugurated kings of the <i>Uttarakurus</i> and <i>Uttaramadras</i> are called <i>Virāj;</i> afterwards in other thirty-one days the <i>Sādhyas</i> and <i>Āptyas</i> performed the same ceremony in the central region (which is the ‘fixed’ region, since east, west &c. become determined through it, and which at the same time is the region where the vaidik rites are established), for the sake of his rulership (राज्य), hence the inaugurated kings of the <i>Kurus</i> and <i>Pañchālas</i> and of the <i>Vaśas</i> and <i>Uśīnaras</i> in that region are called <i>Rājan.</i> Lastly, in further thirty-one days the <i>Maruts</i> and the <i>Angirasas</i> performed this ceremony in the upper region (or Swarga) to ensure his attainment of the supreme abode (पारमेष्ठ्य), his mighty rule there over every one (माहाराज्य), as well as his mastership (आधिपत्य), independence (स्वावश्य) and long residence there (आतिष्ठ), hence he attained the supreme abode (परमेष्ठिन्) and became united with Prajāpati (प्राजापत्य). ‘Thus inaugurated by that great inauguration Indra conquered all conquerable battle grounds (जितीः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = जेतव्याः सर्वा युद्धभूमीः), took possession of all worlds, obtained the highest dignity amongst gods (श्रैष्ठ्यम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = अतिशयेन प्रशस्तत्वम्), transcendent rank (अतिष्ठाम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = सर्वानतिक्रम्यावस्थानम्) and preeminence (परमताम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> = उत्कृष्टत्वम्), conquered righteous government, increase of enjoyment, absolute dominion, distinguished qualities, supreme abode, rulership and mighty rule and mastership there; and thus he became in this world a Prajāpati, an absolute king, long-lived (अमृतः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = इतरमनुष्यवदल्पकाले मरणरहितः), and in the other world having obtained all his desires, he became entirely exempt from death’ (or liberated; अमृतः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = मरणरहितो मुक्तः). <dvsn n='P'>The purpose for which the inauguration of a mortal king takes place, is defined by the <i>Aitar. Br.</i> in precisely the same terms as those contained in the preceding passage, [with the obvious alteration of ‘amongst kings’ instead of ‘amongst gods’. This definition occurs ch. 39. 5.; in the commencement of ch. 39. 1. the purpose of the ceremony is worded somewhat differently at the end of the passage but its bearing is similar, viz.: if he (i. e. a priest) wishes that a king should conquer all conquerable battle grounds &c. &c…(up to the words: ‘and mastership there’), that he should attain (every thing) in space and time (अयं समन्तपर्यायी स्यात्; <i>Sāy.:</i> देशतः कालतः सर्वव्यापी स्यात्), all land up to the seashore and all life to infinity (lit. to the amount परार्ध; सार्वभौमः सार्वायुष आन्तादा प- रार्धात्; <i>Sāy.:</i> समुद्रतीरपर्यन्तं सार्वभौमत्वं देशव्याप्तिः । आ परार्धात्परार्धशब्दाभिधेयकालसंख्यापर्यन्तं सार्वायुषत्वं काल- व्याप्तिः), and that he should become a sole ruler over the whole earth up to the ocean (पृथिव्यै समुद्रपर्यन्ताया एक- राट्), let him &c. &c…and: if a king wishes, that he should conquer &c. &c., let him &c.].--The ceremony as practised at the <i>vaidik period,</i> is thus described in the <i>Ait.</i> <i>Br.</i> The priest in the commencement of the solemnity causes the king to take the following oath: ‘if I (the king) do ever harm to thee, thou (the priest) mayst deprive me of all pious acts (इष्टापूर्तम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> श्रौतस्मार्तद्वयम्) which I have done from the time of my birth up to that of my death, of heaven and whatever else good has been accomplished by me, of long life and offspring’. He then orders his attendants to bring four kinds of fruits: the fruit of the <i>Nyagrodha</i> (ficus Indica), of the <i>Udumbara</i> (ficus glomerata), of the <i>Aśvattha</i> (ficus religiosa) and of the <i>Plaksha</i> (ficus infectoria); besides, four kinds of grain (औषधानि …तोक्मकृतानि; <i>Sāy.:</i> अङ्कुरनिमित्तान्यौषधिद्रव्याणि): rice with small grain (व्रीद्दीणाम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> सूक्ष्मवीजरूपा व्री- हयः), rice with large grain (महाव्रीहीणाम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> प्रौढ- वीजरूपा महाव्रीहयः), <i>Priyangu</i> and barley. Next they bring, at his command, a throne-seat of <i>Udumbara</i> wood (made in the manner as described above, page 275<i>a,</i> line 34 ff.), a (four-cornered) ladle of <i>Udumbara</i> or, instead of the latter, a vessel of <i>Udumbara</i> (or, acc. to <i>Sāyaṇa,</i> an earthen vessel of an arbitrary shape) and an <i>Udumbara</i> branch. Then they put the four kinds of fruit and grain in the ladle or vessel and pour over them curds, honey, clarified butter and water proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen down; afterwards, having placed the ladle or vessel on the ground, they address the throne-seat with a Mantra which recalls the component parts of Indra's throne and thus tends to identify both: ‘may thy front legs be Bṛhat and Rathantara &c. &c.; may Savitṛ and Bṛhaspati support thy fore-legs &c. &c. (see above page 277<i>b,</i> line 1 ff.)’. Then the priest asks the king to ascend the throne-seat, inviting the Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas and the other divinities which were invited by Indra at his inauguration (see page 277<i>b,</i> line 31 ff.), to ascend his throne with the same metres, Stomas and Sāmans and for the same purposes as mentioned above. Upon this the relatives of the king (literally: ‘the kingmakers’, राजकर्तारः; <i>Sāy.:</i> = पितृभ्रात्रादयः ‘father, brother &c.’), proclaim his high qualities in the same words as the gods proclaimed the greatness of Indra; the priest recites the <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verse 1. 25. 10. (with the same modifications as mentioned above) and, placing himself before the throne with his face towards the west, covers the head of the king with the Udumbara branch, the leaves of which have been wetted, and with a gold Pavitra, and sprinkles him with the liquid (in the ladle or vessel), while reciting the three <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verses, the <i>Yajurveda</i>-verse and uttering the three sacred words mentioned above (page 276<i>a,</i> line 22 ff.). Lastly he addresses the king with the prayer that the Vasus, the Rudras and the other divinities who performed this ceremony for Indra in the East, South &c. may severally do the same for him in thirty-one successive days and to the same effect as mentioned before (page 278<i>a,</i> line 1 ff.).--The ingredients of the sacred liquid used at this Abhisheka differ in some measure, as will have been seen, from those used at the <i>Punarabhisheka;</i> they differ from the latter also in their typical qualities. The <i>Nyagrodha</i> being on account of its wide spread the Rājan of the trees, and rice with small grain being among plants principally productive of strength, the fruit of the former and the grain of the latter are the type of the qualities of a Kshatra (क्षत्रम्), which the king is supposed to acquire by these ingredients; and in a similar manner the fruit of the <i>Udumbara</i> and the grains of <i>Priyangu</i> are the type of increase of enjoyment (भौज्यम्), the fruit of the <i>Aśvattha</i> and rice with large grains the type of righteous government (साम्राज्यम्), the fruit of the <i>Plaksha</i> the type of independent rule (स्वाराज्यम्) and attainment of more distinguished qualities than those possessed by other kings (वैराज्यम्), barley the type of military commandership (सैनान्यम्); curds typify the sharpness of senses (इन्द्रियम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> ‘because they make the senses sharp’: इन्द्रियपाटवहेतुत्वात्), honey typifies the essence of plants and trees (रस ओषधिवनस्पतिषु; <i>Sāy.:</i> ‘because it originates in flowers’: पुष्पजन्यत्वेन); clarified butter, the brightness of cattle (तेजः पशूनाम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> ‘on account of its oily gloss’: स्निग्धभास्करत्वेन) and the water, freedom from death or long life (अमृतम्; <i>Sāy.:</i> ‘because it nourrishes’ आप्यायनहेतुत्वात्).--The ceremony having been completed, the king has to make a present to the inaugurating priest, viz. a thousand (Nishkas) of gold, a field and cattle (चतुष्पाद्; <i>Sāy.:</i> गवादिकम् cows &c.); but this amount seems merely to constitute a minimum acknowledgement of the exertions of the priest; for the text of the Aitareya adds that ‘they say, a king should give innumerable, illimited presents, since a king is illimited (in wealth) and thus will obtain illimited benefit to himself’; and the author of the <i>Aitar.</i> <i>Br.</i> seems rather inclined to adopt the latter opinion, for, amongst the instances he gives of royal inaugurations which have been performed in this fashion, he does not mention such at which the Brāhmaṇas received the ‘limited’ gifts, but tells, e. g., that <i>Udamaya,</i> the son of Atri, promised to his priest ten thousand elephants and ten thousand female slaves and gave each of the sons of that priest every day at the noon-oblation two thousand cows out of a thousand millions; that <i>Anga</i> gave his priest eighty thousand young white horses fit for carrying burdens on their back &c.; that <i>Bharata</i> distributed in Maṣṇāra a hundred and seven thousand millions of black elephants with white tucks and decked with gold &c. &c. (comp. also <i>Colebr.</i> <i>Ess.</i> I. p. 41 ff.).--After the priest has received the gift, he hands to the king a goblet of spirituous liquor in reciting the verse: ‘Soma with thy most sweet exhilarating drops &c.’ (see above p. 276<i>b,</i> line 13ff.), and the king drinks of it after having recited this verse: ‘what is left (in this goblet) of the tasteful liquid and what Indra (drank when it was consecrated by) various rites, that portion of it I consume now with a placid mind, (as if it were) the royal Soma’, and this verse: ‘to thee, supreme (Indra), I offer this liquid for drink, for it has been poured out on thy behalf, rejoice in it until thou art happy’; [the former of these mantras occurs with a few variations in the <i>Vājas.,</i> 19. 35., the other in the <i>Ṛgv.,</i> 8. 45. 22. or <i>Sāmav.,</i> 1. 161.]. By this manner of drinking, the spirituous liquor becomes a kind of Soma, and it is the Soma not the spirituous liquor that is drunk by the king. Lastly the king recites the two <i>Ṛgveda</i>-verses 8. 48. 3. and 4. [What follows in the text of the <i>Aitareya Br.</i> up to the end of the 39<sup>th</sup> ch. are illustratations of the happiness which is felt by a king in consequence of such an inauguration, and historical instances of kings who had this ceremony performed for them and bestowed liberal gifts on the functioning priests; for this portion of the text compare also the literal translation of it in <i>Colebrooke'</i>s <i>Essays</i> 1. p. 39 seqq.<dvsn n='P'>Inaugurations of a purely mythical nature are mentioned in the <i>Upanishads, Epic poems</i> and in the <i>Purāṇas;</i> thus the <i>Harivaṇsa</i> reports, ch. 109, an inauguration of <i>Kṛṣṇa,</i> the <i>Śalyap.</i> of the <i>Mahābh.,</i> ch. 48, that of Varuṇa; a whole list is given in the <i>Vishnup.</i> 1. ch. 22 (where a note of <i>Wilson</i> refers to the corresponding passages in other <i>Purāṇas</i>); compare also <i>Bṛhadār. Up.</i> 1. 4. 11. One of the completest lists of this kind is that which occurs in the 4th chapter, and is varied in the 227<sup>th</sup> chapter, of the <i>Harivanśa.</i> According to the former, <i>Soma</i> was inaugurated as king of the Brāhmaṇas (द्विजानाम्; comm.: = ब्राह्मणानाम्), plants, constellations, planets, sacrifices and austerities; <i>Varuṇa</i> as king of the waters; <i>Kuvera</i> as king of the kings; <i>Vrīhaspati,</i> of the Angirasas; <i>Kāvya,</i> of the Bhṛgus; <i>Vīṣṇu,</i> of the Ādityas; <i>Pāvaka,</i> of the Vasus; <i>Daksha,</i> of the Prajāpatis; <i>Vāsava,</i> of the Maruts; <i>Prahrāda,</i> of the Daityas and Dānavas; <i>Yama,</i> the son of <i>Vivaśvat,</i> of the defunct ancestors (or Manes); <i>Śiva</i> (with the trident) of the Yakshas, Rākṣasas, serpents (पार्थिवानाम्; comm.: = भूधराणाम् । नागाः सर्पा- श्चानेकफणत्वे भिन्नाः), Piśāchas and all other evil genii (and, acc. to a v. l., of the Mātṛs or female energies of the gods, the religious vows, the vaidik hymns and the cows); <i>Hi-</i> <i>mavat,</i> of the mountains; <i>Sāgara,</i> of the rivers; <i>Nārāyaṇa,</i> of the Sādhyas; <i>Śiva</i> (with the bull in his banner), of the Rudras; <i>Viprachitti,</i> of the Dānavas <i>(sic); Vāyu,</i> of odours, winds, and beings that are incorporeal, have the property of sound and reside in the æther; <i>Chitraratha,</i> of the oceans, rivers, clouds, rain and Gandharvas; <i>Vāsuki,</i> of the Nāgas; <i>Takshaka,</i> of the serpents (सर्प); <i>Śeṣa,</i> of all the reptiles with large teeth; <i>Airāvata,</i> of the elephants; <i>Uchchaiḥśravas,</i> of the horses; <i>Garuḍa,</i> of the birds; the <i>tiger,</i> of the wild beasts; the <i>bull,</i> of the cows; the <i>Plaksha</i> (ficus infectoria), of the large trees; <i>Kāma,</i> of the Gandharvas and Apsarasas; <i>Samwatsara</i> (the year), of the seasons, months, days, halfmonths, nights, hours, lunar-days (तिथि) and holy days (पर्वन्), minutes, seconds, the two <i>Ayanas</i> (q. v.) and the astronomical <i>Yogas</i> (q. v.); besides, <i>Sudhanwan,</i> son of the <i>Prajāpati Vairāja,</i> was inaugurated as king of the East; <i>Śaṅkhapāda,</i> the son of <i>Kardama,</i> of the South; <i>Ketumat,</i> the son of <i>Rajas,</i> of the West; and <i>Hiraṇyaroman,</i> the son of <i>Parjanya,</i> of the North; all these kings inaugurated <i>Prīthu</i> as king of kings.--The other list (ch. 227) is similar, but it represents <i>Śiva</i> as becoming the inaugurated king of the Piśāchas and other evil genii, of the Matṛs, cows, meteors, planets, diseases, pests, calamities and ghosts; <i>Vaiśravaṇa,</i> of the Yakshas, Rākṣasas, Guhykas, of wealth and jewels; <i>Parjanya,</i> of the oceans, rivers, clouds, rain and Ādityas; <i>Chitraratha,</i> of the Gandharvas; <i>Kāmadeva,</i> of the Apsarasas; the <i>bull</i> (the emblem of Śiva), of all beasts of burden and quadrupeds in general; <i>Hira-</i> <i>nyākṣa,</i> of the Daityas (his <i>Yuvarāja</i> being <i>Hiranyakaśipu,</i> comp. page 281<i>b,</i> line 46 ff.); <i>Viprachitti,</i> of the Dānavas and Asuras; it mentions besides that <i>Mahākāla</i> was inaugurated as king of the Kālakeyas; <i>Vrītra,</i> of the sons of Anāyuṣā; <i>Rāhu,</i> of inauspicious meteors; <i>Aruṇa,</i> of the Yogas and Sādhyas; <i>Viratha,</i> as guardian-king of the East; <i>Yama,</i> the son of <i>Āditya,</i> of the South; <i>Amburāja,</i> the son of <i>Kaśyapa,</i> of the West, and <i>Pingala,</i> the one-eyed son of <i>Pulastya,</i> of the North; comp. also <i>Mahābh. Śāntip.</i> v. 4494 ff.] <dvsn n='P'>The type of the inauguration ceremony as practised at the <i>Epic period</i> may probably be recognized in the history of the inauguration of <i>Rāma,</i> as told in the <i>Rāmāyaṇa,</i> and in that of the inauguration of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira,</i> as told in the <i>Mahābhārata.</i> Neither ceremony is described in these poems with the full detail which is given of the vaidik rite in the <i>Aitar. Br.;</i> but the allusion that <i>Rāma</i> was inaugurated by <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> and the other Brāhmaṇas in the same manner as Indra by the Vasus (<i>Yuddhakāṇḍa:</i> वसिष्ठो वा- मदेवश्च &c. …अभ्यषिञ्चन्नरवरं प्रसन्नेन सुगन्धिना । सलि- लेन सहस्राक्षं वसवो वासवं यथा) and the observation which is made in some passages that a certain rite of the inauguration was performed ‘according to the sacred rule’ (<i>Yuddhak.:</i> शास्त्रदृष्टेन विधिना स तदा विधिवद्द्विजः राघ- वस्याभिषेकार्थं स द्विजेभ्यो न्यवेदयत्; <i>Śāntiparv.:</i> जुहाव पा- बकं धीमान्विधिमन्त्रपुरस्कृतम् or पूजयामास तांश्चापि विधि- वद्भूरिदक्षिणः), admit of the conclusion that the ceremony was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the vaidik injunction. This inference is confirmed moreover by another passage of the <i>Śāntīp.</i> (v. 2496) which says ‘that inaugurating a king is a chief duty of the people of a country…for the Veda states: because they chose Indra for their king &c…’ (राष्ट्रस्यैतत्कृत्यतमं राज्ञ एवा- भिषेचनम्…इन्द्रमेव प्रवृणुते यद्राजानमिति श्रुतिः &c.; <i>Arjunam.</i> राष्ट्रस्य = अस्य देशवासिनो लोकस्य). Yet it results from the description given in the Epic poems that the vaidik ceremony had undergone various modifications at the time of their composition.--As the inauguration of <i>Rāma</i> was intended and the necessary preparations for it were made, when his father <i>Daśaratha</i> was still alive, but as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his stepmother <i>Kaikeyī,</i> did not take place then, but fourteen years later, after the death of <i>Daśaratha,</i> an account of the preparatory ceremonies is given in the <i>Ayodhyākāṇda</i> as well as in the <i>Yuddhakāṇḍa</i> of the Rāmāyaṇa, but an account of the complete ceremony in the latter book alone. According to the <i>Ayodhyāk.</i> on the day preceding the intended inauguration <i>Rāma</i> and his wife <i>Sītā</i> held a fast, and in the night they performed this preliminary rite: <i>Rāma,</i> having made his ablutions, approached the idol of Nārāyaṇa, took a cup of clarified butter, as the religious law prescribes (वि- धिवत्), made a libation of it into the kindled fire and drank the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity, he lay, silent and composed, together with <i>Sītā,</i> on a bed of Kuśagrass, which was spread before the altar of Viṣṇu, until the last watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At day-break, reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he performed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In the mean time the town Ayodhyā had assumed a festive appearance and the inauguration implements had been arranged: a beautiful golden throne-seat (भद्रासन or सिं- हासन, also called in other passages भद्रपीठ; the vaidik term is आसन्दी) covered with a tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna as well as from other sacred rivers in all directions and from all oceans, golden jars filled with shoots of the <i>Udumbara</i> tree and various lotus flowers (पद्मोत्पल), <i>Ruchakas</i> (citrons?) and <i>Rochanas</i> (pomegranates?), clarified butter, honey, milk, curd, as well as soil, water and other propitious objects taken from places of pilgrimage (तीर्थ), a white pearl sceptre, a <i>chowri</i> (चामर), a fan, and a white parasol decorated with beautiful garlands; besides, a white bull, a white horse and a splendid, furious elephant (मत्तो गजवरः), also eight beautiful damsels in fine attire, all kinds of musical instruments and bards in festive dress. [This is the account according to the text of the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> in Mr. <i>Gor-</i> <i>resio'</i>s edition; the edition of <i>Schlegel,</i> mentions (2. 15. 4-12) the following implements and in the following order: golden waterjars, an ornamented throne-seat, a chariot covered with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred rivers, tanks, wells, lakes and from all oceans, honey, curd, clarified butter, fried grain (लाजाः), Kuśa grass, flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels and a splendid, furious elephant; golden and silver jars, filled with water, covered with <i>Udumbara</i> branches (क्षीरिभिश्छन्नाः) and various lotus flowers; besides a white, jewelled <i>chowrie</i> (बालव्यजन), a white splendid parasol, a white bull, a white horse, all manners of musical instruments and bards. A similar enumeration occurs in the preceding chapter v. 32 ff. of the same edition where the throne-seat is defined as ‘made of <i>Udumbara</i> wood’, the chariot as ‘drawn by four horses’, the bull as ‘accoutred with golden ropes, fullgrown (lit. having its hump) and white’, and the horse as ‘strong and having four large teeth’; there are mentioned also <i>two</i> white <i>chowries,</i> instead of one, and all kinds of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a scimitar (निस्त्रिंश), a bow, a litter (वाहनं नरसंयुक्तम्; comm. = शिविकादि), a golden vase (भृङ्गारं हिरण्मयम्) and a blazing fire, and amongst the living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards, gaudy courtezans, and besides the eight damsels: ‘professors of divinity (आचार्याः), Brāhmaṇas, cows and pure kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town-and country-people and the citizens with their train’.--The whole passage however (2. 14. 32-39.) seems to be an interpolation in the speech of <i>Vasiṣṭha,</i> at variance with the hurry of his message to the king and made superfluous by the narrative of the following chapter.] The <i>Yuddha-</i> <i>kāṇḍa</i> mentions of implements only a jewelled throne-seat (रत्नमयं पीठम्) and four golden jars ornamented with jewels in which four monkey chiefs, the allies of <i>Rāma</i> in his war against <i>Rāvaṇa,</i> carried water from the ocean of the four regions; <i>Ṛṣabha</i> carried it from the southern ocean, his jar being filled with red sandal branches, <i>Jāmbavat</i> from the western ocean, his jar being ornamented with aloe shoots; <i>Vegadarśin</i> from the northern ocean, his jar being decorated with large branches (of what tree, is not said), and <i>Suṣeṇa</i> from the eastern ocean, his jar being ornamented with bracelets (? अङ्गदकेयूरैः).--Of the ceremony itself it is said that it was performed in the fashion of Indra's inauguration, but a first difference which, to judge from the scanty detail of the text, appears to exist between the manner in which the ceremony was conducted at the epic and that in which it is conducted in the vaidik period, is that the wife of Rāma shares in a portion of the ceremonies and in a seat on the throne with her husband, while a participation of the wife of the king in the ceremony is not mentioned in the <i>Aitar. Br.;</i> and a second and still more important difference results from the circumstance that not merely <i>Vasiṣṭha,</i> the officiating priest, sprinkled Rāma with the consecrated liquid, but after him ‘<i>Vāmadeva, Jā-</i> <i>bāli, Vijaya, Kāśyapa, Gotama, Kātyāyana, Viśvāmitra</i> and other eminent Brāhmaṇas; moreover, after them, in succession, the assistant priests, the damsels, the military chiefs and the citizens, the gods shedding over him from the sky the essence of all plants’; for although the Vasus and other gods sprinkled Indra with the liquid, to inaugurate him as king of the several heavenly quarters, no mention is made in the vaidik ceremony, as applied to a mortal king, that any one else but the officiating priest inaugurated the king with the sacred liquid, or that the active share of the assembly in the ceremony goes beyond their eulogizing the good qualities of the king. A comparison, besides, between the implements of inauguration at the two periods and between the ingredients which constitute the consecration-liquid of the vaidik and that of the epic ceremony, show that the typical quality of the former had, in a great measure, been lost sight of at the period of the epic poems.--The same and other deviations are apparent in the account which is given in the <i>Śāntiparvan</i> of the <i>Mahābhārata,</i> of <i>Yudhisṭhira'</i>s inauguration: ‘Free from anger and pain the royal son of <i>Kuntī</i> sat down joyfully on the golden throne-seat (परमासन), his face turned towards the east; in front of him took their seat on a beautiful golden stool (पीठ) the valiant <i>Sātyaki</i> and <i>Vāsudeva;</i> at either side of him, on fine-shaped jewelled stools the noble <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Arjuna;</i> on a sumptuous ivory throne-seat embellished with gold (but acc. to a comm. ‘on a sumptuous <i>solid</i> throne-seat’; दान्ते सिंहासने, <i>Arju-</i> <i>nam.:</i> दान्ते संहर्षक्षमे), <i>Prithā</i> with <i>Sahadeva</i> and <i>Nakula,</i> and on seats as brilliant as fire separately <i>Sudharman</i> (the priest of Duryodhana) <i>Vidura, Dhaumya</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra,</i> as well as the pugnacious <i>Sanjaya</i> and the illustrious <i>Gāndhārī,</i> all entering from the side whence came <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra.</i> But the righteous king having taken his seat, touched with his fingers white flowers, auspicious emblems (स्वस्तिकान्), fried grain (अक्षतान्), the soil, gold, silver and a pearl; when all his subjects, headed by the house priest, became aware that he had thus possessed himself in an auspicious manner of earth, gold and the various kinds of jewels. The implements of the inauguration prepared and ready, were: filled jars made of gold, <i>Udumbara</i> wood, silver and clay, flowers, fried grain (लाजाः), sacrificial grass (बर्हिस्), cow's milk, fuel of <i>Śami</i> (Acacia suma)-, <i>Aśvattha</i> (Ficus religiosa)-, and <i>Palāśa</i> (Butea frondosa)wood, honey and clarified butter, a ladle (श्रुव) made of <i>Udumbara</i>-wood, and a conch (शङ्ख) ornamented with gold. Then, in obedience to the orders of <i>Kṛṣṇa, Dhaumya,</i> the family priest, marked the sacrificial ground with a line in the direction of north-east (प्रागुदक्प्लवने वेदीं लक्षणेनोपलिख्य च), requested the noble king and the dark daughter of <i>Drupada</i> to be seated on the white, solid-legged throne-seat (सर्वतोभद्र आसने; comp. भद्रासन, भद्रपीठ) which was brilliant like fire and covered over with a tiger-skin, and made a libation into fire while reciting the appropriate mantras (जुहाव पावकं धीमान्विधिमन्त्रपुरस्कृतम्). Upon this <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> took his venerated conch and sprinkled (with its contents) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira,</i> the son of Kuntī, (inaugurating him thus) as lord of the earth, and after him <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra,</i> the royal Ṛṣi (sprinkled the king) and then all his subjects’.--The present made at this occasion by <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> consisted of a thousand Nishkas he gave to the Brāhmaṇas (somewhat in conformity with the injunction of the <i>Aitar. Br.</i>); but the liberality of <i>Rāma</i> was more remarkable: he gave the Brāhmaṇas a million milch cows, ten thousand bulls and three hundred millions Nishkas, besides carts, ornaments, cloths, beds and seats, and numerous villages; he made liberal presents, too, to the monkey chiefs and the monkeys, his allies.--It is, worthy of note, that a custom is met with, in the epic poems, the origin of which cannot with certainty be traced to the injunctions of the <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,</i> viz. a king's having a son or relative of his inaugurated as युवराज (also युवराजन्) or ‘junior king’. For, although <i>Sāyaṇa'</i>s commentary speaks of ‘a father, brother &c.’ who eulogize the king before the priest sprinkles him with the sacred liquid, and although the presence of the father at the ceremony <i>might</i> countenance the inference that the vaidik text implies also the inauguration of a <i>Yuvarāja,</i> it must be observed that the text of the Brāhmaṇa does not contain the quoted words but in their stead the term राजकर्तारः ‘king-makers’, which may or may not comprise the paternal relationship. On the other hand it must be admitted that the vaidik injunction is not at variance with this ceremony, which, once performed, seems to hold good for the inauguration of the prince at his accession to the throne, after the father's death, since no mention is made, in the epic poems, of a repetition of the ceremony. The object of the inauguration of a prince as <i>Yuvarāja</i> is to secure to him the right of succession, and, besides, the advantages supposed to arise from the religious ceremony, as mentioned before, a share in the government, or perhaps all the privileges of a reigning king. For when <i>Daśaratha</i> intends to make his son <i>Rāma</i> a <i>Yuvarāja,</i> he addresses him with these words (in the <i>Āyodhyākāṇḍa</i>): ‘Rāma, I am old; I have lived long and enjoyed every pleasure I desired; hundreds of sacrifices I have performed when I distributed food and liberal presents; thou wast born the son of my desire, for no one is equal to thee on earth; thus I have paid my debt to the gods, the Ṛṣis, my deceased ancestors, the Brāhmaṇas and my own self; nothing remains for me to be done save inaugurating thee; therefore what I am about to tell thee, thou must do. To day all my subjects want thee for their king; therefore, my son, I shall inaugurate thee as junior king’; and <i>Rāma</i> reports to his mother: ‘mother, I am ordered by my father to undertake the government of the country; to-morrow my inauguration will take place, for such is the behest of my father’. Another instance of the installation as <i>Yuvarāja</i> is that of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (<i>Ādip.</i> v. 5517), or of <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena</i> by his brother <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (<i>Śāntip.</i> v. 1475); one of a simultaneous inauguration of a king and of his son, is that of <i>Dyumatsena</i> as king and of his son as <i>Yuvarāja;</i> (<i>Vanap.:</i> ततोऽभिषिषिचुः प्रीत्या द्युमत्सेनं पुरोहिताः । पुत्रं चास्य महात्मानं यौवराज्येऽभिषेचयन्). <dvsn n='P'>The inauguration ceremony at the <i>Paurāṇic</i> period has but little affinity with the vaidik rite; it is a series of proceedings which are founded on late superstitions and reflect scarcely any of the ideas which are the groundwork of the ceremony of the <i>Aitar. Br.</i> A description--though a loose and desultory one--of the <i>Paurāṇic Abhisheka</i> occurs in the 209<sup>th</sup> chapter of the <i>Agni-Purāṇa.</i> It commences with the injunction that a king should before his inauguration choose his astrologer (सांवत्सर), his family-priest (पुरोहित), his officiating-priest (ऋत्विज्), his ministers (मन्त्रिन्) and his queen (महिषी). [Comp. <i>Manu</i> 7. 77 &c.] The astrologer fixes the proper time for the inauguration (comp. page 284<i>b,</i> line 51 ff.); the king takes a bath prepared with Sesamum and white mustard seeds (तिलैः सिद्धार्थकैः स्नानम्); the astrologer and the family-priest hail the king with the cry of ‘victory’, and he being seated on a throneseat (भद्रासन) makes a proclamation of peace or public safety and grants freedom to his prisoners. Then before his inauguration by the family-priest takes place, he addresses a propitiatory prayer to Indra, and fasting on the day of the inauguration makes libations to the Manus &c. (?) and pays respect to a sacrificial jar which is placed on the right or southern side of the sacrificial fire, with perfumes and flowers. [The text of this passage in the two Mss. of the <i>Agni-P.</i> at London, that alone contain a description of the ceremony and could be consulted by me, is very corrupt; the Ms. of the Royal As. Soc. in Devan. char. reads: पुरोधसाभिषेकस्तु कार्येंद्रीशांतिरिव च । उपवास्याभिषेकाहे वै- द्याग्नू जुहुयान्मनून् । वैष्णवानेंद्रमंत्रास्तु सावित्र्यान्वैश्वदेवतान् । सौम्यान्स्वस्त्ययनं धर्म आयुष्याभयदान्मनून् । अपराजितां च कलशं वह्नेर्दक्षिणपार्श्वगे । शम्या च वंतुं हैमं च पूजयेद्गंधपुष्पकैः; the Ms. of the Royal S. in Bengali char.: पुरोधस्याभिषेक प्राक्कार्येन्द्रीशान्तिरेव च । उपधास्यभिषेकाद्वेत्यग्नौ जुहुयादमून् । वैष्णवमैत्रमन्त्रास्तु सावित्रान्वैश्वदेवतान् । सौम्यावस्वायनं शर्म चर्मायुष्याभयान्मनून् । अपराजितं च कलसं वह्नेर्दक्षिणपार्श्वगं । सदाभरणहैमञ्च पूजयेद्गन्धपुष्पकैः.--This extract may serve at the same time, as a specimen of the indifferent state of both Mss.--that of the R. S. being however the better of the two--which made it necessary to renounce a <i>literal</i> translation of the <i>whole</i> chapter.] The flame of this fire should go rightwards, it should be bright like melted gold, crackle like carts or thunder(?), be clear (or smokeless), scent the air, be like the sign Swastika, have an uninterrupted, large flame and be free from sparks; no cats, wild beasts or birds should pass over the sacrificial ground [Mss.: प्रदक्षिणावर्तशिखस्तु तप्तजाम्बुनदप्रभः । रथौ- घघोषनिर्घोषो (R.

S. ऽर्चितः) । न व्रजेयुश्च मध्येन मार्जारमृगपक्षिणः].The king, to prepare himself for the inauguration, purifies his head with soil taken from the top of a mountain, his ears with soil from the top of an ant-hill (वल्मीकाग्रमृदा), his mouth with soil from a temple of Viṣṇu, his neck with soil from a temple of Indra, his breast with soil from a royal court yard (नृपाजिरात्), his right arm with soil thrown up by the horns of a bull (वृषशृङ्गोद्धृतमृदा), his back with soil from a lake, his belly with soil from the two banks of a river, his hips with soil taken from the door of a brothel (वेश्याद्वारमृदा राज्ञः कटिशौचं विधीयते), his thighs with soil from a sacrificial spot (यज्ञस्थानात्; but Ms. R. A. S. from a cowpen: गोस्थानात्, which word however occurs immediately again), his knees with soil from a cowpen, his legs with soil from a horse-stable, his feet with soil from a cart-wheel; and the soil itself he washes off with <i>Pancha-</i> <i>gavya</i> (a compound of five articles derived from the cow: milk, curd, clarified butter, cow's urine and cow-dung). After this purification four ministers sprinkle the king who is seated on the throne: first the Brāhmaṇa minister with clarified butter out of a golden jar which stands east of the throne, then the Kshatriya minister with milk out of a silver jar which stands south, next the Vaiśya minister with curds out of a copper jar which stands west, and lastly the Śūdra minister with water out of an earthen jar which stands north of the throne […भद्रासनगतं नृपम् । अभिषिञ्चेदमात्यानां चतुष्टयमथो घटैः । पूर्वतो हेमकुम्भेन घृत- पूर्णेन ब्राह्मणः । रूप्यकुम्भेन याम्येन क्षीरपूर्णेन क्षत्रियः । दध्ना च ताम्रकुम्भेन वैश्यः पश्चिमगेन च । मृन्मयेन जलेनोदक्शूद्रा- मात्योऽभिषेचयेत्]. After them a Brāhmaṇa versed in the Ṛgveda sprinkles him with honey and one who knows how to chant the Sāmaveda with Kuśagrass-water. Then the family-priest goes to the golden jar (mentioned above page 282<i>b,</i> line 2) and commits the sacrificial fire in the prescribed manner and with the appropriate hymns to the care of the Brāhmaṇas who assist him. [Ms. R. S.: संपी- तवन्तं कलसं तथागत्य पुरोहितः । विधाय वह्निरक्षां तु सद- स्येषु यथाविधि ॥ राजस्त्रियाभिषेके च ये च मन्त्राः प्रकीर्तिताः । तैस्तु दद्यान्महाभागब्राह्मणानां शनैस्तथा; <i>sic.</i>--R.

A. S.: his hip) with water taken from various places of pilgrimage and mixed with Rochanā; the Brāhmaṇas holding before the king, while the music plays, the jar which contains the annuals, together with the <i>chowrie,</i> the fan and the other emblems of royalty. [The greater portion of the passage describing this rite is again so corrupt in both Mss. that the meaning of some words and the exact nature of the verses alluded to by the quotation of their beginning words: या ओषधीः,…पुष्पवती, ब्राह्मण°, आशु शिशानः, ये देवाः &c., is open to doubt; Mss.: ततो पुरोहितो गच्छेद्वेदिमूलं तदैव तु (R.

He then orders a (white?) bull, a white horse (?) and an elephant to be led in, caparisoned severally with a panther- (?), a lion-and a tiger-skin. [Mss.: तं पश्येद्दर्पणं राजा घृतं वै मङ्गलादिकम् । अभ्यर्च्य विष्णुं ब्रह्माणं मन्त्रादींश्चं ग्रशकने (R. A.

He further salutes respectfully the bull, in patting it on the back, also the elephant, which he does not mount; but the horse he mounts, and having rode on it round his city (in keeping his right side towards it), while the royal passage is lined with soldiers, he enters it and dismisses gracefully all the people with marks of his favour. [The Ms. of the R. S. however condenses the latter passage thus: ‘the door-keeper ushers in the ministers, counsellors &c. and he dismisses gracefully all the people with gifts of cows, goats, sheep &c.’; अमात्यसचिवादींश्च प्रतीहारः प्रदर्शयेत् । गोजाविग्रहदानाद्यैः प्रार्च्य सर्वान्विसर्जयेत्; Ms. R.

A. S.: कुम्भान्कुम्भोदकैः-- सिञ्चेत्तेन संर्वं हि सिध्यति). These <i>mantras</i> have nothing in common with those recited at the vaidik ceremony; they contain merely an enumeration of gods, demons, saints, mountains, rivers &c. even of literary works, which are asked to sprinkle the king, to grant him victory and to protect him; the order in which all these beings and objects are paraded, is of the same senseless kind, and the nomenclature of the same tedious description as they not uncomconly occur in those works which exhibit a caricature of the ancient Hindu religion,--in the Purāṇas. It will suffice to give as a specimen the following verses of the forty and some Ślokas which form the subject of this chapter: ‘may the gods sprinkle thee, and Brahman, Viṣṇu, Śiva, Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha; may the ten elephants of the regions give thee victory, and Rudra, Dharma, Daksha, the Sun, religious Belief (श्रद्धा), Bhṛgu, Atri, Vaśiṣṭha &c. &c…; may the sons of Kṛśāśva protect thee, and the wives of Ariṣṭanemin, of Chandra and of Pulastya, Bhūtā (a female goblin), Kapidanṣṭrī …Syeṇī (a female hawk), Bhāśi (a water-fowl), Krauñchī (a curlew), Dhṛtarāṣṭrī (a goose); Śukī (a female parrot; this and the preceding being probably names of female imps);…the Gandharvas Hāhā, Hūhū, Nārada, Viśvāvasu, Tumburu;…the Apsarasas Anavadyā, Sukeśī, Menakā, Sahajanyā, Kratusthalā, Ghṛtāchī, Viśvāchī Puñjikasthalā, Pramlochā, Urvaśī, Rambhā, Pañchachūḍā, Tilottamā, Chitralekhā, Lakṣmaṇā, Puṇḍarīkā and Vāruṇī;…the Ṛ4ṣis Bālakhilyas, Vyāsa, Valmīki &c., the kings Prithu, Dilīpa, Bharata, Dushyanta (written Ms. R.

Āyurveda, Gandharvaveda, and Dhanurveda, the Angas, viz. Śikṣā, Kalpa, Vyākaraṇa, Nirukta, the science of the luminous bodies (ज्योतिषां गतिः) and Chhandas [see s. v. अङ्ग], the Vedas [here mentioned again, like the Angas], the Mīmānsā-and Nyāya-systems (मी- मांसान्यायविस्तरः), and the old Dharmaśāstra (धर्मशास्त्रं पुराणं च); for these are the fourteen sciences [i. e. the four Vedas, the six Angas, the Purāṇas as eleventh, the Mīmānsā, Nyāya and law]; the Sāṅkhya-and Yoga-systems, the system of the Pāsupatas, the Vedānta and the system of the Pāñcharātras (पाशुपतं वेदाश्च--sic--पाञ्चरात्रकम्), for these are the five doctrines; the auspicious verse Gāyatrī (q. v.), the Durgā-science and the science of music[?]; (कृतान्तपञ्चकं ह्येतद्गायत्री च शिवा तथा । दुर्गाविद्या च गा- न्धारी पान्तु त्वां शान्तिदाश्च ते).<dvsn n='P'>Another account of a royal inauguration, which is similar to that of the Agni-Purāṇa and perhaps belongs to a still more recent period than the latter, is that of the <i>Mānasāra,</i> a work on Architecture and reputedly the completest of its kind. [The high antiquity which is ascribed by the Hindus to this work will become more than doubtful, from a comparison, for instance, of this portion of it with the 209<sup>th</sup> ch. of the Agni-P. The only Ms. of this work, I could consult, is hopelessly incorrect and does not permit to make a reliable translation of it; it is a copy of an ancient Ms. in Tamul characters which was discovered at Trichinopoly, is imperfect at the beginning and at the end, was written out under the direction of Mr. Ch. P. Brown and is now in possession of the E. I. H.; its extreme rareness in India as well as in Europe makes it adviseable to draw attention to some particulars of its description of a royal inauguration which may be rendered in a safe manner.] The <i>Mānasāra</i> puts forward two personages in the inauguration ceremony who do not make their appearance in the foregoing accounts: the <i>Sthapati</i> or the architect, and the <i>Sthāpaka</i> or (probably) the master of the ceremonies. According to this work, the throne is placed in a handsome sacrificial building where the inauguration takes place (यागमण्डपे सौम्ये तु सिंहासनस्य चो- परि । नृपालं तत्र संस्थाप्य अभिषेकं समारभेत्; some such building seems to be implied also by the description of the Agni-Purāṇa, since a ‘door-keeper’ is mentioned, but it is not expressedly named); the inauguration liquid, which consists of river and sea-water is consecrated by chanting hymns from the Atharvaveda, Sāmaveda and other sacred works; (सरित्समुद्रसलिलकुम्भैः पूर्णविमाधवैः (<i>sic</i>) । अथर्व- सामगीतैश्च चान्यैश्चागममन्त्रकैः); the king marks his forehead with the sign Tripuṇḍra (q. v.: पश्चात्तु होमनिष्ठां च दर्भं दत्त्वा त्रिपुण्ड्रकम् । ललाटसारणं कुर्याद्भूपतिस्तु यथावि- धि), anoints his body with sandal and saffron, and the <i>Sthapati</i> purifies him with the compound called <i>Pancha-</i> <i>gavya</i> (see above page 282<i>b,</i> line 45); them the family-priest places on his head the tiara, and this toilet being completed, the <i>Sthapati</i> and the <i>Sthāpaka</i> invite the king to take place, with his queen, on the throne when the sacred liquid is sprinkled on his forehead while he bears the jewelled tiara (रत्नसंतुष्टमुकुटमूर्ध्वं राजोपधारयेत्). This ceremony having been performed under ‘benedictions and all manner of auspicious noises’ (सर्वमङ्गलघोषैश्च स्वस्तिवा- चनपूर्ववत्) the king mounts on an elephant and, under the sounds of a similar music, rides round his city, keeping his right side towards it, and distributes gifts amongst the spectators (कुर्यादारोहणं पश्चाद्राजा त्वैरावतोपरि । नगरी- प्रदक्षिणं कुर्यात्सर्वमङ्गलघोषकैः). These gifts which consist in corn and the like, cow's and other milk, weapons, and generally in any thing whether auspicious or not, the king should throw before himself and touch with his own hand, for in doing so he will not merely acquire strength, victory and glory but abundance of food &c. [A modern treatise on the royal inauguration, called <i>Rājyābhiṣekapaddhati,</i>--without either date or name of the author--is very prolix in the enumeration of the mantras; it quotes the <i>Śatapathabr.</i> and, among the Purāṇas, chiefly the <i>Agni-P.;</i> but it is rather an uncritical compilation from various books, than an authoritative source of information.] <dvsn n='P'>The <i>time of the inauguration</i> must be an auspicious one. <i>Rāma</i> was inaugurated when the moon entered the asterism <i>Pushya,</i> in the hour <i>Abhijit;</i> (<i>Yuddhak.:</i> ततः प्रभाते विमले मुहूर्तेऽभिजिति प्रभुः । वसिष्ठः पुष्ययोगेन ब्राह्मणैः परिवा- रितः । रामं रत्नमये पीठे…उपवेश्य &c.).--The <i>Agni-P.</i> merely forbids the inauguration to take place at night time, but makes no further restriction (सांवत्सरो नृपं काले ससंभारोऽभिषेचनम् । कुर्यादृते रात्रिकालं कालस्य नियमः स्मृतः).--According to the astrological work <i>Jyotishara-</i> <i>tnamālā,</i> the inauguration of a king may take place when the moon enters either of the following asterisms: <i>Anu-</i> <i>rādhā</i> (17<sup>th</sup> ), <i>Hasta</i> (13<sup>th</sup> ), <i>Pushya</i> (8<sup>th</sup> ), <i>Rohiṇi</i> (4<sup>th</sup> ), <i>Śra-</i> <i>vaṇa</i> (23<sup>d</sup> ) and the three next to it (viz. <i>Dhaniṣṭhā, Śata-</i> <i>bhiṣā, Pūrvabhādrapadā</i>), <i>Revatī</i> (28<sup>th</sup> ), <i>Mṛgaśiras</i> (5<sup>th</sup> ) or <i>Aśvinī</i> (1<sup>st</sup> ); (मैत्रशाक्रकरपुष्यरोहिणीवैष्णवेषु तिसृषूत्तरासु च । रेवतीमृगशिरोऽश्विनीष्वपि क्ष्माभुजां समभिषेक इष्यते).Another astrological work, the <i>Muhūrtachintāmaṇī,</i> lays down the following rules: ‘the inauguration of a king is auspicious, if it takes place at the period of the sun's progress to the north of the equator, when Jupiter, the Moon and Venus have risen or those powerful planets: Mars, the Sun, the predominant or the minor planet which rule the (king's) nativity; but <i>not</i> on the fourth, ninth or fourteenth day of the month Chaitra, on a Tuesday, during the night or in an intercalary month. If it is performed at the conjunction of ill-omened planets with the first asterism (reckoned from that under which the king is born) their influence brings him illness; with the eighth, death; with the fifth, affliction of his sons; with the twelfth, poverty; with the tenth, it deprives him of energy; with the seventh or fourth, it destroys his sovereign power. All is auspicious, however, if an auspicious planet enters into the circle. If Jupiter enters into conjunction with the ninth or fifth asterism (reckoned from that under which the king is born) or Mars with the sixth, or Venus with the tenth, the king will always enjoy royal happiness; if Saturn enters into conjunction with the third, the Sun with the eleventh or Jupiter with the tenth or fourth asterism (and the inauguration then takes place), his empire will remain firm’; [राजाभिषेकः शुभ उत्तरायणे गुर्विन्दुशुक्रैरुदितैर्बला- न्वितैः । भौमार्कलग्नेशदशेशजन्मपैर्नो चैत्ररिक्तारनिशामलिम्लु- चैः ॥ ९ ॥ पापैस्तनौ रुग्निधने मृतिः सुते पुत्रार्त्तिरर्थव्ययगैर्द- रिद्रता । स्यात्खेऽलसो भ्रष्टपदो द्युनाम्बुगैः सर्वं शुभं केन्द्रगतैः शुभग्रहैः ॥ २ ॥ गुरुर्लग्नकोणे कुजोऽरौ सितः खे स राजा मोदते राजलक्ष्म्या । तृतीयायगौ सौरिसूर्यौ खबम्ध्वोर्गुरुश्चेद्ध- रित्री स्थिरा स्यान्नृपस्य ॥ ३ ॥ इति राजाभिषेकप्रकरणम् ॥; the technical terms are rendered, in the given translation, according to the comment of the author, <i>Daivajnarāma</i>]. <dvsn n='P'><i>B.</i> INAUGURATION OF A MILITARY COMMANDER. This ceremony, the object of which is to ensure to the chief of an army victory over his enemies, does not appear to have been performed before the period of the <i>Mahābhārata,</i> where the inauguration of <i>Kārtikeya</i> as commander of the divine hosts is mentioned as the type of such a rite; comp. e. g. the words addressed by <i>Duryodhana</i> to <i>Śalya,</i> the king of Madra, when he chose him for his military chief: सैना- पत्येन वरये त्वामहं मातुलातुलम् । सोऽस्मान्पाहि युधां श्रेष्ठ स्कन्दो देवानिहाहवे । अभिषिच्यस्व राजेन्द्र देवानामिव पा- वकिः । जहि शत्रून्रणे वीर महेन्द्रो दानवानिव.--The proceedings at such an inauguration are not fully detailed in the description given in the <i>Śalyaparvan</i> of the <i>Mahābh.</i> (ch. 46), of the inauguration of <i>Kārtikeya;</i> but from the rites which are mentioned, it may be inferred, that they were substantially the same as those which took place at the inauguration of a king; (comp. e. g.: ततोऽभिषेक- संभारान्सर्वान्संभृत्य शास्त्रतः । वृहस्पतिः समिद्धेऽग्नौ जुहावाग्निं यथाविधि । ततो हिमवता दत्ते मणिप्रबरशोभिते । दिव्यर- त्नाचिते पुण्ये निषण्णं परमासने । सर्वमङ्गलसंभारैर्विधिमन्त्रपुर- स्कृतम् । आभिषेचनिकं द्रव्यं गृहीत्वा देवतागणाः &c. …। बहुलत्वाच्च नोक्ता ये विविधा देवतागणाः । ते कुमाराभिषे- कार्थं समाजग्मुस्ततस्ततः । जगृहुस्ते तदा राजन्सर्व एव दिवौ- कसः । आभिषेचनिकं भाण्डं मङ्गलानि च सर्वशः । दिव्यसंभा- रसंयुक्तैः कलसैः काञ्चनैर्नृप । सरस्वतीभिः पुण्याभिर्दिव्यतोया- भिरेव तु । अभ्यषिञ्चन्कुमारं वै संप्रहृष्टा दिवौकसः । सेनापतिं महात्मानमसुराणां भयंकरम् । पुरा यथा महाराज वरुणं वै जलेश्वरम् । तथाभ्यषिञ्चद्भगवान्ब्रह्मा लोकपितामहः &c.); the text (as results from the last quotation) professes at least that they are analogous to those at the inauguration of <i>Varuṇa</i> as king of the waters, and at the latter ceremony (mentioned <i>Śalyap.</i> chap. 48) reference is made to the inauguration of <i>Indra,</i> which is the type of a royal inauguration; (वरुणं देवताः सर्वाः समेत्येदमथाब्रुवन् । यथास्मा- न्सुरराट्शक्रो भयेभ्यः पाति सर्वदा । तथा त्वमपि सर्वासां सरितां वै पतिर्भव ।…अभिषिक्तस्ततो देवैर्वरुणोऽपि महायशाः । सरितः सागरांश्चैव नदांश्चापि सरांसि च । पाल- यामास विधिना यथा देवाञ्छतक्रतुः ।). There seems to have been that difference, however, that the military commander, his installation having been performed, did not give but receive presents, for the <i>Mahābh.</i> exhibits a long list of presents that were offered to <i>Kārtikeya</i> by the gods who assisted at his consecration.--The time deemed auspicious or inauspicious is the same for the inauguration of a military chief as for that of a king, except that <i>Tuesday</i> is considered also amongst the lucky days of the former, Mars being himself a military chief; (according to <i>Daiva-</i> <i>jnarāma</i> in his comm. on the quoted first verse of the <i>Muhūrtachintāmaṇi:</i> कुत्रचिद्भौमवारोऽप्युक्तः । स सेनापत्य- भिषेकपरो ज्ञेयः । भौमस्य सेनापतित्वात्). <dvsn n='P'>2.

Washing the image of a divinity, purifying it with ablutions. This ceremony takes place either at a festival held in honour of a divinity or at the installation of an idol as a domestic and tutelary divinity; it consists in rubbing it over with ointments and washing it with liquids prepared of different substances under the recital of appropriate mantras. (According to the given quotation from the <i>Agni-Pur.,</i> the invocations mentioned in the latter, are the same for the consecration of an idol as for that of a king.) At the <i>Dola</i> festival held in honour of the juvenile <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> the following materiels are used, according to the <i>Utkalakhaṇḍa</i> (as quoted by <i>Rādhākāntadeva</i>): cold water, cow-dung, cow's urine, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter (i. e. the five substances of the Panchagavya), infusions of Kuśa-grass (कुशोदकम्), of Śaṅkha (a perfume, apparently a dried shell-fish; शङ्खोदकम्), of sandal (चन्दनोदकम्), of saffron (कुङ्कुमोदकम्), of fruits and flowers (फलोद- कम् and पुष्पोदकम्), an unguent prepared of the powder of sandal wood and of emblic myrobalan (चन्दनपिष्टाम- लक्युद्वर्तनम्); scented water (सुगन्धिजलम्) with which the idol is washed eight times, milk, clarified butter and honey being added severally at the second, seventh and eighth ablution; an infusion of perfumes (गन्धोदकम्) with which five ablutions are made; water taken from places of pilgrimage (तीर्थजलम्), Ganges-water, water proceeding from an ant-hill, infusion of small annuals (सर्वौषधिजलम्), Sahasradhārā-water (सहस्रधाराजलम्), various kinds of water in jars (according to some, in 108 jars).--At the <i>Durgā</i> festival, according to the <i>Vṛhannandikeśvara-Purāṇa</i> (also quoted by <i>Rādhāk.</i>) the image of the goddess is rubbed over before a looking glass (दर्पणप्रतिबिम्बे) with an ointment prepared of turmeric and powder of emblic myrobalan and then washed with the following things one after the other, under the recital of mantras, with: pure water, an infusion of Śaṅkha, Ganges-water, an infusion of perfumes, each article of the Panchagavya (successively, as mentioned before), an infusion of Kuśa-grass, Pañchāmṛta (a mixture of milk, curds, sugar, clarified butter and honey), ice-water, honey, an infusion of flowers, sea-water mixed with the juice of the sugar-cane (इक्षुरससागरोदके), an infusion of small and large annuals mixed together (सर्वौ- षधिमहौषधिजलम्), water containing five kinds of extracts (पञ्चकषायोदकम्), eight sorts of earth (अष्टमृत्तिकाः? probably अष्टौ मृ°), infusion of fruits, hot water, Sahasradhārā-water, various kinds of water in eight jars, viz. atmospheric water in one jar (व्योमगङ्गाम्बुपूर्णाद्यकलसः), cloud-water in a second (मेघतोयपूर्ण°), water of the Sarasvatī in a third (सारस्वततोयपूर्ण°), sea-water in a fourth (सागरोदकपूर्ण°), water mixed with lotus-pollen (पद्मरेणु- मिश्रितजलपूर्ण°) in a fifth, cascade-water in a sixth (निर्ज्झ- रोदकपूर्ण°), water from various places of pilgrimage in a seventh (सर्वतीर्थाम्बुपूर्ण°) and pure water in an eighth jar शुद्धजलपूर्णाष्टमकलसः). Besides these substances, other ritual works mention: river-water, infusions of cocoa-nuts and of (pounded) pearls, rain-water, infusions of camphor and of sandal, aloe, gold, silver, <i>Gorochanā,</i> saffron, <i>Śrīphala,</i> corn, Dūb-grass, sugar, lake-water, Ganges-and sea-water mixed together, an infusion of five kinds of grain (पञ्च- शस्यजलम्), of sesamum, tank-, lotus-pond-, and wellwater, infusions of fruits and roots, Arghya (q. v.) -water, other kinds of water in four jars, and cold water; sesamumoil and fragrant-oil; earth from river-banks, earth stirred up by the teeth of a boar (वराहदन्तमृत्तिका), earth from the door of a brothel (वेश्याद्वारमृत्तिका), from the gate of a palace (राजद्वारमृत्तिका), earth stirred up by the horns of a bull, earth from an ant-hill, from a quadrivium, from the near and opposite banks of a stream (पारावारमृत्तिका), from the door of a temple and from the Ganges; and according to some, earth stirred up by the teeth of an elephant, earth from a river, from its two banks, from a town-gate (नागरमृत्तिका), from a cowpen and a trivium; others name infusions of the five articles of Pañchāmṛta severally, of the small and the large annuals severally (सवौषधि- महौषधी पृथक्), of the five kinds of extracts severally, or infusions only of two articles of the Pañchāmṛta (viz. honey, butter and milk excepted); again some name an ointment made of turmeric only, some one prepared of sesamum-oil and turmeric, and others add an aromatic powder and one made of five kinds of grain. In the ritual works founded on the <i>Kālī-</i> and <i>Devī-Purāṇas</i> there are mentioned, besides, infusions of (pounded) corals, emeralds, rubies, pearls, lapis lazuli, several varieties of lotusses (पद्म, कह्लार, कुमुद), of sugar-cane, lac (अलक्तक), red sandal, turmeric, flour, rice and white mustard, as well as poolwater and water from various places of pilgrimage; earth from five such places; oil made of the Viṣṇu plant, an ointment made of emblic myrobalan together with sesamumoil and turmeric.--The ritual works founded on the <i>Purāṇas</i> mention moreover eight melodies which are severally played when the idol is washed with the eight kinds of water in the eight jars (see above col. <i>a,</i> line 43), as well as the instruments with which they are played. At the washing with the atmospheric water the melody is (acc. to the ritual of the <i>Vṛhannandikeśvara-Pur.</i>) <i>Mālasī,</i> played with the instrument <i>Mangalotsava,</i> or (acc. to the ritual of the <i>Devī-Pur.</i>) <i>Vārāḍī,</i> played with the instrument <i>Indra-</i> <i>vijaya,</i> or (acc. to the ritual of the <i>Kālī-Pur.</i>) <i>Mālava,</i> played with the instrument <i>Vijaya;</i> at the washing with the cloud-water, the m. is <i>Devakīrī,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Bhu-</i> <i>vanavijaya (Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Mālavagauḍa,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Mangalavijaya (D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Lalitā,</i> played with the large kettle drum <i>Dundubhī (K.-Pur.);</i> at the washing with the water of the Sarasvatī, the m. is <i>Vārāḍī,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Vijaya (Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Mālava,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Devotsava</i> <i>(D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Vibhāṣā,</i> p. w. the drum <i>Dundubhi (K.-Pur.);</i> at the washing with the sea-water, the m. is <i>Deśāla,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Rājābhiṣeka (Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Deśāla,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Ghanatāla (D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Bhairavī,</i> p. w. the flute <i>Vanśī (K.-Pur.);</i> at the washing with the lotus pollen-water, the m. is <i>Dhānuṣī,</i> p. the instr. <i>Madhurī (Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Mālavī,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Madhukara (D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Koḍā,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Indrābhiṣeka (K.-Pur.);</i> at the washing with the cascade-water, the m. is <i>Bhairavī,</i> p. w. the cymbal <i>Karatāla (Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Bhairavī;</i> p. w. the double drum <i>Ḍhakkā (D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Vārāḍī,</i> p. w. the conch <i>Śaṅkha</i> <i>(K.-P.);</i> at the washing with the Tīrtha-water, the m. is <i>Gujjarī,</i> p. w. the flute <i>Vanśī (Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Vasanta,</i> p. w. the conch <i>Śaṅkha (D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Vasanta,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Pañchaśabda (K.-Pur.);</i> at the washing with the pure water the melody is <i>Vasanta,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Pañchaśabda</i> <i>(Vṛh.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Koḍā,</i> p. w. the drum <i>Mṛdaṅga (D.-Pur.),</i> or <i>Dhānuṣī,</i> p. w. the instr. <i>Vijaya (K.-Pur.).</i> See <i>Rādhāk.</i> s. v. अभिषेक.--At the installation of a domestic idol (देवप्रतिष्ठा) the following articles are recommended for the ablution by the <i>Devapratiṣṭhatattva</i> (as quoted by <i>Rādhāk.</i>): river-, torrent-, sea-, cascade- and cloud-water, a mixture of milk, curds, sugar, clarified butter and honey, <i>Panchagavya</i> mixed with an infusion of Kuśa-grass; earth stirred up by the hoofs of a horse and the teeth of an elephant, earth from a mountain, from Kuśa-grass and an ant-hill, sesamum-oil, clarified butter, an infusion of five extracts (पञ्चकषायोदकम्), flowers of the mango-tree, of the <i>Champaka</i> (Michelia champaca), of the Acacia suma, lotusses and Oleander; leaves of holy basil, jasmin and <i>Śṛphala</i> (Ægle marmelos.), a cleansing powder prepared either of the refuse of Sesamum (तिलकल्क), or of rice (शालितण्डुल), or of <i>Vilwa</i> (Ægle marmelos.) -leaves, or of emblic myrobalan (आमलक); hot water, water from places of pilgrimage.
