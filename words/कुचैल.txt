She begged some <i>Pṛthukataṇ-</i> <i>ḍula,</i> and sent it as present to Kṛṣṇa. When he came to Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa recognised him and entertained him. Rukmiṇī also honoured him. Kṛṣṇa recalled their school days, and their loyalty to Guru Sāndīpani, and how he reciprocated it. Once when they went out and were caught in storm and rains, the Guru came in search of them with great anxiety. Kucaila gave Kṛṣṇa the <i>Pṛthukataṇḍula</i> which Kṛṣṇa shared with Rukminī and heartily ate of it. After spending a jolly night, the Brāhmaṇa took leave of his friend and went home, ruminating on the way why Kṛṣṇa did not offer any riches to him. When he neared his place, he found tall mansions lavishly built and furnished. His wife extended him welcome with servants. He knew it was all the work of his friend Kṛṣṇa. Spent a righteous life ever meditating on Hari's lotus feet. <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. X. 80. 6-45; 81 (whole)."
