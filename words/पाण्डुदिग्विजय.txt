After thirty days <i>Pāṇḍu</i> started on his conquest of the world, and conquered the <i>Daśārṇas</i> (<i>āgaskṛtaḥ</i>), slew the <i>Magadha</i> king <i>Dīrgha</i> (who had offended against numerous kings) in <i>Rājagṛha</i>; then going into <i>Mithilā</i> he defeated the <i>Videhas</i>; then the <i>Kāśis, Suhmas</i>, and <i>Puṇḍras</i>, etc., and after having made all kings the vassals of the <i>Kurus</i>, he returned laden with much wealth to <i>Hāstinapura</i>, where people said: “They who before robbed the <i>Kurus</i> of both territory and wealth, have been made to pay tribute” by <i>Pāṇḍu</i> (I, <b>113</b>)."
