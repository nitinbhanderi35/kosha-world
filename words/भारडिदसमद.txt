The name of the place where the liṅga containing the inscription was found is said to be Bhārādhī Ḍīh,<sup>396</sup> Bhāraḍī of our inscription may also be compared with ‘bharaḍiya’ of the Sāñcī stūpa inscription.<sup>397</sup> Samada is possibly Samudra, an epithet for Siva. D.C. Sircar takes ‘Samudra’ to be the ‘nām-aika-deśa of a deity called Samuderśvara’ and suggests that the relevant passage is to be corrected as <i>‘pārago bharaḍida-samudreśvara’.<sup>398</sup></i> The meaning of the passage is difficult to explain."
