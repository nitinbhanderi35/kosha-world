            "content": "SACRAMENT¦, <i>s.</i> संस्कारः, महायज्ञः. For the twelve sanskāras or sacred symbolical rites, <i>see</i> RITE. The following are the five mahā-yajnas, or great sacraments of the Hindūs (as explained in Manu III. 70. <i>et. seq.</i>), appointed to be performed every day by the Grihastha, or house-keeper, for the sake of expiating the sin incurred by the involuntary destruction of minute living creatures. They refer respectively to what is due to five objects, viz. himself, the gods, his fore-fathers, spirits or ghosts, and men or guests. 1. Study of Scripture, with prayer and meditation, called ब्रह्मयज्ञः or अहुतः. 2. Offering oblations to the gods in fire, called देवयज्ञः or हुतः. 3. Offering libations of water and cakes to the manes of deceased ancestors, called पितृयज्ञः or प्राशितं or श्राद्धं. 4. Casting the residue of oblations on the ground or in water, as an offering to spirits or goblins, called भूतयज्ञः or बलियज्ञः or प्रहुतः or आहुतः or बलिः <i>m.</i> 5. Receiving guests, and especially Brahmans, with hospitality, called नृयज्ञः or मनुप्पयज्ञः or ब्राह्म्यहुतं or ब्राह्म्यं or ब्रह्महुतं. The Viṣnu-Purāna adds two other sacraments, viz. ‘propagation of offspring,’ प्रजापतियज्ञः, and ‘observance of truth,’ सत्ययज्ञः, but these are comparatively modern additions. The Christian idea of a sacrament may be expressed by संस्कारः or ख्रीष्टप्रकल्पितसंस्कारः; as, ‘the sacrament of baptism,’ जलसंस्कारः or जलसेचनसंस्कारः or मज्जनसंस्कारः; ‘of the Lord's Supper,’ ख्रीष्टभोजनसंस्कारः or ख्रीष्टमृन्युरमरणार्थकसंस्कारः."
