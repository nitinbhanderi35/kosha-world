Perhaps the same<sup>3</sup> Purumīḷha is intended in an obscure hymn in the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> where, according to the legends reported in the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>5</sup> and by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in his commentary on the Sarvānukramaṇī,<sup>6</sup> and by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> he as well as <b>Taranta</b> was a son of Vidadaśva, and a patron of the singer <b>Śyāvāśva.</b> The correctness of the legend has been shown to be most improbable by Oldenberg,<sup>7</sup> who points out<sup>8</sup> that the legend misinterprets the Rigveda by making Purumīḷha a Vaidadaśvi, for he is there only compared in generosity to one. <dvsn n='P'/>In another legend found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and based on a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> Purumīḷha and Taranta appear as persons who received gifts from <b>Dhvasra</b> and <b>Puru-</b> <b>ṣanti,</b> and as sons of Vidadaśva. The legend, which also occurs in the Śāṭyāyanaka,<sup>11</sup> is apparently best explained by Sieg,<sup>12</sup> who says that as the two were kings they could not under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they became singers.
