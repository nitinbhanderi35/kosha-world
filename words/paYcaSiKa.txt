He was brought up breastfed by Kapilā, wife of Āsuri and so he was known as Kāpila also. He dwelt in Pañcasrotas and performed a Yāga for a thousand years and got his name Pañcaśikha. He went to the assembly of the learned king Janaka and entered into a polemic contest with him and defeated him. The defeated King gave Pañcaśikha great respect and he lived in the court of Janaka as his Guru for a number of years. (Chapter 218, Śānti Parva)."
