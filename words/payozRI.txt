(Chapter 61, Vana Parva). Those who bathe in this river will get the benefit of doing a thousand godānas (gifts of cows). There is a sacred place on the shores of this river called Varāhatīrtha. King Nṛga performed a Yāga at this place at which Indra came and had Somapāna and the brahmins received dakṣiṇā (fees) and got drunk. (Chapters 88 and 121, Vana Parva). Even the mere contact of water-drops of Payoṣṇī river would absolve one of all sins. The musical instrument Śṛṅga of Śiva is in this river. Dharmaputra once came to this river and stayed there for some time drinking its water. (Chapter 120, Vana Parva). On another occasion Gaya son of King Amūrtarayas conducted seven aśvamedhas at this place and pleased Indra. (Chapter 21, Anuśāsana Parva)."
