Over and above prose and verse the Campūs use daṇḍakas (very long, involved and poetical prose). This literary form had its origin first in Sanskrit and other Indian languages adopted it with some variations. For instance, though prose in Sanskrit Campūs is really prose, that in Malayalam is something akin to metrical prose. There are more than two hundred Campūs in Malayalam. The most famous of the Campū writers in Malayālam are Punam Namboothiri, Mahāmaṅgalam Namboothiri and Nīlakaṇṭha."
