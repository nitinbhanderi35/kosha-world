So he came in the guise of a bird and requested for human flesh. Then the hermit called his sons and asked them to give their flesh to the bird. They were not prepared to do so. Sukṛṣa got angry and cursed his sons that they would be born as birds. Accordingly the sons of the hermit took birth in the Garuḍa family under the names Droṇaputra, Piṅgākṣa, Vibodha, Suputra and Sumukha. As a remission of the curse, the hermit said that even as birds they would be having wisdom and knowledge. <dvsn n='NI'/>After this, to keep his word, Sukṛṣa got ready to cut his own flesh for the bird. Then Indra appeared in his own form and blessed the hermit."
