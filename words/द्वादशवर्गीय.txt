No such group has been discovered in <lang>Pali</lang>; the context in <ls>Divy</ls> is my only source of knowledge of the meaning. It can hardly mean <i>members of the dvādaśavarga</i>, <ab>q.v.</ab>, in the sense of <i>quorum for ordination</i>. Apparently these nuns were given to cavilling and trouble-making; they object to functions assigned to (Cūḍa-)Panthaka."
