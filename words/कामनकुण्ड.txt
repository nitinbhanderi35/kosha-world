Literally it means a bowl, pitcher, a vessel for coals, or a round hole in the ground (for receiving and preserving water or fire. Cf. Agnikuṇḍa).<sup>22</sup> It is a Dravidian word.<sup>23</sup> We have the names of mohallas ending in ‘kuṇḍa’, such as Durgākuṇḍa, Agastyakuṇḍa, Lakṣmīkuṇḍa in Vārāṇasī. <dvsn n='P'/>As a surname, we find its use for the Nāgara brāhmaṇas.<sup>24</sup> We find many brāhmaṇa surnames popular among the kāyasthas of Bengal.<sup>25</sup> ‘Kuṇḍa’ though originally a brāhmaṇa surname is now a non-brāhmaṇa surname in Bengal. Some of the people possessing the <i>kuṇḍa</i> surname are found to be oil-men by profession. Its corrupt form <i>kuṇḍu</i> is also found."
