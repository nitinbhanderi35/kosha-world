Kṛṣṇa</i> spoke about the affairs of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and proposed to send an ambassador to <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., in order to induce them to give half the kingdom to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (V, <b>1</b>). <i>Baladeva</i> approved of it, and said that the ambassador ought to salute <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (β), that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had been wrong in challenging <i>Śakuni</i>, and that <i>Duryodhana</i> only ought to be addressed in a conciliatory tone, that war might be avoided (V, <b>2</b>). <i>Sātyaki</i> severely blamed <i>Baladeva</i>, and asserted that it was <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> who had been challenged in the game at dice, that he could not have declined according to the rules of the Kṣatriya caste, and that <i>Śakuni</i> had won by a trick; the <i>Kauravas</i> had not obeyed <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>; they ought to be besought by sharp arrows; they could not withstand <i>Yuyudhāna</i>, etc. (ββ) (V, <b>3</b>). <i>Drupada</i> approved of what had been said by <i>Baladeva</i>, except that <i>Duryodhana</i> should not be addressed mildly, and they ought also to send messengers to <i>Śalya</i>, etc. (γ) to collect an army; his own <i>purohita</i> ought to be sent to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana, Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Droṇa</i> (V, <b>4</b>). Having approved of <i>Drupada's</i> words, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> set out for <i>Dvārakā</i>, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> began to make preparations for war, and collect troops; and <i>Drupada</i> despatched his <i>purohita</i> to the <i>Kurus</i> (V, <b>5</b>). <i>Drupada</i> gave instructions to his <i>purohita</i> (cf. Puṣya, § 554), who set out for <i>Hāstinapura</i> with a following of disciples (V, <b>6</b>). After <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (γγ) had set out for <i>Dvārakā, Arjuna</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> come thither, while <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was asleep; <i>Duryodhana</i> sat down at the head of the bed; after him <i>Arjuna</i> came and stood at the back of the bed. And when <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> awoke, he first saw <i>Arjuna. Arjuna</i> chose for his partner <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> himself, who was not to fight; <i>Duryodhana</i> selected for himself <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> ten crores of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> cowherds. <i>Balarāma</i> said he would fight neither for <i>Kuntī's</i> sons nor for <i>Duryodhana. Kṛtavarman</i> gave an <i>akṣauhiṇī</i> to <i>Duryodhana. Kṛṣṇa</i> promised to become <i>Arjuna's</i> charioteer; <i>Arjuna</i> came back to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and the flower of the <i>Daśārha</i> race (V, <b>7</b>).—§ 555: <i>Śalya</i> with his sons and troops (description) was advancing in order to join the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; but <i>Duryodhana</i> caused fine palaces of entertainment to be constructed at different spots for his reception; <i>Śalya</i> first thought this had been arranged by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, until <i>Duryodhana</i> came forward and showed himself; then he promised <i>Duryodhana</i> to become the leader of his army. <i>Śalya</i>, however, first proceeded to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> at <i>Upaplavya</i>, and told them about the matter. He promised <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that when he became <i>Karṇa's</i> charioteer he would act so that <i>Karṇa</i> might be dispirited; and in order to comfort <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> he reminded him that <i>Śakra (Indra</i>) had to endure, together with his wife, very great misery (V, <b>8</b>). At the request of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Śalya</i> related the ancient story (<i>itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ</i>) of the great misery endured by <i>Indra</i> and his queen (v. Indravijaya) (V, <b>9—17</b>). So <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> should also regain his kingdom. This story of the victory of <i>Indra</i>, equal to the <i>Veda</i>, should be listened to by a king desirous of victory; he who reads it with a heart full of religious faith is purified from his sins, etc. <i>Śalya</i> repeated his promise to damp the spirits of <i>Karṇa</i>, and went with his army to <i>Duryodhana</i> (V, <b>18</b>). <i>Yuyudhāna</i>, etc. (γ) came to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with troops (description). For the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> there were thus assembled seven <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> of troops from various directions. In the same way king <i>Bhagadatta</i> (with an <i>akṣauhiṇī</i> crowded with <i>Cīnas</i> and <i>Kirātas</i>), etc. (δ) came to the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>. And thus <i>Duryodhana</i> had a force which numbered eleven <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i>, so that there was no room for them in the city of <i>Hāstinapura</i>; but the <i>Pañcanada</i>, the whole <i>Kurujāṅgala</i>, etc. (ε), full of ābundant corn and wealth, was entirely overspread with the army of the <i>Kauravas</i>. And this army was beheld by the <i>purohita</i> who had been sent by the <i>Pāñcāla</i> king to the <i>Kurus</i> (V, <b>19</b>)."
