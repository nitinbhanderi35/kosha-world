Śiva swallowed and retained it in his throat, and so he came to be called Nīlakaṇṭha. <dvsn n='NI'/>“And Kālakūṭa arose like fire burning all the worlds. The smell of it sent the three worlds into a swoon. At the request of Brahmā Śiva swallowed the poison to save the world from absolute destruction. And, he (Śiva) retained it in his throat”. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 18)."
