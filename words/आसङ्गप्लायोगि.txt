Owing, however, to the addition of a curious phallic verse to the hymn, and its early misunderstanding,<sup>2</sup> a legend was invented that he lost his manhood and became a woman, but by the intercession of <b>Medhyātithi</b> was transformed into a man, much to the delight of his wife, <b>Śaśvatī,</b> whose existence is based on a misunderstanding of the phrase ‘every woman’ (<i>śaśvatī nārī</i>) in the added verse.<sup>3</sup> Another misunderstanding of the Dānastuti<sup>4</sup> gives him a son Svanad-ratha, really a mere epithet, and makes him a descendant of Yadu. <F>1) viii. 1, 32. 33.</F> <F>2) viii. 1, 34.
