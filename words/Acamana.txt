This act is called Ācamana. <Poem>“Trirācamedapaḥ pūrvaṃ Dviḥ pramṛjyāttato mukhaṃ Khāni caiva spṛśedabhir Ātmānaṃ śira eva ca”</Poem> (Manusmṛti, Śloka 60, Chapter 2). <dvsn n='NI'/>Devī Bhāgavata in its eleventh Skandha says about Ācamana like this: “Drinking water by your right hand is called ācamana. Curve your palm into the shape of a spoon, hold water in it and drink. There must be enough water in the palm to cover a green-gram seed, not less nor more. If it falls short or exceeds the measure it is considered to be like drinking alcohol. While shaping your palm neither your little finger nor your thumb should touch the other fingers. At the time of ācamana you should support your right hand by your left hand. Otherwise the water will turn impure.”"
