This corresponds to the <i>iṟaiyili</i> class of land mentioned in the Col13a inscriptions. Often this is associated with <i>aṣṭa-bhoga,</i> i. e. the eight forms of enjoying the land. For a discussion of this form of land tenure, see <i>JAHRS,</i> Vol. X, pp. 123-32. It is noteworthy that even the so-called tax-free (<i>i</i>ṟ<i>aiyili</i>) lands paid to the king certain dues of the nature of taxes. See K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, <i>The</i> <i>Co</i>l13<i>as,</i> 2nd ed., pp. 534-35. See <i>sarva-namasya,</i> etc."
