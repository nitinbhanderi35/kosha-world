There is a story about him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once all the Ṛṣis joined together in praising Indra. Śiśumāra alone remained silent without taking part in it. Seeing this, Devendra ordered Śiśumāra to praise him. The sage answered proudly that he had no time for it and that he would praise Indra for as much time as was needed to throw the water upwards. <dvsn n='NI'/>Accordingly he started praising Indra. The sage to whom Indra's praise was at first disagreeable, subsequently felt that he could not do it too much. By his austerity he acquired “Sāmavidyā”. He even composed a “Sāma” (a hymn) in praise of Indra. In later times it became famous as “Śārkarasāma”."

At the tail-end of it is Dhruva, which automatically rotates and also makes planets like the Sun and the moon to rotate. Stars follow the self-rotating Dhruva and rotate like a wheel. The Sun and the moon along with stars and planets are bound by the cord of atmosphere to Dhruva. <dvsn n='NI'/>The basis and support of this constellation of Śiśumāra is Mahāviṣṇu, who is the support of all light and effulgence. Dhruva, son of Uttānapāda came to be installed at the tail-end of Śiśumāra as he had worshipped Viṣṇu. Śiśumāra is dependent upon Viṣṇu, the Lord of all, and Dhruva is dependent upon Śiśumāra. Sūrya is dependent on Dhruva. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2, Chapter 9)."
