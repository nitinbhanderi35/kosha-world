His own commentary of the Kārikās is the book called Dhvanyāloka. There are four parts for Dhvanyāloka and each part is called an Udyota. <dvsn n='NI'/>There is a belief among a few that the Kārikās were written by another scholar, Sahṛdaya, and that Ānandavardhana had written only a commentary on it. He was a member of the royal council of Avantivarmā who ruled Kashmīr during the period 854-884 A.D. It is believed that he wrote Dhvanyāloka in 850 A.D. Many commentaries have been written of Dhvanyāloka of which the one written by Abhinavagupta is considered to be the best."
