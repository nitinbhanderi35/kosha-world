One day, when the gods and <i>rājarṣis</i> were worshipping <i>Brahmán</i>, the <i>Wind</i> loosened the garments of <i>Gaṅgā</i>. The gods bent down their heads, but <i>Mahābhiṣa</i> rudely stared at her, and for this <i>Brahmán</i> cursed him, saying that he should be reborn on earth, [as should also <i>Gaṅgā</i>, but when his wrath should be provoked by her he should again attain to heaven] (the words in brackets are only to be found in B.). He then wished to be born as a son of <i>Pratīpa</i>. The <i>Vasus</i> had been cursed by the ṛṣi <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, whom they had crossed when he was engaged in his twilight adorations, that they should be born among men. They chose to be born of <i>Gaṅgā</i> as sons to <i>Śāntanu</i>, who should be borne to <i>Pratīpa</i>, and <i>Gaṅgā</i> promised that she would throw them into the water as soon as they were born, except one, upon whom they would each contribute one-eighth of their energies, but who should be childless (I, <b>96</b>). (For continuation v. Śāntanūpākhyāna.)"
