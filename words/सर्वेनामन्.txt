            "content": "pronoun: lit. standing for any noun. There is no definition as such given, of the word pronoun, but the words, called pronouns, are enumerated in Panini's grammar one after another in the class or group headed by सर्व (सर्व, विश्व, उभ, उभय, words ending in the affixes डतर and डतम, अन्य etc.)which appear to be pronouns primarily. Some words such as पूर्व, पर, अवर, दक्षिण, उत्तर, अपर, अधर, स्व, अन्तर etc are treated as pronouns under certain conditions. In any case, attention has to be paid to the literal sense of the term सर्वनामन् which is an ancient term and none of these words when standing as a proper noun, is to be treated as a pronoun: cf. सर्वादीनि सर्वनामानि P. I.1. 27, cf. also संज्ञोपसर्जनीभूतास्तु न सर्वादयःः M.Bh. on P. I. 1. 27 Vart. 2; (2) The word सर्वनामन् means also a common term, a general term; cf. एकश्रुतिः स्वरसर्वनाम, यथा नपुंसकं लिङ्गसर्वनाम M. Bh. on P. VI. 4.174 Vart 4."
