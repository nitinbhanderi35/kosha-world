            "content": "[<b>Gaṅgāvataraṇa(ṃ)</b>]¦ (“descent of the Gaṅgā”). § 389 (Sagara): Asked by <i>Sagara</i> to bring back the horse and deliver him from hell (<i>Narakād), Aṃśumat</i> went to the spot where the earth had been excavated, entered the sea by that very way, and beheld <i>Kapila</i> and the horse. As he bowed his head before <i>Kapila</i>, etc., <i>Kapila</i> granted him the horse, and that his fathers should be purified and go to heaven, when his son's son, by the favour of <i>Śiva</i>, brought <i>Tripathagā</i> (i.e. Gaṅgā) from heaven. When he had brought the horse back to the sacrificial yard and narrated all the events to <i>Sagara, Sagara</i> grieved no more, but praised <i>Aṃśumat</i> and finished the sacrificial rites. <i>Sagara</i> was greeted by all the gods and converted the sea into a son of himself (<i>putratve</i> <i>kalpayām āsa</i>), and after a long reign placed his grandson on the throne and ascended to heaven. <i>Aṃśumat</i> ruled the whole earth like <i>Sagara</i>, and died after he had placed his son <i>Dilīpa</i> on the throne. <i>Dilīpa</i> in vain tried to effect the descent of <i>Gaṅgā</i> in order to raise his forefathers. He then anointed his son <i>Bhagīratha</i> as king, and practised austerities in the forest, and then ascended to heaven (III, <b>107</b>). <i>Bhagīratha</i> made over his kingly duties to his minister (<i>sacive</i>), and (<i>b</i>) practised austerities on the <i>Himavat</i> during 1000 celestial years, living upon fruits, roots, and water. Then <i>Gaṅgā Haimavatī</i> appeared in a material form (<i>mūrtimatī</i>), and promised to besprinkle the bodies of his forefathers and carry them to heaven, and as there existed none in the three worlds except <i>Śiva</i>, who was able to sustain her fall, she caused <i>Bhagīratha</i> to go to <i>Kailāsa</i>, where he, by his austerities, obtained the favour of <i>Śiva</i> (III, <b>108</b>), who, surrounded by his awful attendants (<i>pāriṣadaiḥ</i>), came to <i>Himavat</i>. There he caused <i>Bhagīratha</i> to pray to <i>Gaṅgā</i>. <i>Gaṅgā</i> immediately came down from the sky, in the presence of the gods, <i>maharṣis, Gandharvas, snakes</i>, and <i>Yakṣas</i>, and <i>Śiva</i> received her on his forehead, whence she fell to the earth, divided into three streams. At her request <i>Bhagīratha</i> led her to the spot where the bodies of <i>Sagara's</i> sons lay, while <i>Śiva</i> went to <i>Kailāsa</i> with the celestials. <i>Gaṅgā</i> filled the sea, and <i>Bhagīratha</i> adopted her as his daughter and offered libations of water to his forefathers (III, <b>109</b>)."
