This worship is to be conducted in the months of Āṣāḍha (July), Śrāvaṇa (August) Prauṣṭhapada (September), Āśvina (October) and Kārttika (November) A sacred Pavitra (sacred thread or ring of Kuśa grass) is to be prepared either in gold, silver, copper, cotton or silk. A specially purified cotton thread is also enough The Pavitra is to be made of three threads woven together. The Pavitra is to be made holy by reciting 108 times the Gāyatrī mantra or even half of that number is enough. Reciting 108 times or more is considered to be Uttama (best); half of it is considered Madhyama (tolerable) and less than it is considered adhama (worst). The Pavitra should then be tied to maṇḍalas and the mantra to be recited at the time of tying it, is this: <Poem>Oṃ Nārāyaṇāya vidmahe Vāsudevāya Dhīmahi tanno Viṣṇuḥ pracodayāt.</Poem> (Chapter 34, Agni Purāṇa)."
