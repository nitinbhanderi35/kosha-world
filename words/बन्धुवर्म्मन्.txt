He was probably a feudatory chief, ruling at Dasapura, Mandasor in Western Malwa,<sup>41</sup> in the time of Kumāragupta I. He has been mentioned as a king (nṛpa) governing the city of Daśapura and it was under his rulership that the Sun-temple was caused to be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Mandasor (Daśapura). The relevant lines in the inscription lay a stress on his name Bandhu. He is described as possessed of firmness and statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were, of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) connections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his) proud enemies.<sup>42</sup> Varman is a kṣatriya surname meaning ‘the protector’, the entire expression may literally be translated as ‘the protector of his relatives’."
