Śambhu, who was engaged in tapas in Daṇḍaka forest when Śrī Rāma visited the forest was attracted by the beauty of Sītā and transformed himself into a tree to enjoy her beauty with his eyes. Lakṣmaṇa, who was felling down trees to build an āśrama felled this tree also, which disappeared immediately leaving behind the dead body of a Rākṣasa. It was the corpse of the Rākṣasa and Rāma comforted Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa by revealing the fact to them. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa. Araṇyakāṇḍa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Uttara Rāmāyaṇa contains a story of how Devavatī (or Vedavatī) daughter of Kuśadhvaja once cursed Śambhu. Devavatī was born from the mouth of Kuśadhvaja (son of Bṛhaspati) while he was learning the Vedas. Śambhu wanted to marry the child when she was grown up, but Kuśadhvaja did not consent to it, and Śambhu, in retaliation, killed Kuśadhvaja in his sleep. Next morning Devavatī awoke from sleep to see the dead body of her father. She cursed Śambhu. Her curse was a contributory cause for the death of Śambhu by Lakṣmaṇa."
