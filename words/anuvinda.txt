(3) An Akṣauhiṇī (division of army) was despatched by Anuvinda to help Duryodhana. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verses 24, 25). (4) On the first day of the war Vinda and Anuvinda fought duels with Kuntibhoja. (M.B., Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 45, Verses 72-75). (5) Irāvān, son of Arjuna defeated both Vinda and Anuvinda in the battle. (M.B., Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 83, Verse, 18-22). (6) They fought with Bhīma, Arjuna and the king of Virāṭa.

The three of them were the children of Rājādhidevī, sister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father. Śrī Kṛṣṇa married Mitravindā, which her brother did not like. This was their reason for quitting the Pāṇḍava camp and fighting on the side of the Kauravas. (Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha, Chapter 58, Verses 30, 31)."
