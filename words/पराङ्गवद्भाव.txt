            "content": "behaviour as having become a part and parcel of another ; treatment of a word as a part of another. The term is used by Panini in connection with a word followed by and connected with a word in the vocative case of which it is looked upon as a part for purposes of accent, e. g. कुण्डेनाटन्, मद्राणां राजन् etc. Here the words अटन् and राजन्, being in the vocative case, are आद्युदात्त, i.e. अ (at the beginning of अटन्) and आ (in राजन्) are acute and as a result all the other vowels in कुण्डेनाटन् and मद्राणां राजन् become अनुदात्त or grave; cf. सुबामन्त्रिते पराङ्गवत्स्वरे P.II.1.2."
