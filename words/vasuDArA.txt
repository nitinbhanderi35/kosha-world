If one gives offering to the manes after getting oneself purified by bathing in this holy tīrtha (bath), one will attain the world of Viṣṇu. There is a lake of the Aṣṭavasus (eight Vasus) in this place. By bathing there, one could become the subject of the love and regard of the eight Vasus. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Stanza 63)."
