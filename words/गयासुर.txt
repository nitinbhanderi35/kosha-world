Gayāsura with whom Viṣṇu was pleased was granted his request, to be the best of all; Yamapuri became vacant; all went to Brahmā and he went to Viṣṇu; on the latter's advice Brahmā went to Gayā and wanted to perform yāga on his body; a true devotee, Gaya agreed readily. But finding him unstable Brahmā ordered Dharma to place a stone on his head and the devas to stand to maintain balance; Viṣnu was again approached who gave his mūrti and finding Gaya still unstable Gadādhara himself took his stand and made the stone motionless. Pleased, Viṣṇu gave him what he desired. It was that they should all live there and that the people who did rites there must reach Brahmaloka. See Gayā tīrtham. <dvsn n='P'/>Vā. 105. 5-13. ch. 106.
