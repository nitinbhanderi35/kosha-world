But he could not get suitable priest as the performer of the sacrifice. So Brahmā decided to create a befitting person as Ṛtvik (the priest who does the rituals of the sacrifice) and he got pregnant in his head. After a thousand years he sneezed and a Prajāpati came out of the head of Brahmā. That Prajāpati was Kṣupa. He made Kṣupa his Ṛtvik. (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 122). <dvsn n='NI'/>Rudra Bhagavān made him Prajāpati (the Lord of all subjects)."
