He used some sounds too often in his talks. <dvsn n='NI'/>Nṛmedhas and Parucchepa vied with each other in their māntric skill. One day Nṛmedhas in great pride produced smoke from wet firewood without igniting it and then Parucchepa produced fire without firewood. Nṛmedhas admitted defeat. (Taittirīya Saṃhitā)."
