Rāma</i> constructed a bridge across the deep, and, followed by myriads of monkeys, he slew <i>Rāvaṇa</i>, his brother, sons, and kindred, together with all the <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and installed the pious <i>Rākṣasa</i> chief <i>Vibhīṣaṇa</i> in the kingdom in <i>Laṅkā</i>, and then returned with <i>Sītā</i> to his city <i>Ayodhyā</i>, and was established in the kingdom. <i>Rāma</i> granted to <i>Hanūmat</i> that he should live as long as the history of <i>Rāma's</i> deeds is remembered on earth. <i>Rāma</i> went to his own abode after having reigned 11,000 years. From that time all excellent objects of entertainment were, through the grace of <i>Sītā</i>, supplied to <i>Hanūmat</i>, who constantly stayed there hearing the deeds of <i>Rāma</i> sung by <i>Apsarases</i> and <i>Gandharvas</i> (cf. v. 11, 323). He had obstructed this path of the gods to <i>Bhīma</i> with the view that none might defeat or curse him (III, <b>148</b>).—§ 426: When <i>Bhīma</i> asked <i>Hanūmat</i> to show him the form he had when crossing the ocean, <i>Hanūmat</i> declared this to be impossible, as all things diminish according to the different <i>yugas</i>, even the <i>Siddhas</i>, gods, and great <i>ṛṣis</i>. Then he described the <i>Kṛta-</i> <i>yuga(b</i>) and the <i>Tretā</i> (q.v., § 427), <i>Dvāpara</i> (q.v., § 428), and <i>Kaliyuga</i> (q.v., § 429).—§ 430: <i>Hanūmat</i> was prevailed upon to grant the request of <i>Bhīma</i> (see § 426), and showed himself as great as the <i>Vindhya</i> or the <i>Maināka</i> mountain, and said that he might become as long as he wished; he had himself been able to slay <i>Rāvaṇa</i>, but would not obscure the glory of <i>Rāma</i>. He pointed out to <i>Bhīma</i> the way to the <i>Saugandhika-</i> <i>vana</i> and the garden of <i>Kubera</i>, which was guarded by <i>Yakṣas</i> and <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and warned him against plucking the flowers himself, delivering a discourse upon the duties of the four castes, etc. (III, <b>150</b>)."
