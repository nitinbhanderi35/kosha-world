I shall record such <ab>mgs.</ab>, even where texts read āb°, under <b>āvarhati</b>; in <lang>BHS</lang> the two groups are not clearly distinguishable. They may even be identical in origin, as <ls>N. Dutt</ls> holds, <ls>MSV</ls> 〔iii.74 n. 3〕 (<i>withdrawal of offences</i> committed by the monk implies restoration to good standing); so also in essence, <ab>tho</ab> doubtfully, <ls>Finot, Prāt</ls> 〔488 n. 1〕. But on this theory it is hard to explain <lang>Pali</lang> abbheti (abbhāna), and I incline to believe that <lang>BHS</lang> has a secondary and confused blend, in which a form close to the <lang>Pali</lang>, meaning <i>recall</i>, was adapted to the word meaning <i>extract, remove</i>."
