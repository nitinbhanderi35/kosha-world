While they, in days of old, practised penances, preparing themselves for (<i>upaśikṣanto</i>) <i>Brahmaloka</i> by yoga meditation (<i>samādhinā</i>), there occurred a severe drought; <i>Śibi's</i> son <i>Śaibya</i> had in former times given away a son of his as the sacrificial present to the <i>ṛtvijes</i>; that prince now died of starvation; impelled by hunger, the <i>Ṛṣis</i> cooked his body in a vessel. King <i>Śaibya Vṛṣādarbhi</i> came and offered to give them kine, etc., but they refused it: that acceptance of gifts from a king was poison; they left the spot abandoning that flesh. The king sent his ministers with figs, some of which were filled with gold; but <i>Atri</i>, finding them heavy, refused to take them; and so did all of them (β), and left the spot. Filled with wrath, <i>Vṛṣādarbhi</i>, after having observed penances, poured libations into the fire accompanied by <i>mantras</i>; from the fire a hag (<i>kṛtyā</i>) sprang forth, whom he called <i>Yātudhānī</i>; he ordered her to slay the <i>Ṛṣis</i>, etc., having ascertained their names. While Ṛ. roved within the forest, subsisting upon fruits and roots, they saw a well-nourished mendicant [called further below <i>Śunaḥsakha</i>] with a dog in good condition; <i>Arundhatī</i> pointed him out to them, and each of them explained the superior condition of this mendicant with reference to one of the points in which he was better situated than they(γ). The wandering mendicant approached them and touched their hand according to custom. One day they beheld a beautiful lake overgrown with lotuses, and desired to gather some lotus-stalks; urged by <i>Vṛṣādarbhi, Yātu-</i> <i>dhānī</i>, who guarded the lake, would know their names before they took the stalks; <i>Atri</i> knew that she stood there in order to slay them; but they all told their names with their etymological explanations (δ); at each explanation <i>Yātudhānī</i> declared that she did not understand it, [in some cases] “in consequence of the inflections which the roots had undergone”; <i>Śunaḥsakha</i> calls himself <i>Śunaḥsakha-sakhi</i>, and as <i>Yātudhānī</i> wishes to hear the name once more in order to understand it, he struck her head with his triple stick, at which she was consumed to ashes. Having gathered lotus-stalks, they once more plunged into the lake in order to offer oblations of water to the <i>Pitṛs</i>. As they came up, the stalks were nowhere to be seen. They took, each of them, oaths to their innocence(ε); but the oath of <i>Śunaḥsakha</i> was “no oath at all,” and he confessed that he had stolen the stalks from desire of testing them; he turned out to be <i>Indra</i>, who had come to test them, and told them the whole matter about <i>Yātudhānī</i>. They then ascended to heaven in the company of <i>Indra</i> himself* (XIII, <b>93</b>)."
