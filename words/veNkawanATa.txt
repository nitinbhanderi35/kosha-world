The major poetic work “Rāghavābhyudaya” of Veṅkaṭanātha consists of twentyfour kāṇḍas. This is a beautiful poetic work. Appayyadīkṣitar has written a commentary on this work. This poet Veṅkaṭanātha, who was also known by the name “Vedāntadeśika”, was a great philosopher too. It is said that his native place was Tuppil, near Khānsi. Most of his works are based on theosophy and on the philosophy of oneness of man with God. <dvsn n='NI'/>Veṅkaṭanātha was born in 1268 and died in November 1369, as critics say. Even today he is esteemed and venerated as a divine person."
