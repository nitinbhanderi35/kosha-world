When he was a child he used to gather pebbles and make a heap and then worship it, imagining it to be Gaṇeśa (Gaṇapati). <dvsn n='NI'/>His parents did not like this. They tried their best to dissuade him from this habit. Once they tied him to a tree and gave him severe cuts. But their attempts were futile. One day an image of Gaṇapati arose in the place where the child used to worship. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa 1:2)."
