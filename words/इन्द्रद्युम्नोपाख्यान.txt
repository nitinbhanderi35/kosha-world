Then a chariot came from heaven, and a celestial voice called <i>Indradyumna</i> back to heaven (vv. 13343—5, three <i>ślokas</i> are cited; v. 13343: ‘The report of a virtuous deed reaches heaven and earth; as long as that report is heard, so long is the doer said to be in heaven’). He first brought me and the owl to our respective places, and then went away in that chariot.” The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> praised <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> for having caused <i>Indradyumna</i> to regain his sphere; he said that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> also had raised the <i>rājarṣi Nṛga</i> from hell and caused him to regain heaven (III, <b>199</b>)."
