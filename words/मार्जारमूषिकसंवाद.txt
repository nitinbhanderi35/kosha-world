On the branches lived a cat <i>Lomaśa</i>. A <i>Cāṇḍāla</i> came and built a hut, setting his traps of leather strings every evening after sunset. One day he caught the cat. <i>Palita</i> began to eat the flesh in the trap, but beheld the mongoose <i>Harito</i> and the owl <i>Candraka</i>. He resolved upon saving the cat though an enemy, in order to escape from them; having made peace with the cat, he crouched beneath it; the mongoose and owl left the spot; the mouse began to cut the strings slowly, notwithstanding the cat's impatience. At morning the <i>Cāṇḍāla Parigha</i> appeared (description), accompanied by a pack of dogs. Then the mouse quickly cut the remaining string; the cat got upon the banyan, <i>Palita</i> entered his hole. The hunter took up his net and left the spot. <i>Palita</i> would not conclude friendship with the cat, and entered another hole."
