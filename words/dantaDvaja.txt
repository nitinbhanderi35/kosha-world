So he put his hair of the body, of the head, his sinews, the marrow of the bones, and liver and sperm in the fire. When the sperm was put in the fire there was a voice ‘Don't’ and with that the king fell dead. And instantly seven luminous children came out from the fire. They began to cry aloud. Hearing their cry Brahmā came there and anointed them as the Maruts (wind gods). They were the maruts of Tāmasamanvantara. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 72)."
