On an appeal from Rukmiṇī to spare his life, Rukmi was put to shame by the removal of his locks of hair and moustache and tied to his chariot; could not reconcile himself with Kṛṣṇa's action and resolved to kill Kṛṣṇa and then enter Kuṇḍina. Released by Balarāma, he built and lived in Bhojakaṭa without going back to Kuṇḍina.<sup>2</sup> Was met by Śālva at Kuṇḍina; was stationed by Jarāsandha at the western gate of Mathurā and on the eastern side during the siege of Gomanta.<sup>3</sup> Gave his daughter to Pradyumna in marriage to please his sister, but continued to hate Kṛṣṇa; prayed to Śiva who gave him a bow saying that it would not harm Hari; went back to Bhojakaṭa, afraid of meeting Kṛṣṇa.<sup>4</sup> Gave his granddaughter to Aniruddha in marriage. When he invited Rāma for a game of dice on the occasion, he played falsely and insulted Balarāma (s.v.) as a cowherd and forester at which he was struck dead. Kṛṣṇa passed no comments on his death out of consideration for his brother and Rukmiṇī.<sup>5</sup> <F>1) Bhā. X. 52. 22; 60. 18; Vi. V. 28. 9; Br. IV. 29. 122.</F> <F>2) Bhā.
