Nīla <i>jīvajīvakaḥ śākunikaḥ sa hi</i> <i>ayaṃ pakṣī asyāṃ diśi lābhaṃ asyām</i> <i>alābhaṃ diśatīti varṇayati /pakṣiviśesa ity</i> <i>anye</i> on 12. 139. 6 Bom. Ed.), understood the meaning of the cries of all beings (<i>rutajñā sarvabhūtānāṃ yathā vai jīvajīva-</i> <i>kaḥ</i>) 12. 137. 6. <b>C.</b> Her son's death: Her lustrous son grew in the palace with the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the seashore two fruits, one for her son and one for the prince; one day the prince, while playing with the young bird, killed him in a secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with two fruits she found her young one dead; she lamented over her son's loss and blamed the Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the prince with her talons; she said that a sinful act, deliberately committed, returned quickly on the doer and that taking revenge did not destroy one's good and bad (?) acts (<i>iccha-</i> <i>yaiva kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ sadya evopasarpati /</i> <i>kṛtapratikriyaṃ teṣāṃ na naśyati śubhā-</i> <i>śubham</i>) 12. 137. 7-19. <b>D.</b> King Brahmadatta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him since she had already retaliated for the misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree with the king saying that wise men recommended abandoning the place where misdeed was committed; enmities, once arisen, never subsided, hence no trust should be reposed in the enemy; the purpose for which she lived in the palace was no longer there; spirited men should abandon the place where after receiving honour they are dishonoured; she said to the king: “I have lived here long enough; now I go, may you be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded with her saying that when some one retaliated nothing wrong was committed and therefore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did not consent saying that enmities never passed off (<i>nāsti vairam upakrāntam</i> 12. 137. 34); no one should feel secure with the thought that reconciliation had come about; she pointed out to the king five causes of enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad) speech, rivalry, and misdeed (<i>strīkṛtaṃ</i> <i>vāstujaṃ vāgjaṃ sasapatnāparādhajam</i> 12. 137. 38); she lived with the king as long as nothing wrong happened; once that happened, she could trust the king no more; the king then put the entire responsibility of what had happened on Time (Kāla); since men were driven to act by Time nobody did anything wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī for her act, so should she forgive him for what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for everything, why did men seek to take revenge ? Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each other ? Why did men give and take medicines during illness ? She injured the king's son who had killed her son; now it was the king's turn to capture her; men wanted birds either for eating or for sporting; there was no third ground for the two to come together; if Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would be revived every time she remembered her son; she then recited two <i>gāthās</i> which Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137. 67-68); the purport of the <i>gāthās</i> was that one who trusted the words of enemies was killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed in a well) covered with dry grass (<i>te</i> <i>śraddadhānā vadhyante madhu śuṣkatṛṇair</i> <i>yathā / </i> Nī. <i>śatruṇā darśitaṃ puraḥsthitaṃ</i> <i>madhu śraddadhānā śuṣkatṛṇaiś channe</i> <i>prapāte yathā patanti tadvad ete ity arthaḥ</i> on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities continued because they were told to successive generations; when Brahmadatta further argued that trust had to be placed somewhere to achieve one's objective or else one would live like a dead person, Pūjanī replied that if a person continued to run with injured feet, his feet got more hurt; she gave the king a long lecture on how one should guard one's interest by remaining alert and with constant exertion; one should leave the place where one was dishonoured; since Brahmadatta's son had done something which could not be repaired she had to leave the place; she also lectured on the king's duties (offering protection to subjects and not torturing them by levying heavy taxes); having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137. 70-108); this conversation (<i>saha bhāṣītam</i>) between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109)."
