The couple procreated two children, Anṛta and Nikṛti, and from them sprang up Bhaya (fear), Naraka (Hell), Māyā (illusion), Vedanā (pain) etc. And, out of them Māyā brought forth Death, the destroyer of (all) objects. Vedanā, in its turn produced Sorrow and Grief out of Raurava. From Death were born Disease, Senility, Sorrow, Intense desire and Anger. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20)."
