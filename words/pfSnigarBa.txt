There are two opinions in the Purāṇas regarding how Viṣṇu got this name. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) In the early part of the period of Svāyambhuva Manu the Prajāpati named Sutapas and his wife Pṛśni did penance for twelve thousand divine years to get Viṣṇu as their son. As a result of that Viṣṇu was born in the womb of Pṛśni as Pṛśnigarbha. The name was suited for Śrī Kṛṣṇa the incarnation of Viṣṇu also. (Chapter 3, 10th Skandha, Bhāgavata). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) Anna (rice), Veda, Jala (water) and amṛta (nectar) are called Pṛśni and so Mahāviṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa) who bears these inside is called Pṛśnigarbha. (Śloka 45, Chapter 342, Śānti Parva)."
