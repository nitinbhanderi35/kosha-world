            "content": "SAÑJAYA I¦. Minister of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Birth.</i> Sañjaya, who was equal to a hermit, was born as the son of Sūta from a portion of Gavalgaṇa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 93). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>The boon of Sañjaya.</i> Sañjaya who was born within the circle of the friends of the Kauravas, became the minister of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. The great work that Sañjaya did in Mahābhārata was, telling Dhṛtarāṣṭra every thing that was taking place in the battle-field without leaving even the smallest events in the order of their occurrence. Sañjaya was able to do this because of the boon granted by Vyāsa. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the armies of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas pitched their camps on either side of the battlefield, Vedavyāsa came to Hastināpura and saw Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard about the preparations on either side for the battle. He did not like to go to the battle-field and see for himself the events of the battle. He said so to Vyāsa. Then Vyāsa called Sañjaya to him and said “Sañjaya shall see all the events of the battle directly. He shall have such a divine inward eye.” Vyāsa continued. “O king! Sañjaya has inward eyes. He will tell you everything about the battle. He will be knowing all. Whenever he thinks of it he will see everything that takes place in the day and in the night in open, and in secret. No weapon will cut him and no weariness will affect him. He is the son of Gavalgaṇa and will come away unhurt from the battle.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Because of this blessing Sañjaya used to inform Dhṛtarāṣṭra of all the events in the battle at the time of the occurrence. Sañjaya informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the news up to the death of Duryodhana. When Duryodhana was killed the cry of Aśvatthāmā grew louder. Sañjaya who heard this cry early in the morning, ran to the battlefield with a broken heart. With the death of Duryodhana the boon of inward eye given to Sañjaya by Vyāsa was lost. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 2; Sauptika Parva, Chapter 9). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Sañjaya stood as the host in the Rājasūya sacrifice of Yudhiṣṭhira, and received the guests and showed them hospitality.

(Sabhā Parva, Chapter 81, Verse 5). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Vidura got angry because the Pāṇḍavas were sent to live in the forest, and leaving the Kauravas he also went to the forest. Knowing that Vidura was in the Kāmyaka forest, Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent Sañjaya and brought Vidura back. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 5). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the others vowed at the Kāmyakavana to kill Duryodhana. Sañjaya gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra a detailed description of that Vow. (M.B.
