Then <i>Yāja</i> summoned the queen (<i>Pṛṣatī</i>, v. 6390; <i>Pārṣatī</i>, v. 6405; “daughter-in-law of <i>Pṛṣata</i>,” PCR.), but she said that she was not fit for accepting the offspring (?), her mouth being unclean (<i>avalipta</i>) and her person perfumed. <i>Yāja</i> replied: “Since the sacrifice has been prepared (<i>śrapitaṃ</i>) by <i>Yāja</i> and sanctified by <i>Upayāja's</i> invocations (<i>abhimantritaṃ</i>), it shall produce its effect whether thou comest or waitest.” Then arose from the flames a boy with a crown on his head, his body being arrayed in excellent armour, sword in hand and carrying a bow and arrows, sending forth loud roars, and immediately ascending a chariot. A great invisible being in the skies said that he would destroy <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. After this <i>Pāñcālī</i> arose from the centre of the <i>vedī</i>, and a voice, not coming from a visible body, said that she would be the cause of the destruction of many <i>kṣatriyas</i>. At the birth of both children the <i>Pāñcālas</i> shouted with joy. The queen was regarded as their mother. Then the <i>brahmans</i> gave to the boy the name of <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, on account of his audacity, etc. (<i>dhṛṣṭatvād atidhṛṣṇutvād dyumnādyutsam-</i> <i>bhavād api</i>, v. 6406), and to the girl that of <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, on account of her dark complexion (v. 6407). <i>Droṇa</i> brought <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> to his own abode, and taught him the use of all weapons, considering that destiny is inevitable (I, <b>167</b>)."
