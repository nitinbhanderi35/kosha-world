Owing to his association with Harimitra a sinner called Vikuṇḍala took his bath in the sacred waters of the Kālindī during two Māgha months. The first bath released him from all his sins and the second bath made him eligible to go to heaven. Thus Harimitra was responsible for the attainment of heaven by the sinner Vikuṇḍala. (Padma Purāṇa, Ādi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 31)."
