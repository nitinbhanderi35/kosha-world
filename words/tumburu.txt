He was the best musician among the Gandharvas. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Birth.</i> Tumburu was the son of Kaśyapa, son of Marīci and grandson of Brahmā, born of his wife Pradhā. Of the sons of Kaśyapa the four Gandharva sons, Tumburu, Bāhu, Hāhā and Hūhū were noted for their sweet and pleasant conversation. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Tumburu and the Pāṇḍavas.</i> Mahābhārata states about several occasions when Tumburu has shown a special and deep interest in the Pāṇḍavas. The following few are of special mention— <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Tumburu attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna. (Śloka 54, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Once this Gandharva gave Yudhiṣṭhira a hundred horses. (Śloka 24, Chapter 52, Sabhā Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Tumburu welcomed Arjuna when the latter went to Devaloka at the invitation of Indra. (Vana Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 14). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Once when the Pāṇḍavas were living incognito in the country of Virāṭa the Kauravas carried away the cattle of the King. Arjuna in disguise then fought against the Kauravas and Tumburu watched the fight with interest. (Śloka 12, Chapter 56, Virāṭa Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Tumburu was present at the Aśvamedhayāga of Yudhiṣṭhira. (Śloka 39, Chapter 88, Aśvamedha Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>How Tumburu was born as Virādha.</i> When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were in the forests in exile a demon named Virādha attacked them. That demon was none other than Tumburu. Once when Tumburu was living in the city of Kubera he committed a sin and Kubera cursed him and made him into a demon. Kubera had then told him that he would get relief from the curse when he was slain by Rāma, son of Daśaratha. Śrī Rāma killed Virādha and the latter regaining the form of Tumburu left for Gandharvaloka. (See under Virādha). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>How he cursed Purūravas.</i> It is found in Kathāsaritsāgara that the temporary separation which Purūravas had from Urvaśī was due to a curse by the Gandharva Tumburu. <dvsn n='NI'/>After marrying Urvaśī Purūravas once went to Devaloka at the invitation of Indra. He was invited to help Indra in his fight against the asuras. Indra celebrated the day on which one of the best of the demons, Māyādhara was killed. Rambhā was dancing before ācārya Tumburu on the occasion and Purūravas finding fault with her dance mocked at her. Rambhā felt insulted and asked the King thus: “Fool of a King, what do you know of the divine dances of Devaloka?” Purūravas retorted that he had learnt more of dancing from Urvaśī than what her preceptor Tumburu knew. Tumburu got angry and cursed Purūravas that he would live separated from Urvaśī till he did penance to please Mahāviṣṇu. The Gandharvas then carried away Urvaśī from Purūravas. (See under Purūravas). <dvsn n='NI'/>5) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) Tumburu was a member of the court of Indra. (Śloka 14, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Tumburu was a member of the court of Kubera. (Śloka 26, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) The songs of Tumburu who was a worshipper of Kubera used to be heard from the mountain of Gandhamādana on the full-moon day. (Śloka 29, Chapter 159, Vana Parva)."
