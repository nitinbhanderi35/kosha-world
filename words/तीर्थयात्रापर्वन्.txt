Tīrthayātrā). § 356: <i>Draupadī</i>, <i>Bhīmasena, Nakula</i>, and <i>Sahadeva</i> lamented <i>Arjuna; Sahadeva</i> suggested to move from the <i>Kāmyaka</i> wood (III, <b>80</b>). Then came the <i>devarṣi Nārada</i> who, at the request of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, told them what the <i>brahmarṣi Pulastya</i> had formerly said to <i>Bhīṣma</i> about the merits of circumambulating (<i>pradakṣiṇāṃ</i> <i>yaḥ kurute</i>) the earth for the purpose of visiting the <i>tīrthas</i>, when <i>Bhīṣma</i> was engaged in a <i>pitrya vrata</i> at <i>Gaṅgādvāra</i> (resorted to by <i>devarṣis, Gandharvas</i>, and gods) in the company of <i>munis</i>, and made oblations to the <i>pitṛs</i>, gods, and <i>ṛṣis</i> (III, <b>81</b>). At <i>Bhīṣma's</i> request <i>Pulastya</i> explained the qualities of a person who will acquire merit by visiting <i>tīrthas</i>; he said that the costly sacrifices, which only kings and very rich men are capable of affording, are not of greater merit than a sojourn in <i>tīrthas</i>, which even the poorest may accomplish.—§ 357: Then he first described <i>Puṣkara</i> (q.v.).— § 358: Then he enumerated a great many of tīrthas and the merit of visiting them.—§ 359: <i>Vaḍavā</i> (q.v.).—§ 360: <i>Pulastya's</i> enumeration of tīrthas continued (III, <b>82</b>).— § 361: <i>Kurukṣetra</i> (q.v.).—§ 362: The enumeration continued.—§ 363: <i>Rāmahradāḥ</i> (q.v.).—§ 364: The enumeration continued.—§ 365: <i>Maṅkaṇaka</i> (q.v.).—§ 366: The enumeration continued.—§ 367: <i>Prthūdaka</i> (q.v.).—§ 368: The enumeration continued.—§ 369: <i>Kurukṣetra</i> (q.v.).— § 370: The enumeration continued (III, <b>84</b>).—§ 371: <i>Tuṅgaka</i> (q.v.).—§ 372: The enumeration continued.— § 373: <i>Prayāga</i> (q.v.).—§ 374: The enumeration continued. —§ 375: <i>Gaṅgā</i> is equal to <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, wherever one may bathe in it, especially in <i>Kanakhala</i> and in <i>Prayāga</i>, which is the most excellent; a bath in the <i>Gaṅgā</i> in that place removes 100 sins. In the <i>Kṛtayuga</i> all the tīrthas were sacred, in the <i>Tretāyuga Puṣkara</i> alone, in the <i>Dvāpara</i> <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, in the <i>Kaliyuga Gaṅgā</i>. In <i>Puṣkara</i> one should practise austerities, in <i>Mahālaya</i> one should make gifts, on the <i>Malaya</i> one should ascend the funeral pyre, in <i>Bhṛgutuṅga</i> one should kill oneself by fasting; bathing in <i>Puṣkara, Kurukṣetra</i>, the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, and <i>Magadha</i> (PCR. seems to have had another reading) one purifies seven generations of one's race upwards and downwards, etc.; as long as one's bones lie in contact with the water of the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, so long does one live, honoured in heaven (<i>Svargaloke). Pitāmaha</i> has said that no <i>tīrtha</i> is equal to the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, no God to <i>Keśava</i>, and none is superior to brahmans. This truthful description one should recite only to the twice-born, etc. (*). In these <i>tīrthas</i> have bathed the <i>Vasus</i>, the <i>Sādhyas</i> (so B.), the <i>Ādityas</i>, the <i>Maruts</i>, the <i>Aśvins</i>, and the <i>Ṛṣis</i>, who are equal to the gods. Only men of piety and learning are able to visit these <i>tīrthas</i> on account of their purified senses, their belief in god (<i>āstikyāt</i>), and their acquaintance with the <i>Vedas</i> (end of <i>Pulastya's</i> discourse, in which Yudhiṣṭhira sometimes is addressed instead of Bhīṣma).—§ 376: <i>Nārada</i> continued: Then <i>Pulastya</i> disappeared, and <i>Bhīṣma</i> (who understood the <i>śāstras</i>), at the command of <i>Pulastya</i>, wandered over the earth and ended his <i>tīrthayātrā</i> at <i>Prayāga</i>. The man that so walks about the earth is rewarded after death as much as for 100 horse sacrifices. “So wilt thou <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> obtain the eight-fold (<i>aṣṭaguṇaṃ) dharma</i>, as <i>Bhīṣma</i> did before, and because thou wilt lead the ṛṣis, thy merit will be eight-fold; those <i>tīrthas</i> are infested by <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and no king, save thyself, has gone there (*). The foremost of ṛṣis are always there and expect thee: <i>Vālmīki, Kaśyapa</i>, <i>Ātreya, Kuṇḍajaṭhara, Viśvāmitra, Gautama, Asita Devala</i>, <i>Mārkaṇḍeya, Gālava, Bharadvāja, Vasiṣṭha, Uddālaka</i>, <i>Śaunaka</i> with his son, <i>Vyāsa, Durvāsas</i>, and <i>Jābāli</i>. With them do thou visit these <i>tīrthas</i>. The great <i>ṛṣi Lomaśa</i> will come to thee, do thou follow him and me to these <i>tīrthas</i>.” Then <i>Nārada</i> disappeared and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> spoke to the ascetics of the <i>tīrthas</i> (III, <b>85</b>).—§ 377: <i>Dhaumya-tīrthaka-</i> <i>thana</i> (q.v.).—§ 378: While <i>Dhaumya</i> was speaking thus, <i>Lomaśa</i> arrived and told that <i>Arjuna</i> had obtained <i>Brahma-</i> <i>śiras-(b</i>), learnt the <i>Gāndharva Veda</i>, etc. (III, <b>91</b>). <i>Lomaśa</i> said that <i>Arjuna</i> had asked him to cause <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to visit all <i>tīrthas</i>, like <i>Manu</i> and other <i>rājarṣis</i>, and protect him from the <i>Rākṣasas</i> as <i>Dadhīca</i> had protected <i>Indra</i> and <i>Aṅgiras</i> had protected the <i>Sun. Lomaśa</i> had twice before visited the <i>tīrthas</i>. At the command of <i>Lomaśa, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> caused the citizens, brahmans, and <i>Yatis</i>, who were not able to endure the privations of the journey, to return to <i>Hāsti-</i> <i>napura</i>, where <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> gave them their proper allowances from affection for <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, with only a small number of brahmans abode for three nights at <i>Kāmyaka</i> cheered by <i>Lomaśa</i> (III, <b>92</b>). The brahmans, who dwelt in the wood, prevailed upon <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that he allowed them to partake of the <i>tīrthayātrā</i>. Just when they were about to start, <i>Vyāsa, Parvata</i>, and <i>Nārada</i> came to <i>Kāmyaka</i>, and caused them not only to fulfil human vows by purifying the body, but even divine vows by purifying the heart, that it might be free from evil thoughts and harbour only friendly feelings towards everybody. When those celestial and human ṛṣis had performed the usual propitiatory ceremonies, and when they had worshipped the feet of <i>Lomaśa</i>, <i>Dvaipāyana, Nārada</i>, and the <i>devarṣi Parvata</i>, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> started towards the east with <i>Dhaumya</i> and the ascetics on the day following Mārgaśīrṣī, when <i>Puṣya</i> was in ascendance, dressed in bark and hides, with matted locks, cased in mail, and armed with swords, etc., with <i>Indrasena</i> and other attendants with some fourteen (<i>paricaturdaśaiḥ</i>) chariots and a number of cooks (III, <b>93</b>). As <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> asked why he who is virtuous is unhappy, and his enemies who are sinful, happy, <i>Lomaśa</i> said that sinful men often prosper in consequence of their sins, but at last they are overtaken by destruction, even as in the <i>devayuga</i> the <i>Daiteyas</i> and <i>Dānavas (Asuras</i>), who practised vice (<i>adharma</i>) and did not visit the <i>tīrthas</i>, for a time prospered by their sin and vanquished the gods, who practised virtue and visited the <i>tīrthas</i>; at last, when the good qualities, prosperity, etc., left the Asuras and went to the gods, while bad qualities, adversity, etc., came to the <i>Asuras</i>, and <i>Kali</i> possessed them, they were overtaken by destruction. <i>Nṛga, Śibi Auśīnara</i>, <i>Bhagīratha, Vasumanas, Gaya, Pūru</i>, and <i>Purūravas</i> had by practising ascetic penances and visiting <i>tīrthas</i>, etc., obtained fame and wealth, etc., and so would <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and as <i>Ikṣvāku</i> with his sons, etc., and <i>Mucukunda, Māndhātṛ</i>, and <i>Marutta</i>, and the gods and <i>devarṣis</i> obtained fame by the power of asceticism, so would <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, while the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, enslaved by sinfulness and ignorance, soon would be exterminated (III, <b>94</b>).—§ 379: The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with their followers, proceeding from place to place, at last arrived at <i>Naimiṣa</i>, and thence to the <i>Gomatī</i>, etc. (enumeration of <i>tīrthas</i> visited).—§ 380: <i>Brahmasaras</i> (q.v.).— § 381: <i>Gaya</i> (q.v.).—§ 382: Thence they came to the hermitage of <i>Agastya</i>, and dwelt in <i>Durjayā</i> (i.e. <i>Maṇimatī</i>, the city of <i>Vātāpi</i>, Nīl.); there asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> <i>Lomaśa</i> told: <i>Agastyopākhyāna</i> (q.v.).—§ 383: Description of the <i>Gaṅgā (b</i>). Then, having at the suggestion of <i>Lomaśa</i>, with his brothers and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, bathed in <i>Bhṛgos</i> <i>tīrthaṃ (c</i>) and gratified the gods and <i>Pitṛs, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> blazed forth in brighter effulgence and became invincible. At his request <i>Lomaśa</i> told <i>Jāmadagnyatejohānikathana (b</i>) (v. <i>Rāma<sup>1</sup></i>).—§ 384: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to hear the details of <i>Agastya. Lomaśa</i> related: <i>Agastyopākhyāna</i> (q.v.).— § 385: At the request of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira Lomaśa</i> related how <i>Agastya</i> had caused <i>Vindhya</i> (q.v.) to cease to increase (§ 385), how <i>Agastya</i> drank up the Ocean (§ 386, cf. Agastyopākhyāna), <i>Sagara</i> (§ 387), <i>Asamañjas</i> (§ 388), <i>Gaṅgāvataraṇa</i> (§ 389).—§ 390: Then <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> proceeded to the rivers <i>Nandā</i> and <i>Aparanandā</i> and the <i>Hemakūṭa</i> (<i>b</i>, cf. <i>Ṛṣabhakūṭa</i>) mountain. Having, at the command of <i>Lomaśa</i>, bathed in <i>Nandā</i>, they proceeded to the river <i>Kauśikī</i> (<i>c</i>) with the hermitages of <i>Viśvāmitra</i> and of <i>Kāśyapa</i>, the father of <i>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga (d</i>).—§ 391: At the request of <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira Lomaśa</i> told the history of <i>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga</i> (q.v.)—§ 392: Starting from <i>Kauśikī, Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in succession repaired to all the sacred shrines (<i>āyatanāni</i>) and came to the sea where the <i>Gaṅgā</i> falls into it, and bathed in the centre of 500 rivers. Then they proceeded by the shore of the sea towards the <i>Kaliṅga</i> country. <i>Lomaśa</i> said: “Here is the river <i>Vaitaraṇī (b</i>).” When they had all bathed in the <i>Vaitaraṇī</i>, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> felt as if he were carried off from the region of men, and beheld all worlds, and heard the reciting of <i>Vaikhānasas</i>, whom <i>Lomaśa</i> declared to be at the distance of 300,000 <i>yojanas. Lomaśa</i> ordered him to be silent, as this was the divine forest of <i>Svayambhū (Svayambhuvo vanaṃ) (c</i>); taught by <i>Lomaśa</i> the words to be recited (<i>Oṃ namo viśva-</i> <i>guptāya</i>, etc. [α]) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> mounted the altar of <i>Kaśyapa</i> and bathed in the sea; then he went to the <i>Mahendra</i> mountain and spent the night there (III, <b>114</b>).—§ 393: <i>Lomaśa</i> told <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> the names of the ascetics (<i>Bhṛgus</i>, <i>Aṅgirases, Vāsiṣṭhas, Kāśyapas</i>), and he, with his brothers, paid a visit to them. <i>Akṛtavraṇa</i>, a follower of <i>Rāma</i> <i>Jāmadagnya</i>, told him when <i>Paraśu-Rāma</i> (q.v.) appeared, and that the following day was the 14th.—§ 394: At the request of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Akṛtavraṇa (b</i>) related the story of <i>Arjuna Kārtavīrya</i> (q.v.), and <i>Jamadagni</i> (q.v.), and <i>Paraśurāma</i> (q.v.) (§§ 394—8)—§ 399: <i>Mahendrācala-gamana</i> (q.v.).—§ 400: On their journey to the <i>tīrthas</i> they bathed in a holy stream, and thence reached to <i>Godāvarī</i> and to the sea (in the <i>Draviḍa</i> country); then to <i>Agastyatīrtha</i> and the <i>Nārī-</i> <i>tīrthas</i>, where they heard of and praised the deed of <i>Arjuna</i>, and gave away thousands of cows, and by and by they reached <i>Śūrpāraka</i> (C. <i>Sūrp°</i>), where they saw the altar of <i>Ṛcīka's</i> son surrounded by crowds of ascetics, and the shrines of the <i>Vasus</i>, of the hosts of the <i>Maruts</i>, of the <i>Aśvins</i>, <i>Vaivasvata, Āditya, Dhaneśvara, Indra, Viṣṇu, Savitṛ, Bhava</i>, <i>Candra, Divākara</i>, and of the lord of waters, and of the host of <i>Sādhyas</i>, of <i>Dhātṛ</i>, of the <i>Pitṛs</i>, of <i>Rudra</i> with his host, of <i>Sarasvatī</i>, of the host of <i>Siddhas</i>, etc., and then returned to <i>Śūrpāraka</i>, and from this <i>tīrtha</i> at the sea they came to <i>Prabhāsa</i>, where they offered libations to the <i>Pitṛs</i> and gods, and where <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> practised austerities for twelve days, subsisting upon air and water, and performing ablutions day and night, surrounded by fires kindled on all sides. There came to them <i>Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa, Śāmba</i>, etc., <i>Kārṣṇi</i>, the grandson of <i>Śini</i>, and other <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, and heard what had happened to them, and wept when they saw the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> so exceedingly lean (III, <b>118</b>).—§ 401: <i>Bala-Rāma</i> (q.v.).— § 402: <i>Sātyaki</i>, citing <i>Śaibya</i>, etc., who did the work for <i>Yayāti</i>, recommended that <i>Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, Pradyumna</i>, <i>Śāmba (b</i>), himself, <i>Aniruddha, Gada, Ulmuka, Bāhuka, Bhānu</i>, <i>Nītha</i>, the young hero <i>Niśatha, Sāraṇa</i>, and <i>Cārudeṣṇa</i> should lead the united army of the <i>Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas</i>, <i>Andhakas, Sāttvatas</i>, and <i>Śūras</i> (C. <i>Sū°</i>) against the <i>Dhārta-</i> <i>rāṣṭras</i> and kill them in battle, and that <i>Abhimanyu</i> should rule the earth until <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had fulfilled his vow. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> would never accept the sovereignty unless it were won by their own prowess, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> assented to the words of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, saying, that as <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> alone knew him, so he alone knew <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who would perceive when the time had come for bravery, and he and <i>Sātyaki</i> would then defeat <i>Suyodhana</i>. Then the <i>Yadus</i> returned home, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> continued their journey accompanied by <i>Lomaśa</i>, and came to the river <i>Payoṣṇī (c</i>).— § 403: <i>Lomaśa</i> spoke of sacrifices that had formerly been performed at the <i>Payoṣṇī (b</i>); he who bathed in the <i>Payoṣṇī</i> would obtain the same <i>lokas</i> as <i>Gaya</i>.—§ 404: Having bathed in the <i>Payoṣṇī</i> they went to <i>Vaidūryaparvata</i> and <i>Narmadā</i>, where they, according to the exposition of <i>Lomaśa</i>, visited all the <i>tīrthas</i> and shrines, giving gifts to the brahmans by thousands. <i>Lomaśa</i> said that this was the junction between the <i>Tretā</i> and <i>Dvāpara</i> age, where a person is freed of all his sins, and that here was performed the sacrifice of <i>Śaryāti (b), Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to hear more about it (III, <b>121</b>).—§ 405: <i>Sukanyopākhyāna</i> (q.v.).—§ 406: <i>Lomaśa</i> recommended to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to visit the abovenamed lake, and <i>Sikatākṣa</i>, and the <i>Saindhava</i> wood, and <i>Puṣkara</i> (reciting the hymns of <i>Sthāṇu</i>, this being the junction of the <i>Dvāpara</i> and <i>Tretā</i>, etc.), and <i>Ārcīkaparvata (b</i>). Here the ṛṣis eat rice boiled in milk. Here(?) is the <i>Yamunā</i>, where Kṛṣṇa performed austerities; there is the holy spring of Indra, where <i>Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ</i>, and <i>Varuṇa</i> rose upwards. In the <i>Yamunā Māndhātṛ</i> and <i>Somaka Sāhadevi</i> performed sacrifices (III, <b>125</b>).—§ 407: <i>Māndhātrupā-</i> <i>khyāna</i> (q.v.).—§ 408: <i>Jantūpākhyāna</i> (q.v.).—§§ 409—10: <i>Plakṣāvataraṇa-gamana</i> (q.v.).—§ 411: <i>Śyenakapotīya</i> (q.v.). —§ 412: When they arrived at the hermitage of <i>Śvetaketu (b</i>) (who, with his sister's son <i>Aṣṭāvakra</i>, was the best in that <i>yuga</i> of those conversant with the sacred lore (<i>brahmakṛtāṃ</i>), where <i>Śvetaketu</i> beheld the goddess <i>Sarasvatī</i> in her human shape and spoke unto her, “may I be endowed with the gift of speech,” <i>Lomaśa</i> related: <i>Aṣṭāvakrīya</i> (q.v.).—§ 413: <i>Lomaśa</i> pointed out to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira Samaṅgā</i> [or] <i>Madhuvilā</i>, where <i>Indra</i>, after the slaughter of <i>Vṛtra</i>, became purified from all sins, <i>Kardamila, Maināka</i> (cf. <i>Aditi</i>), the <i>Kanakhala</i> mountains, <i>Gaṅgā</i>, the lake <i>Puṇya</i>, the mountain <i>Bhṛgutuṅga</i>, <i>Uṣṇīgaṅga</i> (PCR. <i>Tu°</i>), the hermitage of <i>Sthālaśiras</i>, and that of <i>Raibhya (b</i>).—§ 414: Questioned by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, <i>Lomaśa</i> related the <i>Yavakrītopākhyāna</i> (q.v.).—§ 418: They had soon passed the mountains <i>Uśīrabīja, Maināka, Śveta</i>, and <i>Kālaśaila</i>, and saw the seven-fold <i>Gaṅgā (b</i>). Here was the playground of the gods marked with their footprints (<i>caraṇāṅkitaṃ</i>). Now they should proceed to the mountains <i>Kālaśaila, Śveta</i>, and <i>Mandara (c</i>); protected by <i>Kubera</i>, etc., and by <i>Yātudhānas</i>, these mountains are difficult to ascend. There are also other followers of <i>Kubera</i>, cruel and friendly (<i>raudrā maitrāś ca) Rākṣasas</i>. Description of <i>Kailāsa (d</i>). <i>Lomaśa</i> asked <i>Varuṇa, Yama, Gaṅgā</i> (“the daughter of the mountain”, v. 10836), <i>Yamunā</i>, the mountain, the <i>Maruts</i>, the <i>Aśvins</i>, the rivers to vouchsafe <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> safety from gods, <i>Asuras</i>, and <i>Vasus</i>, and the mountains. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> recommended them all to practise here the utmost cleanliness, and asked <i>Bhīma</i> to protect <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, who, in times of danger, even if <i>Arjuna</i> were present, ever sought protection from <i>Bhīma</i> (III, <b>139</b>).—§§ 419—23: <i>Gandhamādana-praveśa</i> (q.v.). —§ 424: <i>Bhīma-kadalī-khaṇḍa-praveśa</i> (q.v.).—§§ 425—6: <i>Hanūmad-Bhīma-saṃvāda</i> (q.v.).—§ 427: <i>Tretā-yuga</i> (q.v.). —§ 428: <i>Dvāpara-yuga</i> (q.v.).—§ 429: <i>Kuli-yuga</i> (q.v.).— § 430: <i>Hanūmad-Bhīma-saṃvāda</i> (q.v.).—§§ 431—4: <i>Saugandhikāharaṇa</i> (q.v.)."
