The <i>Pāriṣadas</i> of <i>Skanda</i>: When <i>Skanda</i> was struck with the thunderbolt, a number of male children were produced, who steal little children, whether born or in the womb, as also a number of female children. They adopted <i>Viśākha</i> as their father. <i>Bhadra-</i> <i>śākha</i> (form of <i>Skanda</i>, cf. v. 14400), with a face like that of a goat, in the battle protected his sons and daughters, in the presence of the mothers. Therefore they call <i>Skanda</i> <i>Kumārapitṛ</i> (so B., C. has <i>Kumāraṃ pitaraṃ</i>), and those who desire to have sons worship <i>Rudra</i> as <i>Agni</i>, and <i>Umā</i> as <i>Svāhā</i> (so C., B. has <i>Agnimukhāṃ</i> instead of <i>Agnim Umāṃ</i>). The daughters of the <i>Tapa</i> fire obtained from <i>Skanda</i> that they became the mothers of the whole world; some of them should be good (<i>śivāḥ</i>) and some evil (<i>aśivāḥ</i>). Having adopted <i>Skanda</i> as their son, the host of the mothers departed. <i>Kākī, Halimā</i>, etc. (in all seven) (α) had, by the grace of <i>Skanda</i>, a terrible son <i>Śiśu</i>, who is named <i>vīrāṣṭaka</i> (i.e. consisting of eight men) or, when the goat's head is included, <i>navaka</i> (i.e. consisting of nine). The sixth face of <i>Skanda</i> is that of a goat, the best of the six, honoured by the mothers, that by which <i>Bhadraśākha</i> created the divine energy (<i>?śaktiṃ</i> <i>yenāsṛjad divyāṃ</i>). This happened on the fifth day of the bright half of the mouth, and on the sixth a terrific battle took place (III, <b>228</b>).—§ 501. Description of <i>Skanda. Śrī</i>, embodied and looking like a lotus, rendered her allegiance to him. The <i>brahmans</i> and <i>maharṣis</i> praised him, saying: “<i>Hiraṇyagarbha!</i> thou who wast born only six nights ago, do thou become <i>Indra</i>,” and at his request they explained to him the offices of <i>Indra (b</i>). Even <i>Indra</i> besought him to become the lord of the gods. But, at the request of <i>Skanda</i>, <i>Indra</i> retained his sovereignty, and, with all the gods, anointed <i>Skanda</i> as the leader of the celestial forces, and fastened the celestial wreath of gold, of <i>Viśvakarman's</i> manu— facture, round his neck. <i>Rudra</i> came with <i>Pārvatī</i> and honoured him. <i>Skanda</i> is called the son of <i>Rudra</i> because <i>Agni</i> is called <i>Rudra</i> by <i>brahmans</i>, and because he was produced by <i>Rudra</i> entering Fire, and because he was honoured by <i>Rudra</i> before all the gods, and because the <i>Śveta</i> mountain, where he was reared by the <i>Kṛttikās</i>, was formed of <i>Rudra's</i> semen virile. The red cock, given him by <i>Agni</i>, formed the ensign of <i>Skanda</i>, perched on the top of his chariot. The power (<i>śakti</i>) which conduces to the victory of the gods, advanced before him. An innate armour entered into his body, and always manifests itself on the battle-field. Under the recitation of holy texts he was honoured by D., G., Aps., Pś., etc. Then he married <i>Devasenā</i> (names v. 14451), Bṛh. performing the necessary prayers and oblations. Then <i>Lakṣmī</i> began to serve him. Therefore the fifth lunar day is called <i>Śrī-pañcamī</i>, and the sixth “a great tithi” (<i>mahā-</i> <i>tithiḥ</i>) (III, <b>229</b>)"
