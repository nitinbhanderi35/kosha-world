There is the following story in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, about the way in which these two sages came to be associated with King Janamejaya. <dvsn n='NI'/>Janamejaya, son of Parīkṣit, along with his brothers performed an elaborate Yāga at Kurukṣetra. His three brothers were Śrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena. While they were performing the Yāga, a dog which was the son of Saramā came there. Janamejaya's brothers attacked the dog without any provocation. Saramā became angry and she cursed Janamejaya. The curse frightened him. After the Yāga he reached Hastināpura and went out in search of a priest who would be able to liberate him from the curse. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once, as he was returning from a hunt, he happened to come across an āśrama within his country. A sage named Śrutaśravas lived there. He had a son named Somaśravas. Janamejaya invited Somaśravas to be his priest. At that time Śrutaśravas said to him:- “This my son was born to a serpent-woman and he is endowed with the power of my austerity. He is capable of releasing you from all sins except “Mahādevakṛtyā”. If a Brāhmaṇa prays to him for anything, the prayer would be fulfilled. If you can set it right, you may take him with you.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Janamejaya agreed and took Śomaśravas with him to the palace. He made him priest and completed the Yāga. Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 58 states that Śrutaśravas was also a member of Janamejaya's Yāga. He was among the sages who attained Siddhi (superhuman powers) by performing tapas. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 292, Verse 16)."
