Budha was born to Candra, Purūravas to Budha, Āyus to Purāravas, Nahuṣa to Āyus, Yayāti to Nahuṣa and Yadu to Yayāti. Yadu had five sons, the eldest of whom was known by the name Sahasrajit. The rest of them were known as Nīlāñjika, Raghu, Kroṣṭu and Śatajit. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sahasrajit had three sons called Śatajit, Haihaya and Reṇuhaya. Dharmanetra was born to Haihaya, Sahana to Dharmanetra, Mahimān to Sahana, Bhadrasena to Mahimān, Durgama to Bhadrasena and Kanaka to Durgama. From Kanaka were born the four sons Kṛtavīrya, Kṛtāgni, Karavīra and Kṛtaujas. Arjuna (Kārttavīryārjuna) was born as the son of Kṛtavīrya. <dvsn n='NI'/>Arjuna renowned as Kārttavīrya became the supreme lord of the earth comprising the Saptadvīpa (Seven Islands) by the merits of his penance. He got invincibility and thousand hands in battles, as boons. He performed ten thousand sacrifices all in conformity with the rules and regulations. To escape from loss of wealth one had only to remember his name. It was ordered that Kings other than Kārttavīrya, however great the extent of their might and prowess, and the number of sacrifices, offering of alms and penance done be, would not stand on a par with him. <dvsn n='NI'/>Kārttavīrya had a hundred sons, of whom the most famous were Śūrasena, Śūra, Dhṛṣṭa, Kṛṣṇa, and Jayadhvaja. Jayadhvaja the most renowned of these five ruled in Avanti as King. Tālajaṅgha who had several sons, was born from Jayadhvaja. The family of the Haihayas was split into five. They were the Bhojas, the Avanti family, the Vītihotra family, the Svayaṃjātā family and the Śauṇḍikeya family. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 275)"
