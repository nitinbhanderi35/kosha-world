Two sons named Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa and a daughter named Siṃhikā were born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Diti. Siṃhikā was married by Vipracitti. Two sons named Rāhu and Ketu were born to them. Because they were the sons of Siṃhikā, they came to be known by the name Saiṃhikeyas. <dvsn n='NI'/>(But it is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, that Siṃhikā was the daughter of Prajāpati Dakṣa and the wife of Kaśyapa.) <dvsn n='NI'/>A story occurs in Rāmāyaṇa, that this Siṃhikā caught hold of Hanūmān by his shadow and swallowed him, while he was jumping to Laṅkā, and that Hanūmān escaped from her. (See under Rāma, para 27)."
