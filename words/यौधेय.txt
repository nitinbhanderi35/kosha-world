            "content": "23. <i>Yaudheya</i>¦ (No. 1, L. 22): The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied northern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.<sup>581</sup> Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)<sup>582</sup> which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijayagadh Inscription<sup>583</sup> which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)<sup>584</sup> connects them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.<sup>585</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Literally the word <i>Yaudheya</i> means ‘a warrior’ which corresponds with the <i>Ossadü</i> of Arrian, the <i>Sambastae</i> of Diodorus and the <i>Sambracae</i> of Curtius, who made their submission to Alexander.<sup>586</sup> They were a powerful nation and their forces consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.<sup>587</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>We get three different versions about the origin of the Yaudheyas: <dvsn n='HI'/>(i) In the Mahābhārata<sup>588</sup> it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana named Devikā and begot a son from her named Yaudheya. Buddha Prakash<sup>589</sup> and M.K. Sharan,<sup>590</sup> on this basis, have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K. Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a positive evidence;<sup>591</sup> but on the other hand he himself has indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic hero Arjuna.<sup>592</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same story. It states that <i>Yaudheyī</i> was the queen of Yudhiṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka<sup>593</sup> <dvsn n='HI'/>(iii) The Harivaṃśa<sup>594</sup> and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>595</sup> state that King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣadvatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga), Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively. Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Ambaṣṭhapurī.<sup>596</sup> According to Pargiter, King Uśinara established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.<sup>597</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition without any further evidence. However, as regards their connection with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the territory ruled over by him.<sup>598</sup> The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley, a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsaritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near the source of Ganges at Kanakhala. <dvsn n='P'/>It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the Akesines (Chenab).<sup>599</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Mahābhārata,<sup>600</sup> the Yaudheyas are described as having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,<sup>601</sup> the Yaudheyas together with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,<sup>602</sup> we find that an epithet <i>‘Adrija’</i> meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for the Yaudheyas. <dvsn n='P'/>The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the Punjab. Pāṇini<sup>603</sup> includes them among the <i>āyudhajīvī saṃghas</i> together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians by Dr. Buddha Prakash.<sup>604</sup> Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in another Sūtra also.<sup>605</sup> Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as a warrior clan of the Punjab.<sup>606</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>607</sup> places them in the northern division of India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.<sup>608</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as interested in gambling (<i>dīvyatām</i>) and speaking the Southern Vaidarbhī.<sup>609</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak where there seems to have existed a regular mint.<sup>610</sup> Their new currency<sup>611</sup> depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule in India.<sup>612</sup> The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large number at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th century A.D.<sup>613</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>One of their seals, bearing the legend <i>“Yaudheyānām jayam-</i> <i>antradharāṇām”</i><sup>614</sup> shows that they were held in high esteem among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji<sup>615</sup> opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan<sup>616</sup> explains the word <i>“Mantradhara”</i> to mean the members of the Executive Committee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the name of the <i>“Mantradharas”</i> and the <i>“Gaṇa”,</i> while the other set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.<sup>617</sup> He seems to have wrongly substituted the reading <i>“Mantradhāra”</i> for <i>“Mantra-</i> <i>dhara”.</i> He has been arbitrary in separating <i>“Jaya”</i> from <i>Mantradharāṇām</i>”<sup>618</sup> which forms a compound by the combination of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some historians who consider the word <i>“Mantradharāṇām”</i> to mean ‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal<sup>619</sup> found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as they had adopted the title of ‘जयमन्त्रधराः’”. <dvsn n='P'/>Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and pride that they never got defeated. <dvsn n='P'/>Another word which has raised some controversy among the scholars is <i>“Darma”</i> found on some of the Yaudheya coins. Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for <i>‘Dama’</i> or <i>‘Darma’</i> to be a Sanskritised form of Greek — <i>“Drachma”.</i><sup>620</sup> Again some controversy arose whether it was a Copper one or of silver.<sup>621</sup> The word <i>‘Damma’</i> or <i>‘Dramma’</i> has been used for a gold coin.<sup>622</sup> It may be remarked that the word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean coin.<sup>623</sup> The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker economic condition; surely they could not compare with powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have the mysterious words, <i>“dvi”</i> (two) and <i>“tri”</i> (three) after the legend <i>“Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ”</i> which may point out their making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas and the Kuṇindas.<sup>624</sup> They seem to have controlled the area lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word <i>‘Johiya’</i> is apparently an abbreviation of <i>‘Jodhiya’,</i> which is the Sanskrit Yaudheya.<sup>625</sup> Cunningham, however, takes the words <i>‘dvi’</i> and <i>‘tri’</i> of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.<sup>626</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>M.K. Sharan<sup>627</sup> has enlisted about twenty-four types and Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their social life. They are as follows: <dvsn n='P'/>1. Bull <dvsn n='P'/>2. Elephant <dvsn n='P'/>3. Deer <dvsn n='P'/>4. Peacock <dvsn n='P'/>5. Tree-in-railing <dvsn n='P'/>6.

Two <i>‘s’</i> with a line in between probably representing two hooded snakes <dvsn n='P'/>18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yūpa <dvsn n='P'/>19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river <dvsn n='P'/>20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun <dvsn n='HI'/>21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation of the Yūpa <dvsn n='P'/>22. Hill so-called Caitya <dvsn n='P'/>23. Six-headed Ṣaṣṭhī or Kṛttikā<sup>628</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>24. Śiva."
