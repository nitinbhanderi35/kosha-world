I. H. Ms. of it, in both actual editions of the Mitākṣara and in the E. I. H. Mss. of this work in the same sense, it may be as well to observe that the meaning intended by the former part of the compound could not be expressed by the word अन्नाकाल but, if अन्न were to make part of it, would require a form अनन्नकाल; अनाकाल, however, similar in structure to अनावृष्टि, is a correct formation implying ‘hard time in general i. e. time of distress, famine &c.’.]"
