So he persuaded them to worship cows, Brāhmaṇas and hills. So it happened. Indra who was thus deprived of his <i>bali</i> grew wrathful and sent down a continuous heavy downpour of rain creating panic in the minds of gopas. Kṛṣṇa took hold of the hill Govardhana and held it aloft as an umbrella steadily for seven days. Astonished at this, Indra withdrew his rains and Govardhana was planted in its place. <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. X. 24 (whole); ch. 25. 1-28."
