Because Pañcakarṇa was born in the family of Vātsya he got the name Vātsyāyana. <dvsn n='NI'/>In the language of Yogic treatises the seven life-winds in the human head are called the ‘Saptasūryas’ (seven suns). Pañcakarṇavātsyāyana had a clear knowledge of these Saptasūryas and has given a vivid description of them. (Taittirīya Āraṇyaka)."
