Ṛbhu conveyed all knowledge to Nidāgha. But he saw that although he taught Nidāgha all branches of knowledge, the latter did not take any interest in “Advaita”. So he left him in disappointment but later got him interested in Advaita. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2. Chapters 15-16)."

Its calf began to cry. The Ṛṣi took pity on it and prayed to the Ṛbhus. They made a cow and covered it with the skin of the dead cow and placed it in front of the calf. Because of its likeness to its mother, the calf believed it to be its mother. <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Ṛbhus restored their parents who had become old, to youth. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka. 11th Sūkta). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Ṛgveda says that it was the Ṛbhus who made Indra's horses, the chariot of the Aśvinīs and Bṛhaspati's cow."
