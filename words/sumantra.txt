Arthasādhaka, Aśoka, Mantrapāla and Sumantra and two priests called Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 7). Sumantra was the right-hand-man of Dasaratha in all his activities. It was Sumantra who brought down to the palace sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga for the yajña conducted by the king to have issues. According to chapter 12, Virāṭa Parva of Mahābhārata (Southern Text) Sumantra was Daśaratha's charioteer as well."
