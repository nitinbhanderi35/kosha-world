One day while Vidūratha was hunting in the forest, he saw a cleavage on the earth caused by the yawning of Kujṛmbhāsura. The king stood there for a while looking at the cleavage. Then the hermit Suvrata who had been standing close by approached the king and said. “This asura Kujṛmbha has a divine pestle with him. Because of the possession of this pestle he has become invincible and is a threat to the whole world.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Vidūratha, who knew everything from Suvrata, lived cautiously. One day his daughter was carried away by this Kujṛmbhāsura. Sunīti and Sumati confronted the asura to rescue their sister but were made captives. Finally Vatsapri, the son of the hermit Bhalanda killed the Rākṣasa (giant) and liberated princess Mudāvatī. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Chapter 113)."
