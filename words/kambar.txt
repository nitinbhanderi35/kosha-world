            "content": "KAMBAR¦. A celebrated Tamil poet. He was born in a poor family. At the orders of the King many poets wrote the story of Rāmāyaṇa in Tamil. But Kambar's work was accepted as the best. This is the renowned Kamba Rāmāyaṇa. Kambar has written many other poems of which the important ones are Sarasvatī Antādi and Kāñcī Purāṇa. It is said that unintelligent children of Tamil nādu are even now given sand from the burial ground of Kambar to induce intelligence into them. The (—r) suffix in Kambar is plural denoting respect. (See under ‘Bhadrakālī’)."
