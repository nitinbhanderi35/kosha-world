            "content": "KṚTAVARMĀ¦. A King of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty. In the previous generation of Vṛṣṇi also a Kṛtavarman is noticed. The genealogy of both is given below. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Genealogy.</i> Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa— Yayāti—Yadu—Sahasrajit—Śatajit—Hehaya—Dharma Kunti—Sadājit—Dhanaka. <dvsn n='NI'/>Dhanaka had four sons called Kṛtavīrya, Kṛtāgni, Kṛtavarman and Kṛtaujas, and one of the four was the first Kṛtavarman. <dvsn n='NI'/>The dynasty continues again from Kṛtavīrya—KṛtavīryaKārtavīryārjuna—Madhu—Vṛṣṇi—Yudhājit— Śini—Satyaka—Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna)—Jaya—Kaṇi— Anamitra—Pṛśni—Citraratha—Viḍūratha—Śūra—Śini -Bhoja—Hṛdīka—Kṛtavarman. <dvsn n='NI'/>Hṛdīka had four sons, viz. Devavāha, Gadādhanvan, Kṛtavarman and Śūra. And, Sūra begot of his wife, Māriṣā ten sons, i.e. Vasu, Devabhāga, Devaśravas, Ānaka, Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka, Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kavūka and Vasudeva. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Vasudeva. The Kṛtavarman referred to below was the brother of Kṛṣṇa's grand-father. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Kṛtavarman and Syamantaka.</i> King Satrājit had in his possession the famous gem called Syamantaka. The King's brother Prasena, went for hunting with this jewel on him. A lion killed Prasena, and Jāmbavān killed the lion and got the gem. A scandal was circulated to the effect that Śrī Kṛṣṇa had stolen the gem. But, Kṛṣṇa got back the gem from Jāmbavān and handed it over to Satrājit, who in turn, gave his daughter Satyabhāmā in marriage to Kṛṣṇa. Though Satrājit wanted to give the gem—Syamantaka—to Kṛṣṇa as dowry, the latter did not accept it. <dvsn n='NI'/>Akrūra and Kṛtavarman were bosom friends, and they incited another Yādava King Śatadhanvā, to grab the Syamantaka. Śatadhanvā killed Satrājit and took possession of the gem. Hearing about this murder Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma set out to kill Śatadhanvā, who, in great alarm, started for north after entrusting the gem to Akrūra and Kṛtavarman. His horse died at Mithilāpurī and he began running. Balabhadra and Kṛṣṇa ran after him, caught and killed him. But, they did not get the Syamantaka. <dvsn n='NI'/>Now Akrūra and Kṛtavarman began their penance at Kāśī. Seven years passed thus when famine broke out in Dvārakā. When once upon a time famine stalked Kāśī the king had brought Śvaphalka, father of Akrūra, over to Kāśī, and there was no more famine in the country. Therefore, when famine broke out in Dvārakā the Yadavas thought the presence of Śvaphalka's son, Akrūra would dispel the famine. Accordingly Akrūra was recalled to Dvārakā, and along with him returned Kṛtavarman also. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra decided that Syamantaka should be kept by Akrūra himself. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Other information relating to Kṛtavarman.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) He was a very famous archer.
