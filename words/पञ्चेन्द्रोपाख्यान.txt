Vaivāhikap.): <i>Vyāsa</i> said to <i>Drupada</i>: In days of yore, when the gods were celebrating a great sacrifice in the forest of <i>Naimiṣa, Yama</i>, holding the office of <i>śamitṛ</i>, did not slay the creatures, so that their numbers increased very greatly. <i>Soma, Śakra, Varuṇa</i>, <i>Kubera</i>, the <i>Sādhyas</i>, the <i>Rudras</i>, the <i>Vasus</i>, the <i>Aśvins</i>, etc., complained thereof to <i>Prajāpati</i>, who comforted them, saying that when the sacrifice was over <i>Yama</i> would again sweep away the inhabitants of the earth. The gods then returned to the place of the sacrifice, and saw a golden lotus carried along the <i>Bhāgīrathī. Indra</i> proceeded to the spot where the <i>Gaṅgā</i> issues, and saw a beautiful woman (it was <i>Śrī</i>), whose tears were being transformed into golden lotuses. She led him to <i>Mahādeva</i>, who as a handsome youth was seated with a young lady on a throne on one of the peaks of the <i>Himavat</i>, playing dice. When <i>Indra</i> spoke haughtily of himself, <i>Mahadeva</i> caused <i>Śrī</i> to paralyse him and lead him into a hole, where four <i>Indras</i> of old were confined in order to be reborn in the world of men, there to slay a large number of men, and then to regain the region of <i>Indra</i>. Their fathers should be <i>Dharma</i>, <i>Vāyu, Maghavat</i>, and the <i>Aśvins, Indra</i> creating a person from himself to be the fifth among them. Their names were <i>Viśvabhuj, Bhūtadhāman, Śibi, Śānti</i>, and <i>Tejasvin</i>. The weeping woman (<i>Śrī</i>) was appointed to be their common wife in the world of men. <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, to whom <i>Īśāna</i> (i.e. <i>Śiva</i>) and the five <i>Indras</i> repaired, approved of everything. The five <i>Indras</i> were reborn as the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and <i>Śrī</i> as <i>Draupadī</i>. A white hair of <i>Nārāyaṇa's</i> became <i>Bala-</i> <i>deva</i>, and a black <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, after having entered the wombs of <i>Devakī</i> and <i>Rohiṇī</i>. Having related this to <i>Drupada, Vyāsa</i> granted him celestial sight, so that he beheld the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> endued with their former bodies.—§ 239: <i>Vyāsa</i> then related to <i>Drupada</i> the story of the damsel (<i>= Śrī = Kṛṣṇā</i>) whom <i>Śaṅkara</i>, i.e. <i>Śiva</i>, appointed to be in a future birth the wife of five husbands (see § 220) (I, <b>197</b>)."
