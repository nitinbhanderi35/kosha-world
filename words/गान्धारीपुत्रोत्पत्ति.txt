She had borne the burden in her womb for two years, when she heard that <i>Kuntī</i> had brought forth a son; she then struck her womb violently, and there came out a hard mass of flesh like an iron ball. When she was about to throw it away, <i>Vyāsa</i> appeared and caused her to put the ball of flesh, sprinkled with cool water and divided into 101 parts (each of the size of a thumb), into 101 pots filled with clarified butter, which were placed in a concealed spot. After having said that she should open the covers of the pots after two years, <i>Vyāsa</i> retired to <i>Himavat</i> in order to devote himself to asceticism. <i>Duryodhana</i> was younger than <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, being born on the same day as <i>Bhīma</i>. As soon as <i>Duryodhana</i> was born he began to cry like an ass, and ill-portending omens appeared. <i>Vidura</i>, etc., in vain told <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> to abandon him. Within a month the 100 sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and one daughter were born. During the pregnancy of <i>Gāndhārī, Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> begot the <i>Karaṇa</i> <i>Yuyutsu</i> upon a maidservant of the <i>Vaiśya</i> class (I, <b>115</b>)."
