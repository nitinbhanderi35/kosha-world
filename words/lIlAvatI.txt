Chapter seven, Brahmakhaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa contains the following story. <dvsn n='NI'/>In times of old in Kṛtayuga there was a beautiful prostitute of the name Līlāvatī. Once she went away from her own town to another in search of better prospects. There she saw a big assemblage of people in a temple. They were observing Rādhāṣṭamīvrata and worshipping their deity with scented flowers and incense of sweet fragrance. Some were reciting prayers, some were singing and yet others were dancing. The whole atmosphere was filled with devotion. Līlāvatī went to them and enquired about it. They told her that that day was the birthday of Rādhādevī, the Śuklāṣṭamī of the month of Proṣṭhapada, and if anyone observed Vrata on that day worshipping Rādhādevī he would be absolved of all sins. <dvsn n='NI'/>On hearing that, Līlāvati decided to observe the Vrata. She joined the devotees of the temple and observed the Vrata with great devotion. Soon she died of snake-bite and the servants of Yama came to take her soul to hell because of the sins she had committed as a prostitute. But before the Yamadūtas could touch her, Pārṣadas of Mahāviṣṇu wearing the insignia of Śaṅkha, Cakra, Gadā and Padma came to her with a chariot drawn by kingly swans and took her to heaven."
