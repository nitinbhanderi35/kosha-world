When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went with his retinue of Yādavas to visit the holy palace called Piṇḍāraka the Yādavas conducted a wine festival. During that festival a demon of the name Nikumbha carried away Bhānumatī. This was because of a curse to Bhānumatī from Durvāsas whom Bhānumatī did not respect once when they met at the garden of Raivata. Durvāsas had after the curse consoled her by assuring her that she would be saved and married by Sahadeva, one of the Pāṇḍavas. True to this, Bhānumatī was married to Sahadeva in the presence of Nārada and Kṛṣṇa. (Viṣṇu Parva, Chapter 90)."
