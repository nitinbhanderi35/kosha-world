He used to think deeply before doing any deed and so he earned the name Cirakārī. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once the sage Gautama found out proof against the chastity of his own wife and enraged at this commanded his son Cirakārī to chop off the head of the latter's mother. Giving this command Gautama went into the forest and Cirakārī in obedience to his father's order came before his mother, weapon in hand. He did not kill her immediately but pondered over the consequences of the deed. Matricide is a great sin, he mused. Then again who would be there to look after father if mother died. Perhaps his father, when he cools down, might regret his command and come back repentant. Thus he was sitting undecided when Gautama returned full of remorse for his hasty order. On seeing his wife alive he was greatly relieved and immensely happy and he blessed Cirakārī. (Chapter 266, Śānti Parva)."
