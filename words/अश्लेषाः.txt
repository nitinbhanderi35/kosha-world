(description of a <i>cāndra vrata</i> or religious performance with reference to the moon in the month Mārgaśīrṣa, when the moon is in conjunction with the asterism Mūla; the explanation of Nīlakaṇtha runs thus:—Here is described a <i>cāndra</i> <i>vrata</i> to obtain a desired object; on the 1st day of the bright half of Mārgaśīrṣa, when there is conjunction (of the moon) with the nakṣatra Mūla, one should begin this <i>cāndra vrata</i>; it consists in locating the nakṣatras in the limbs of the moon, Mūla in his feet, etc., i.e., one should think of Mūla together with its deity as being the feet of the moon; in like manner Rohiṇī, etc., with their deities are to be thought of as being his legs, etc.; everywhere the exchanging of the case-endings is a Vedic liberty; Āṣāḍhā, Phālgunī, and Bhādrapadā represent each 2 nakṣatras. The <i>vrata</i> is performed as follows: after one has had pronounced the wish of a lucky day, etc. (<i>puṇyāhavācanādipūrvakaṃ</i>), having taken upon one's self a religious exercise to obtain a desired object, one should fancy the moon and one's self to be one and the same, distribute the nakṣatras together with their respective deities in the limbs of the moon, and day after day propitiate them by the muttering of Veda verses and oblations, etc. (<i>japahomādinā</i>), with the Veda verses required for each of them (<i>tattanmantraiḥ</i>); thus one should go on until the day of the full moon, and when the <i>vrata</i> is at an end, one should present the butter (<i>ghṛta</i>) left from the oblations to the teacher (<i>ācārya</i>); by the words <i>“samāpte</i> <i>tu ghṛtaṃ dadyāt”</i> it is indicated that ghṛta is the substance of the oblation. Thus doing even a cripple becomes wellshaped (<i>sakalāṅgo</i>) at the day of the full moon; this is expressed and exemplified by the sentence beginning with <i>“paripūrṇāṅga.”</i> Aśleṣāḥ (C. Ă°, B. Ā°) is to be identified with the nails). (The chapter is in C. called Aṅgavidhi, in B. Dānadharma.)"
