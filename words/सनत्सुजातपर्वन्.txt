Sānatsujāta). § 560: As <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> wished to hear more, <i>Vidura</i>, as he was born in the <i>Śūdra</i> order, did not venture to say more himself, but he thought of that ancient and eternal <i>Ṛṣi</i> who, leading a life of perpetual celibacy, had said that there is no death. The <i>Ṛṣi</i> came (V, <b>41</b>), was questioned by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and discoursed upon death, the efficacy of religious acts, etc. (V, <b>42—46</b>)."
