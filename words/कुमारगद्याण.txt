See <i>kumāra-gadiāṇaka, komarina-</i> <i>gadyāṇa,</i> etc. Cf. Tamil <i>kumara-kaccāṇam</i> (EI 21), supposed to be a tax payable in coin for the maintenance of the temple of Kumāra or Subrahmaṇya (SITI). But <i>kumāra-gadyāṇa</i> is found in the records of the Gāhaḍavālas of Vārāṇasī, in whose dominions the god in question was not as popular as in the South."
