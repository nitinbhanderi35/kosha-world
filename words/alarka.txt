(Śloka 64, Chapter 115, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.). He was a member of the council of yama. He attained salvation by yoga and meditation. (18th Śloka, Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva, M.B.). <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Alarka decided to overcome the five senses. To control them he sent arrows at the mind, nose, tongue, ear, eye, skin and intelligence. But the senses never surrendered to them. Then Alarka by sheer dhyāna and yoga brought them under control. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 30). <dvsn n='NI'/>Alarka once told a blind brahmin boy to ask for any boon from him. The boy demanded the eyes of Alarka. To keep his promise Alarka scooped out his eyes and gave them to the blind boy. (Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 12, Śloka 43)."
