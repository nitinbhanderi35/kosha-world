Rājādhidevī, queen of Avantī, got three children named Vinda, Anuvinda and Mitravindā. In the Svayaṃvara Mitravindā chose Kṛṣṇa as her husband. Vinda and Anuvinda did not like it and joining the Kaurava side fought against Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa defeated them all and took Mitravindā to Dvārakā. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata)."
