            "content": "SĀVITRĪ I¦. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>General information.</i> The daughter of the Sun. This Sāvitrī is the elder sister of Tapatī. Brahmā married these sisters. It is stated in some Purāṇas that Sāvitrī, Gāyatrī, Sarasvatī all these are one and the same. But there is a story in Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, Chapter 17, stating that Brahmā once went to Gāyatrī in the absence of Sāvitrī, who got angry at this and cursed all the Gods. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Brahmā went to Puṣkara to perform a sacrifice. Śiva, Viṣṇu and all the hermits came there. Everything was ready for the sacrifice according to convention. But Sāvitrī, who had been engaged in household duties had not yet arrived. So a priest was sent to bring her. Sāvitrī said to the priest, “I have not finished dressing. There are so many things to be done here. Moreover, Lakṣmī, Bhavānī, Gaṅgā, Svāhā, Indrāṇī, celestial women, wives of Ṛṣis (hermits), none of these have arrived yet. How can I enter the hall as the only woman?” The priest returned and reported that it was not convenient for Sāvitrī to come just then, as she had so much work to do. Brahmā became angry and said to Indra. “Lord Indra, it is up to you to bring me a wife from wherever you like. But it must be done instantly.” Hearing the order of Brahmā, Indra selected Gāyatrī who was a good-natured damsel of a cowherd's family, and brought her to the sacrificial dais. With the blessings of the hermits and gods, Brahmā held her hand and acknowledged her as his wife. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sāvitrī dressed well, adorned herself with ornaments and reached the sacrificial hall. She saw the marriage scene and became furious. Everybody in the hall held their breath, thinking of the approaching danger. Trembling with anger Sāvitrī said “Lo; Brahmā, how is it that you have committed this sin? Have you not married me with fire as witness? I am your wife. Are you not ashamed of this?” The three godheads shivered with fear. Sāvitrī cursed everybody. The curse given to Brahmā was that no body should worship him on any other day except the month of Kārttika in the year. She cursed Indra that enemies would enter the world of gods and would make Indra their captive. Sāvitrī cried out that Viṣṇu would take the birth of man by the curse of Bhṛgu. She cursed Śiva that he would lose his manliness. She gave Agni the curse that he would eat anything and everything without the discrimination of purity or impurity. She cursed the Brahmins that they would, in future perform sacrifice merely with a view to obtain gifts and that they would be wandering about from temple to temple and from tīrtha to tīrtha merely for gain.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Uttering these words of curse, Sāvitrī left the sacrificial hall. Lakṣmī and some other goddesses followed her a little while. Then they begged for permission to return. Sāvitrī said to them, “Lakṣmī! You are leaving me. Is it not so? Right. Hereafter you shall be permanent nowhere. May you become the companion of the wicked, the wavering, the low-minded, the sinner, the cruel, the foolish etc. Indrāṇī also wants to return. Hear this: Indra will kill Vṛtra and incur the sin of Brahmahatyā and at that time Nahuṣa will capture heaven. Then Nahuṣa will abuse you.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Looking at the celestial women who were going to the sacrificial hall, Sāvitrī said; Look, Ye celestial women. None of you will give birth to child and you will not enjoy the pleasure of nurturing a child.” Saying these words Sāvitrī left the hall. Not knowing what to do, all sat there. Instantly Gāyatrī rose up and looking at everybody, said as a remission of curses: “I shall remit all curses. Those who worship Brahmā, will be blessed with the pleasure of wife and children and wealth and they will unite with Brahmā. Even if Indra is taken captive, he will be made free by his son and will become the king of heaven again. Viṣṇu will rescue his wife and kill the enemy. The phallus will be worshipped in all the worlds. As Brahmins are the gods on earth the gift you take, will be considered your dues. Lakṣmī! you need not worry. Everybody will worship you. He whom you favour will become a well-to-do person and he whom you forsake will become miserable. You Indrāṇī! Because of Nahuṣa's arrogance Agastya will change him to a big python and he will fall to the earth. The celestial maids will have no desire for children. So childlessness will not make you miserable.” By these words of blessings of Gāyatrī, everybody in the sacrificial hall was pacified. <dvsn n='NI'/>2. <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) Sāvitrī shines in the palace of Brahmā. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 34). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Sāvitrī is the sovereign deity of the mantra Gāyatrī. This goddess Sāvitrī rose up from the sacrificial fire of King Aśvapati and gave him a boon, and accordingly a daughter named Sāvitrī was born to the King. This princess was Sāvitrī the wife of Satyavān. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 290). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Śiva, on starting for Tripuradahana (the burning of Tripuras), placed Sāvitrī as the bridles of his horses. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 202, Verse 75). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) Once Jāpaka Brahmin worshipped Devī Sāvitrī, who appeared before him and gave him boons. As the Brahmin was engaged in deep meditation and prayer, he did not see the Devī when she appeared. It was due to this piety that the Brahmin was given boons. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 199). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Once Devī Sāvitrī appeared before Satya, a brahmin of Vidarbha. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 272, Verse 11). <dvsn n='NI'/>(vi) Once Devī Sāvitrī praised the giving of rice as alms. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 8)."

            "content": "SĀVITRĪ IV¦. The wife of Satyavān. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Birth.</i> In the country of Madra, famous in the Purāṇas, there was a king named Aśvapati. His wife was Mālatī. Though the couple grew old they were childless. At last they worshipped Devī Sāvitrī. After vows and prayers for eighteen years the Devī appeared before them, and giving them the boon that a daughter would be born to them, she disappeared. The couple returned to the palace and Mālatī conceived and delivered a daughter whom they named Sāvitrī. (Skandha 9, Devī Bhāgavata; Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 293). <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Marriage.</i> Sāvitrī grew up as though Lakṣmī had taken an incarnation and bloomed into a beautiful damsel. But nobody came forward to marry her. On a New moon day she bathed and purified herself and getting the blessings of Brahmins, came and bowed before her father. The King felt sorry as nobody had offered to marry her though she was in the full bloom of youth. He advised her to travel in the outside world and to select a husband by herself. According to the order of her father she took the aged ministers of the King and travelled through the forests in which hermits lived. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Nārada came to the palace and while he was talking with King Aśvapati, Sāvitrī and the aged ministers returned. She bowed before her father and Nārada. As soon as Nārada saw her, he asked with curiosity about her marriage. The father replied that he had sent her in search of a husband. Sāvitrī said “I have accepted the Prince Satyavān as my husband. He is the son of King Dyumatsena of Sālva. Dyumatsena became blind in his old age, and taking this opportunity his enemies captured his country. Dyumatsena with his wife and son went to the forest and lived there.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Nārada described the qualities of Satyavān. “Satyavān is as radiant as the sun, as intelligent as Bṛhaspati, as valiant as Indra and as patient as the Earth. Aśvapati was immensely pleased at hearing about the good qualities of Satyavān, and asked Nārada, if there was anything to say against him. Nārada said that he had nothing to say against Satyavān except that he would die “within one year from this date.” (Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 294). <dvsn n='NI'/>The King felt miserable when he heard this. Sāvitrī said that she had accepted Satyavān as her husband and that nothing could make her waver from her decision even if he is not going to live more than a year. The King agreed to the wish of his daughter and preparations for the marriage were begun. The King went with Sāvitrī to the forest and saw Dyumatsena who gladly consented to the marriage. Aśvapati returned to the palace leaving Sāvitrī with Satyavān and his parents. As soon as Aśvapati had returned, Sāvitrī discarded her ornaments and assumed the dress suitable to life in the forest and lived with them. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>The death of Satyavān.</i> It was nearly a year and the day of death of Satyavān was fast approaching. There were only four days more. Sāvitrī had taken a vow lasting for three days. Dyumatsena dissuaded her from taking fast. She completed the fast. There was left only one night more. She kept awake for the whole night. Morning came. Though she ended her fast she had not taken any food. Dyumatsena wanted to know the reason. She humbly said that she would eat only after sun-set. <dvsn n='NI'/>As usual Satyavān took his axe and started for the wood. Sāvitrī also followed him. <dvsn n='NI'/>Satyavān:-“You have never accompanied me before. Moreover you are very weak on account of the fast. Then how can you come with me?” <dvsn n='NI'/>Sāvitrī: “I am not at all weak by the fast and vow. I want to come with you. I pray, don't hinder me.” <dvsn n='NI'/>At last Satyavān consented after getting the permission of his parents. Both went to the forest to gather fruits and roots. They gathered fruits and roots. Then Satyavān began to cut wood. By that exertion Satyavān sweated all over. He was affected by headache. “Let me lie down!” He said. The axe fell from his hand. Sāvitrī caught her husband who was falling down and laid him on her lap. Sāvitrī saw a person clad in blood-coloured garments, with red eyes and a rope in hand, coming towards them. He came to the spot and stood there looking at the body of Satyavān. Realizing the person to be Kāla (Deathgod) Sāvitrī stood up instantly and bowed before him. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sāvitrī:—“Who are you Lord. What may be your object in coming here?” <dvsn n='NI'/>Yama:—Hei, Sāvitrī. As you are a hermitess of chastity I may converse with you. I am Yama. I am come to take away the life of your husband.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Sāvitrī:—“Lord, I have heard that your messengers come and take away the souls. How is it that you have come in person today?” <dvsn n='NI'/>Yama:—This Satyavān is a righteous man who is an ocean of good qualities. Messengers are not sent, in the cases of persons like him.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Saying thus Yama cast his rope and caught the soul of Satyavān. Sāvitrī saw the body of her husband lying without life and soul. Sāvitrī followed Yama who had gone to the south with the soul of Satyavān. <dvsn n='NI'/>Yama:—Child, you go back and conduct his funerals. You have followed your husband as far as you can. <dvsn n='NI'/>Sāvitrī:—I am coming to the place where my husband is being taken. That is the duty of a wife. What impediment is there on my way to follow you, when I have the merits of vow, fast, devotion to my elders, love and regard for my husband and the good will of yourself, my Lord.” <dvsn n='NI'/>When Yama realized that it was difficult to send Sāvitrī back, he asked Sāvitrī to ask for any boon. Yama was prepared to give anything except the life of Satyavān. She requested for the recovery of sight by Dyumatsena. Yama granted it. Still Sāvitrī did not turn back. Yama asked her to pray for one more boon. She requested for the recovery of the lost kingdom of Dyumatsena. Yama sanctioned that request also. Still she followed Yama, who was ready to grant her a third boon. She requested: “My father may, please be given a hundred sons who would continue the family. Yama granted that too. But she did not turn back. Yama told her that she might ask for a fourth boon. She said: “I may be given a hundred sons born directly from Satyavān. Yama granted this fourth boon also. Then Sāvitrī asked Yama how the boon would be realized unless the life of Satyavān was given back to him. Yama was pleased with her at her love and devotion for her husband and returned the life of Satyavān. Yama blessed her that she and Satyavān would live for hundred years. <dvsn n='NI'/>Yama disappeared. Sāvitrī returned and sat there taking the body of Satyavān on her lap. Satyavān came to life. Both of them rose up. Night came on. It was dark. They could not find the way. Satyavān wanted to reach their hermitage somehow. Sāvitrī took the axe and supporting her husband in the dim moon light, walked to the hermitage. <dvsn n='NI'/>Dyumatsena got sight. He started with his wife in search of his children, and walked about in the forest. At last all of them met together. They reached home. Then Sāvitrī told them all that had happened. Everyone was delighted. Then some people from Sālva came to the hermitage. They said that the minister had killed the King, that the people had expelled the minister, and that they had come to request Dyumatsena to return to his country and to resume the reign. Accordingly all of them returned to Sālva. Dyumatsena was anointed as the King of Sālva. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 293 to 299)."
