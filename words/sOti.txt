This teacher is responsible for the arrangement of the Mahābhārata. in the form that we see today. <dvsn n='NI'/>The story of Mahābhārata composed by Vyāsa and Vaiśampāyana contained only a graphic description of the battle of Bhārata. No vivid description of Śrī Kṛṣṇa born of the Yādava dynasty and of the Yādavas, was given in it. To remove this deficiency, Sauti added an appendix called ‘Harivaṃśa’ to Svargārohaṇa Parva in Mahābhārata. (For further details see under Bhārata I)."
