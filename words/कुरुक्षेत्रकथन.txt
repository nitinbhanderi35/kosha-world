The R.-ṛ. <i>Kuru</i> had cultivated this field for many years; hence it came to be called <i>Kurukeṣetra</i> (“the field of Kuru”). Requested by <i>Bala-Rāma</i>, the Ṛ. related: In days of yore <i>Kuru</i> was engaged in perseveringly tilling this field; requested by <i>Indra</i>, he said: “Those that will die upon this plain, shall proceed to regions of bliss after being cleansed of their sins.” <i>Śakra</i>, ridiculing this, went back to heaven. This happened repeatedly. <i>Indra</i> summoned the gods, who asked him to stop <i>Kuru</i> by granting him a boon; “if men, by only dying there, were to come to heaven, without having performed sacrifices to us, our very existence would be endangered.” <i>Indra</i> then came, and they agreed that <i>Kuru</i> should not toil any more; but those that would die there, having abstained from food, with all their senses awake, and those that would perish there in battle, should go straight to heaven. It was sanctioned by all the principal gods, headed by <i>Brahmán</i>, that on earth there should be no more sacred spot than this; those men that performed austere penances here would all, after laying down their bodies, go to <i>Brahmán's</i> abode; those who gave away their wealth here would soon have their wealth doubled; those who would reside constantly here would never have to behold the region of <i>Yama</i>; those kings that would perform great sacrifices here would reside as long in heaven as earth would last. <i>Indra</i> had himself composed a verse here and sang it: “The very dust of <i>Kurukṣetra…</i> shall cleanse persons of wicked acts and carry them to heaven.” The principal gods, <i>brahmans</i>, kings as <i>Nṛga</i>, etc., having performed costly sacrifices here, have, after abandoning their bodies, proceeded to heaven. The space between <i>Tarantuka</i> and <i>Arantuka</i> and the lakes of <i>Rāma (Rāmahradānāṃ</i>) and <i>Macakruka</i> (C. <i>°kra°</i>), this <i>Kurukṣetra-Samantapañcaka</i> is called the northern altar of <i>Prajāpati</i>. All that <i>Śakra</i> said was approved by <i>Brahmán, Viṣṇu</i>, and <i>Maheśvara</i> (IX, <b>53</b>)."
