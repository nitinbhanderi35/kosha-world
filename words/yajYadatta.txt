Chapter 6, it is stated that this youth was shot dead with an arrow by Daśaratha, mistaking him for an elephant, on the bank of the river Sarayū. But Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa says that the name of the boy-sage who was shot dead by Daśaratha was “Śravaṇa”. For more details see 3rd Para under Daśaratha."

This Brāhmaṇa was born and brought up here. There is a story in Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 92, about him, which says that by mistake he was taken to hell by Kāla's messenger and that he was reluctant to leave hell. The story is as follows:— <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Yama (Kāla) ordered his agent to bring the Brāhmaṇa named Yajñadatta, who lived in Mahat village, born in Vasiṣṭha gotra and was gentle, scholarly and well-versed in Yajña practices. He was specially warned that he should not make a mistake as there was another Brāhmaṇa with the same name who lived in the neighbourhood and who resembled Yajñadatta in appearance, learning and in every other respect. But in spite of Yama's specific warning, his agent brought the wrong person. <dvsn n='NI'/>Yama, with his sense of justice, received him with due respect and allowed him to return to the world. But Yajñadatta was not willing to return to the world."
