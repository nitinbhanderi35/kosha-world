Whithersoever the <i>Sarasvatī</i> was summoned, thither she made her appearance. Her seven forms are <i>Suprabhā</i>, etc. (α). I) <i>Pitāmaha</i> [i.e. Brahmán] was once performing a sacrifice at <i>Puṣkara</i>; whatever he thought of, immediately appeared, the <i>Gandharvas</i> sung, the <i>Apsarases</i> danced. The <i>ṛṣis</i> missed <i>Sarasvatī, Brahmán</i> thought of her and she appeared there at <i>Puṣkara</i> under the name of <i>Suprabhā</i>. II) At <i>Naimiṣa</i> many <i>munis</i> were assembled, performing sacrifices and talking about the <i>Vedas</i>, they thought of <i>Sarasvatī</i>, who made her appearance and came to be called <i>Kāñcanākṣī</i>. III) Similarly she came to the sacrifice of <i>Gaya</i> in the country of the <i>Gayas (Gayeṣu</i>), where she flowed from the slopes of <i>Himavat</i> and was called <i>Viśālā</i>. IV) At the sacrifice of <i>Auddālaki</i> in the northern part of <i>Kosalā (uttare Kośalābhāge</i>), having been previously thought of by <i>Uddālaka</i> when sacrificing, she was mentally called <i>Manoramā</i> by the <i>ṛṣis</i>. V) At <i>Kuru's</i> sacrifice at <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, she was summoned by <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, and named <i>Oghavatī</i>. VI) At <i>Dakṣa's</i> sacrifice at <i>Gaṅgādvāra</i> she appeared under the name of <i>Sureṇu</i> (see the note of PCR. pag. 154). VII) At <i>Brahmán's</i> sacrifice on the <i>Himavat</i>, as <i>Vimalodā</i>. All these seven forms then came and mingled together in the tīrtha, which from this is known by the name of <i>Saptasārasvata</i>. “Thus I have told thee of the seven Sarasvatīs by their names and of the tīrtha <i>S.</i>; listen now to a great feat of <i>Maṅkaṇaka</i>”: IX, <b>38</b>, 2216, 2217.—§ 615<i>j</i> (Maṅkaṇaka): IX, <b>38</b>, 2243 (there Maṅkaṇaka dwelt, from his seed which fell in the Sarasvatī seven ṛṣis were born; the ascetic success of Maṅkaṇaka, cf. § 365)."
