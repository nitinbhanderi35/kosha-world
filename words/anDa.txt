            "content": "ANDHA II¦. There is a story in M.B., about a huntsman, Vaṭaka killing one Andha, an evil being. Andha whose form and shape were that of an animal, by doing tapas, became recipient of a boon for destroying everything. Brahmā rendered him blind lest the world perish, and that animal began to be known as Andha. When Andha began his programme of complete destruction many people rushed up to Viśvāmitra in his abode in the forest. Andha followed them. But, Viśvāmitra, in the interests of self-protection pointed out the refugees to Andha. As punishment for this sin Viśvāmitra had once to go to hell. This story was related by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna during the great war at Kurukṣetra, and the reason for telling the story was this: During the fight Arjuna hesitated to aim arrows against Karṇa. Enraged by this attitude of Arjuna Dharmaputra asked him to hand over his famous bow, Gāṇḍīva to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Feeling insulted at this demand Arjuna, all on a sudden, drew his sword to do away with Dharmaputra. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, prevented Arjuna from attacking his noble brother, and in this context related the above story to prove the truth that sins committed even unwittingly will lead one, as in the case of Viśvāmitra to hell. (M.B., Karṇa Parva, Chapter 69)."
