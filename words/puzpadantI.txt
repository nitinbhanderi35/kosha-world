Puṣpadantī faltered in her steps as she was admiring the beauty of Mālyavān and Indra cursed them both and turned them into devils. They then observed the Ekādaśī (eleventh day of every lunar fortnight) called ‘Jaya and got themselves released from the curse. (Chapter 43, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa)."
