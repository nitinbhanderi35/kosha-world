He once received without due regard and with indifference the tīrtha water given to him by a devotee of Kṛṣṇa after worship of the Lord, as a result of which, in the next birth, he was born as a bamboo stem. And, as he did, consciously or otherwise some good deeds Śrī Kṛṣṇa made a flute out of that bamboo stem, and Devavrata thus attained redemption. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 73)."
