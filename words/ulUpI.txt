As a result, Arjuna had to go on a pilgrimage for a year. (See under Irāvān). Arjuna reached Gaṅgādvāra. When he got down into the river Gaṅgā, he saw Ulūpī the daughter of Nāgarāja (King of the serpents). He asked her a few questions. She told him thus:—“I am the daughter of the serpent Kauravya of the family of Airāvata. I came to bathe in the river and when I saw you I grew amorous.” Arjuna told her that Dharmaputra had imposed on him celibacy for twelve months and that it was not right to marry in the meantime. Ulūpī argued with Arjuna and convinced him that it was not wrong to marry her. Arjuna married her. A son named Irāvān was born to her. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>How Ulūpī caused Arjuna to be killed and how he was</i> <i>brought to life again.</i> (See paras 28 and 29 under Arjuna). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>The end of Ulūpī.</i> After having brought Arjuna back to life, Ulūpī reached Hastināpura with Babhruvāhana and Citrāṅgadā. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 87). As soon as she reached there she greeted Kuntī, Draupadī and Subhadrā. She gave them various kinds of presents. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Aśramavāsika Parva, Chapter I, Stanza 23 that Ulūpī served Gāndhārī at one time. In Mahābhārata, Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 10, Stanza 46 it is mentioned that Ulūpī was greatly loved by the subjects. When the Pāṇḍavas began the ‘great departure’ (Mahāprasthāna) Ulūpī entered the River Ganges. Citrāṅgadā went to Maṇalūrapura. <dvsn n='NI'/>“Ulūpī, the daughter of the serpent Kauravya, jumped into the Ganges and to Maṇalūrapura, went Citrāṅgadā.” (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Mahāprasthānika Parva, Chapter 1, Stanza 27). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>The other names of Ulūpī.</i> Bhujagātmajā, Bhujagendrakanyakā, Bhujagottamā Kauravī, Kauravyaduhitā, Kauravyakulanandinī, Pannaganandinī, Pannagasutā, Pannagātmajā, Pannageśvarakanyā, Pannagī, Uragātmajā. These are the synonyms used in the Mahābhārata for Ulūpī."
