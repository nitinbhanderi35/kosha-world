Arjunābhigamanap.). § 322: The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Dhaumya</i>, on costly chariots yoked with excellent steeds, went into the forest, distributing niṣkas of gold, etc., to brahmans versed in <i>Śikṣā</i> (i.e., vedic pronunciation, PCR., or “grammar and the other vedāṅgas,” Nīl.), <i>akṣara</i> (= vedic orthography, PCR.; = veda, Nīl.), and <i>mantras</i> (= <i>praṇava</i>, i.e. the syllable <i>oṃ</i>, Nīl.), and followed by twenty attendants with bows, etc., while <i>Indrasena</i>, with the princess's (i.e. <i>Subhadrā's</i>, Nīl.) clothes and ornaments and the nurses and maidservants, followed in a chariot. The citizens walked round <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and the brahmans and principal men of <i>Kurujāṅgala</i> of all castes saluted him and blamed the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, etc. <i>Arjuna</i> told them that after their exile they would take away the good name of their enemies, and asked them to beseech the ascetics for their good. At last they returned to their respective abodes (III, <b>23</b>). After a conference between <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, they resolved upon dwelling for these twelve years at the sacred lake <i>Dvaitavana</i> (see BR.) in the forest of the same name (copious description), on the banks of <i>Bhogavatī</i> (i.e. Sarasvati, Nīl.), surrounded by many brahmans, and saluted by hosts of <i>Cāraṇas</i> and <i>Siddhas</i>, who came to see <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> (III, <b>24</b>).—§ 323: While they were dwelling there, <i>Dhaumya</i> performed their <i>iṣṭis</i> (i.e. <i>darśa-paurṇamāsa</i>, etc., Nīl.) and offerings to the <i>Pitṛs</i>, etc. Once the old <i>ṛṣi</i> <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> came to them and smiled, recollecting <i>Rāma</i> <i>Dāśarathi</i>, whom he had seen on the top of the <i>Ṛṣyamūka</i>, and comforted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> by reminding him of the aforesaid <i>Rāma</i>, <i>Nābhāga, Bhagīratha</i>, etc., and <i>Alarka</i>, the king of the <i>Kāśis</i> and the <i>Karūṣas (b</i>), the seven <i>ṛṣis</i>, who had followed the ordinance of the Creator and therefore blazed in the firmament; “so you will regain prosperity.” Then he went away in a northerly direction (III, <b>25</b>).—§ 324: The <i>Dvaitavana</i> forest becoming filled with brahmans (<i>Bhṛgus, Āṅgirasas, Vāsiṣṭhas</i>, <i>Kāśyapas, Āgastyas, Ātreyas</i>, etc.), and always resounding with Vedic recitations, mingling with the twangs of the bows of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, a beautiful union of <i>brahman</i> and <i>kṣatriya</i> customs was produced. Therefore one evening the <i>ṛṣi Baka Dālbhya</i> represented to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that the <i>kṣatriya</i> should always consult with a brahman, as did the <i>Asura</i> king <i>Bali</i>, the son of <i>Virocana</i>, who went to no other <i>tīrtha</i> than the brahmans, and then had all his wishes gratified, but who met with destruction when he began to act unjustly towards them. Then all those brahmans, <i>Dvaipāyana, Nārada, Jāmadagnya</i>, etc. (enumeration) (<i>a</i>), praised <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (III, <b>26</b>)."
