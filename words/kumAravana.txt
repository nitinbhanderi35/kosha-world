When once Sanaka and other sages went to Kumāravana to see Śiva he was seated there with Pārvatī on his lap. Seeing the sages Pārvatī got angry and cursed that men who entered the forest in future would be turned into women. King Sudyumna went to hunt in the forest ignorant of this curse, and as soon as he set foot in the forest he was turned into a woman. Purūravas was the son born to this woman by Budha. (Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha)."
