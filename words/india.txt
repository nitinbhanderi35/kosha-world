            "content": "INDIA¦. ‘South Śarakh’, a newspaper published from the United Arab Republic with the assistance of the Indian Embassy gives the following account of how the land originally known as ‘Bhārata’ came to be called India. The name ‘India’ was given to “Bhārata” by the Arabs. Even from very early times, Arabs used to give the name ‘Hind’ to their girls. In ancient Arabic love poems, this name could be seen very frequently. There were commercial and cultural contacts between Bhārata and Arab lands, from very old times. The words ‘Kharan Fūl’ (spices) ‘Pulfūl’ (Pepper) etc. may be seen in Arabic poems of the pre-Islamic period. These contacts became more intimate in later years and the Arabs began to take very great interest in the products and the people of this country. They began to call ‘Bhārata’ by the pet name ‘Hind’ which they used for their little children. They began to use the term ‘Al Hind’ when referring to Bhārata in their poems, records and trade agreements In course of time this was shortened to ‘Hind’ and finally became ‘INDIA’."
