The spectators, seeing the prowess of the princes, fancied they were beholding the city of the <i>Gandharvas. Vidura</i> described all the feats of the princes to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and <i>Kuntī</i> to <i>Gāndhārī</i> (I, <b>134</b>). A combat with maces between <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Bhīma</i> divided the spectators into two parties, until <i>Droṇa</i> caused <i>Aśvatthāman</i> to separate them. The exploits of <i>Arjuna (b</i>) were quite wonderful. <i>Droṇa</i> stood surrounded by the five <i>Pārthas</i> like the Moon in conjunction with the five-starred <i>Sāvitra</i> (i.e. <i>Hasta</i>), and <i>Duryodhana</i>, mace in hand, surrounded by his 100 brothers and <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, was like <i>Purandara</i> (i.e. <i>Indra</i>) encircled by the hosts of gods on the occasion of the victory over the <i>Dānavas</i> (I, <b>135</b>). <i>Karṇa (c</i>) enters and challenges <i>Arjuna</i>. The <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> stood by <i>Karṇa</i>, while <i>Droṇa</i>, <i>Kṛpa</i>, and <i>Bhīṣma</i> remained with <i>Arjuna. Kuntī</i> swooned away, and was restored to consciousness by <i>Vidura</i>, who caused sandal paste and water to be sprinkled on her person. <i>Kṛpa</i> rejects <i>Karṇa</i>; but <i>Duryodhana</i> then installed <i>Karṇa</i> as king of <i>Aṅga</i> (I, <b>136</b>). The sun went down; <i>Duryodhana</i> led <i>Karṇa</i> out of the arena, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, accompanied by <i>Droṇa, Kṛpa</i>, and <i>Bhīṣma</i>, returned to their abodes (I, <b>137</b>)."
