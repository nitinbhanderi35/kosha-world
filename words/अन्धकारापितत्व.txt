The <ab>mss.</ab> are corrupt in the entire passage (see <b>lokāntarikā</b>) and particularly at this point; <ls>Senart</ls> reads °kārārpitā, but there is no support for the -r- in the <ab>mss.</ab> The <ls>Mv</ls> seems to have read andhakārā andhakārāpitatvā (? °yitatvā), tamisrā <b>tamisrāyitatvā</b> (<ab>q.v.</ab>), <i>darknesses, darkenednesses, glooms, begloomednesses</i>. Only <ls>Mv</ls> has the second member of each pair (the derivatives of <lex>denom.</lex> <lex>pples.</lex>); the other parallel passages point to something like andhakārā <b>andhakāratamisrāḥ</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab>"
