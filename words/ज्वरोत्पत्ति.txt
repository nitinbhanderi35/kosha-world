There <i>Śiva</i> used to sit with <i>Pārvatī</i>, waited upon by D., V., etc. (α). After some time the <i>Prajāpati</i> <i>Dakṣa</i> commenced to perform a sacrifice, whither all the gods headed by <i>Indra</i>, with the permission of <i>Śiva</i>, repaired mounted on their chariots, proceeding to that spot whence the <i>Gaṅgā</i> is said to issue. <i>Pārvatī</i> asked why <i>Śiva</i> did not himself proceed thither, and was told that in days of yore the deities made an arrangement in consequence of which no share was assigned to <i>Śiva</i> of offerings in sacrifices. He was filled with grief. <i>Śiva</i> ordered <i>Nandin</i> to wait there, and summoning all his <i>yoga</i> force, he, with all his terrible followers, came and destroyed that sacrifice (description); it assumed the form of a deer and tried to fly away through the skies, pursued by <i>Śiva</i> with bow and arrow. A drop of sweat fell from his forehead down on the earth; there appeared a terrible fire, whence issued a dreadful being of very short stature, etc. (description), who consumed the embodied form of sacrifice and then attacked D. and Ṛ., who fled in all directions. The earth began to tremble, etc. <i>Brahmán</i> appeased <i>Śiva</i> by promising him a share of the sacrificial offerings; the being that had sprung from his sweat should be distributed among all creatures as fever (description of the distribution). Blessing upon the reader (XII, <b>284</b>)."
