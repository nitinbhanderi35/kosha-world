(See Ikṣvāku vaṃśa) while the King Kalmāṣapāda was walking through the forest hunting he saw Śakti the son of Vasiṣṭha. As Śakti did not care to give room for the King, Kalmāṣapāda wounded Śakti, who cursed the King and changed him to a Rākṣasa (giant). The giant immediately killed Śakti. After many years Vasiṣṭha blessed the King and changed the form of the giant and gave him back his former shape. The King was delighted at having recovered his former shape. He took Vasiṣṭha to his palace. Madayantī the wife of the King with his permission went to Vasiṣṭha and got with child. Vasiṣṭha returned to the forest. Even after the lapse of a long period she did not give birth to the child. Madayantī who was miserable at this, took an ‘aśman’ (a small cylindrical piece of the granite used to crush things placed on a flat square piece of granite) and crushed her stomach with it and she delivered a son. As he was born by using ‘Aśma’ he was named Aśmaka. This King had built a city called Paudhanyā. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 176)."
