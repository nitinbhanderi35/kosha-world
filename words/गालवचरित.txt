Gālavasya caritaṃ). § 565 (Bhagavady.): In ancient times, in order to try <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, who was then engaged in ascetic austerities, <i>Dharma</i> in the form of the <i>Ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha</i>, and feigning himself hungry, came to his hermitage. <i>Viśvāmitra</i> cooked <i>caru</i>, but could not approach <i>Dharma</i> before his guest had dined with the other hermits. <i>Dharma</i> said, “I have already dined; wait here,” and went away. <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, bearing that food on his head and himself subsisting on air, waited a hundred years, while the ascetic <i>Gālava</i> waited on him. Then <i>Dharma</i> accepted that food, which was still warm and fresh, and called <i>Viśvāmitra</i> a <i>viprarṣi</i>, whereby he became a <i>brahman</i>. <i>Gālava</i> repeatedly asked <i>Viśvāmitra</i> to take a gift from him as his preceptor, and at last <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, seeing his persistency, requested him to give 800 white steeds each with one black ear (V, <b>106</b>). <i>Gālava</i> got troubled and was gradually reduced to a skeleton. He thought of repairing to <i>Viṣṇu</i> (or <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>), when his friend <i>Garuḍa</i> came, and said he had spoken to <i>Viṣṇu</i> in his behalf, and that he would bear him (V, <b>107</b>). <i>Garuḍa</i> described the East: here <i>Savitṛ</i> first rises, and the <i>tapas</i> of the <i>Sādhyas</i> is performed at eve;…the two eyes of <i>Dharma</i>;…here the daughters of <i>Dakṣa</i> in primeval times gave birth to their children, and here the sons of <i>Kaśyapa</i> first multiplied; here <i>Śakra</i> was first anointed as king of the gods; here is the <i>tapas</i> of <i>Indra</i> and the gods, all their religious ceremonies; here the Creator (<i>bhagavān</i> <i>Lokabhāvanaḥ</i>) first sang the <i>Vedas</i>; here <i>Sāvitrī</i> was first said by <i>Savitṛ</i> to the reciters of the <i>Vedas (brahmavādiṣu</i>), and here the Yajurveda (<i>yajūṃṣi</i>) was given by <i>Sūrya</i>; here the <i>Soma</i> juice was first drunk by the gods, etc.; it was here that <i>Varuṇa</i>, repairing to <i>Pātāla</i>, obtained prosperity (<i>śriyaṃ</i>); here the birth, growth, and death of the ancient <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> took place; here first grew the hundred branches (<i>sṛtayaḥ</i>) of <i>oṃ</i>; here the <i>Munis</i> called <i>dhūmapāḥ</i> first imbibed the smoke of the <i>havis</i>; here the thousand-rayed Sun slays, rising, the wicked and ungrateful men and <i>Asuras</i>; here is the gate of the three worlds and the path to heaven and to felicity (V, <b>108</b>). <i>Garuḍa</i> menṭioned the remarkable subjects in the South (<i>dakṣiṇā diś</i>, so called because <i>Vivasvat</i> gave it away as a <i>dakṣiṇā</i>): <i>Pitṛpakṣas trailokasya; Ūṣmapāḥ devāḥ</i>; the <i>Viśvedevas</i> with the <i>Pitṛs</i>, with whom they equally share the sacrifices in all the worlds; the second door of <i>Dharma…</i>; the <i>Devarṣis, Pitṛlokarṣis</i>, and <i>Rājarṣis</i>, who dwell here in great happiness…; it is the region whither all must repair;…there are <i>Nairṛtāḥ</i> to be seen by the sinful; the <i>Gandharvas</i> chanting on <i>Mandara</i> and in the abodes of the <i>viprarṣis; Raivata</i> who, hearing the <i>Sāmans</i>, retired to the woods, leaving wife and friends and kingdom; <i>Sāvarṇi</i> and <i>Yāvakrīta</i> setting a limit to <i>Sūrya</i> (the southern tropical circle, PCR.); <i>Rāvaṇa</i> soliciting immortality from the gods; <i>Vṛtra</i> incurring the enmity of <i>Śakra; Vaitaraṇī</i> filled with the bodies of persons condemned to hell…; reaching this region the sun drops sweet water (i.e. the beginning of the rainy season, Nīl.), and thence, proceeding again to the <i>Vāsiṣtha</i> direction (<i>Vāsiṣṭhīṃ kāṣṭhāṃ</i> = the quarter of the seven Ṛṣis, i.e. the North, Nīl), once more drops dew (<i>himaṃ</i>); there is <i>Garuḍa</i> obtaining for food an enormous elephant and tortoise; the great <i>Ṛṣi Cakradhanus</i> birth from <i>Sūrya</i> took place here (he was afterwards known as <i>Kapila</i> who burned <i>Sagara's</i> sons); the perfect (<i>siddhāḥ</i>) brahmans, named <i>Śivāḥ</i>, who fully had mastered the <i>Vedas</i>, here obtained liberation (<i>mokṣa</i>); here is <i>Bhogavatī</i>, ruled by <i>Vāsuki, Takṣaka</i>, and <i>Airāvata</i>. Those that have to journey hither encounter here a thick gloom, so that it cannot be penetrated by either the Sun or by <i>Agni</i>; “even thou shalt have to pass this road” (V, <b>109</b>). <i>Garuḍa</i> mentioned the remarkable subjects and occurrences of the West: <i>Varuṇa's</i> origin; his instalment by <i>Kaśyapa</i>; the Moon, quaffing all the six juices of <i>Varuṇa</i>, becomes young again in the beginning of the bright fortnight; the <i>Daityas</i> being routed and bound fast by <i>Vāyu</i>; the mountain <i>Asta</i>; Night and Sleep; <i>Śakra</i> beholding the goddess (<i>devīṃ) Diti</i> asleep, and cutting off her fœtus, whence sprang the <i>Maruts</i>; the roots of <i>Himavat</i> stretching towards the eternal <i>Mandara</i> (sunk in the Ocean, Nīl.), the end of which is not to be reached by journeying for even 1,000 years; <i>Surabhi</i> milking on the shores of the lake with golden lotuses; in the midst of the Ocean the headless trunk of <i>Svarbhānu</i>; the chanting of the <i>Vedas</i> by <i>Suvarṇa-</i> <i>śiras</i> (invisible, and whose hair is eternally yellow); <i>Dhvajavatī</i>, the daughter of the <i>muni Harimedhas</i>, remaining in the air in consequence of <i>Sūrya's</i> injunction, ‘stay’;…the sources of the rivers; here, in the abode of <i>Varuṇa</i>, are the waters of the three worlds; the abode of <i>Ananta</i>, and of <i>Viṣṇu</i>, and of <i>Pavana</i> (the friend of <i>Agni</i>), and of the <i>Maharṣi Kaśyapa</i> <i>Mārīca</i> (V, <b>110</b>). The North (<i>uttara</i>) has its name from saving (<i>uttāraṇa</i>) from sin; it is also called <i>madhyama</i>, i.e. between the East and the West. None can live there that is unamiable, etc. <i>Garuḍa</i> mentioned its remarkable subjects and places: <i>Badarī</i>, the asylum of <i>Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa</i>, <i>Jiṣṇu</i>, and <i>Brahmán; Maheśvara</i> with the effulgence of the <i>yugānta</i> fire; <i>Puruṣa</i> dwelling with <i>Prakṛti</i>, invisible to <i>munis</i>, D. with I., G., Y., and Si., except <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>; there <i>Viṣṇu</i> appears alone, having 1,000 heads and 1,000 legs; there <i>Candramas</i> (the Moon) was installed in the sovereignty over the <i>brahmans; Mahādeva</i> receiving <i>Gaṅgā</i> on his head; <i>Devī</i> practising austerities for obtaining <i>Maheśvara; Kāma</i>; the wrath (of <i>Śiva</i>, PCR.); here took place <i>Kubera's</i> instalment, on the breast of <i>Kailāsa</i>, in the sovereignty of Rā., Y., and G.; <i>Caitraratha</i>; here is the asylum of the <i>Vaikhānasas; Mandākinī; Mandara</i>; <i>Saugandhikavana</i>, guarded by <i>Nairṛtas</i>; the plantain forest (<i>kadalī-skandhaṃ</i>), etc.; the <i>Siddhas</i>; the seven <i>Ṛṣis</i> with <i>Arundhatī; Svāti; Brahmán</i> near <i>Yajña…</i> the <i>munis</i> named <i>Dhāmā</i> (? so B.) (whose origin, etc., are not known) guarding <i>Gāyantikādvāra</i> (B. <i>Gaṅgāmahādvāraṃ</i>); the man who passes beyond them will certainly meet with destruction, except <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> and <i>Nara</i> or <i>Jiṣṇu</i>; here is <i>Kailāsa</i>, the abode of <i>Ailavila</i>; the origin of the ten <i>Apsarases Vidyut-</i> <i>prabhāḥ; Viṣṇupada</i>, made by <i>Viṣṇu</i>, when he, in his covering the worlds with three steps, stepped on the northern region; here took place king <i>Marutta's</i> sacrifice at <i>Uśīrabīja</i>, by the side of the golden lake; here was <i>Himavat's</i> gold-mine, that exhibited itself to the <i>viprarṣi Jīmūta</i>, who gave away the whole wealth to the brahmans, and had it called after his name (<i>Jaimūta</i>); here morning and evening the <i>Lokapālas</i> (<i>diśāṃ pālaṇ</i> proclaim “what business of what person shall we do?’ it is called <i>uttara</i> (North) because it is superior (<i>uttara</i>) to all (V. <b>111</b>). At the request of <i>Gālava, Garuḍa</i> carried him (description) to the East, and laughed at his foolish thoughts of casting away his life. At the mountain <i>Ṛṣabha</i> they rested for some time (V, <b>112</b>). On the peak of the <i>Ṛṣabha</i> they met with a brahman lady, <i>Śāṇḍilī</i>, engaged in penances; she gave them cooked food; they fell asleep. As <i>Garuḍa</i> awoke, his wings had fallen off. It was because he had, out of pity, thought of carrying the lady to the place where <i>Mahādeva, Viṣṇu</i>, etc. (α), live together. She gave him his wings back, having warned him not to contemn women, and they set out, but failed to find the steeds. <i>Viśvāmitra</i> met them, and said the time had already passed, but promised to wait for some time more (V, <b>113</b>). <i>Garuḍa</i> explained the etymology of <i>hiraṇya</i> (gold) and <i>dhana</i> (wealth), and why gold is not easily obtainable (see the note of PCR. from Nīl.); it is guarded by the <i>Ajaikapād-</i> <i>Ahirbradhnāḥ</i> and by <i>Dhanada</i> (i.e. <i>Kubera</i>). They went to <i>Garuḍa's</i> friend, the <i>Rājarṣi Yayāti Nāhuṣa</i> (of the Lunar race), in <i>Pratiṣṭhāna</i>, and told him the matter, and that <i>Gālava</i>, when he had paid off his debt, would devote himself to severe ascetic penances and give <i>Yayāti</i> a portion of his wealth of asceticism; “as many hairs as there are in a horse's body, so many regions of bliss are attained by him that gives away a horse” (V, <b>114</b>). <i>Yayāti</i>, the performer of 1000 sacrifices, the liberal ruler of all the <i>Kāśis</i>, in view of the fact that they had come to him, passing over all the kings of the Solar race, not having the steeds, gave to <i>Gālava</i> his daughter <i>Mādhavī</i>, always solicited by gods, men, and <i>Asuras. Garuḍa</i> went away to his own abode, and <i>Gālava</i> offered <i>Mādhavī</i> to king <i>Haryaśva</i> of <i>Ikṣvāku's</i> race at <i>Ayodhyā</i>, who was desirous of offspring (V, <b>115</b>), on the condition that he gave as her dower the 800 steeds of the kind wanted. <i>Haryaśva</i> had but 200 steeds of this kind; he therefore got the maiden—who by a brahman had been granted the boon that after each delivery she would be a maiden again—in order to beget only one son upon her, for his 200 steeds. This son was <i>Vasumanas</i>. Then <i>Gālava</i> offered her to king <i>Divodāsa</i> (V, <b>116</b>), the <i>Kāśi</i> king, son of <i>Bhīmasena</i>. The same arrangement was made as with <i>Haryaśva</i>. She bore him <i>Pratardana</i> (V, <b>117</b>). Then <i>Gālava</i> came to king <i>Uśīnara</i> in the city of the <i>Bhojas</i>, with whom the same arrangement was made. To him she bore <i>Śibi</i> Then <i>Gālava</i> took the maiden and went to see <i>Garuḍa</i> (V, <b>118</b>). <i>Garuḍa</i> said that the remaining 200 steeds were unobtainable. For in days of yore <i>Ṛcīka</i> sought at <i>Kānya-</i> <i>kubja Gādhi's</i> daughter <i>Satyavatī</i> in marriage, and was requested by <i>Gādhi</i> to give 1000 steeds of this kind. <i>Ṛcīka</i> obtained them at <i>Aśvatīrtha</i>, and gave them to the king. Performing the sacrifice <i>Puṇḍarīka</i>, the king gave them away to the <i>brahmans</i>. The three kings had each purchased 200 of them from the <i>brahmans</i>, but the remaining 400, while being transported over the <i>Vitastā</i>, were taken by the river (so B.). <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, instead of obtaining the 200 steeds wanting, begot <i>Aṣṭaka</i> upon <i>Mādhavī</i>, and gave him the steeds; <i>Aṣṭaka</i> then went to a certain city (<i>puraṃ prāyāt</i> <i>tadā Somapuraprabhaṃ</i>) and <i>Kauśika</i> (i.e. <i>Viśvāmitra</i>) to the woods. <i>Gālava</i> dismissed <i>Garuḍa</i>, and returning the maiden to her father, he went into the woods (V, <b>119</b>). <i>Yayāti</i> went to a hermitage on the confluence of the <i>Gangā</i> and <i>Yamunā</i>, taking <i>Mādhavī, Pūru</i>, and <i>Yadu</i> with him, desirous of again disposing of his daughter in a <i>svayaṃvara</i>. There was assembled a vast concourse of N., Y., G., men, etc., and numerous <i>Ṛṣis</i> resembling <i>Brahmán</i> himself. <i>Mādhavī</i> selected the forest as her lord, practised <i>tapas</i>, and adopted a deer's mode of life (<i>mṛgacāriṇī</i>). King <i>Yayāti</i> died after having lived for many thousands of years. The progeny of <i>Pūru</i> and <i>Yadu</i> multiplied greatly. <i>Yayāti</i>, resembling a <i>maharṣi</i>, enjoyed the highest bliss in heaven for many thousands of years. On one occasion, while seated among the <i>Rājarṣis</i> and <i>Maharṣis</i>, king <i>Yayāti</i> mentally disregarded all the gods and <i>Ṛṣis</i> and men. <i>Indra</i> at once read his heart; the dwellers of heaven did not longer know him, and he was soon divested of his splendour (V. <b>120</b>).
