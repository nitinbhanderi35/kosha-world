A river in Orthern India which falls into the Gaṅgā. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Origin.</i> There arose an argument between the Devas and the asuras about the Amṛtam (nectar) got from the churning of Kṣīrābdhi (the milk ocean) and Mahāviṣṇu appeared in the form of Mohinī and enticed the asuras away from the subject and gave the nectar to the Devas. Attracted by the great beauty of Mohinī, Śiva made love to her, and the sweet produced at the time of their embrace flowed as river Gaṇḍaki through the earth. (Skandha Purāṇa, Āsura Khaṇḍa). <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>It became a holy river.</i> While the worms on the banks of Gaṇḍakī were once collecting soil they fell into the river, and all at once they attained salvation, the reason being that the water in the river had been formed by the sweet of Viṣṇu and Śiva. And, from that day onwards people began worshipping Gaṇḍakī as a holy river. (Skandha Purāṇa, Āsura Khaṇḍa). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Other information.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) He who drinks the water of the river is freed from sins. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 169, Verse 20). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) The river is also known as Nārāyaṇī, Śālagrāmī, Hiraṇvatī and Hiraṇyavatī. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 25). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iii) Śrī Kṛṣṇa Arjuna and Bhīmasena once on their way from Indraprastha to Girivraja crossed this river. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 20, Verse 27). <dvsn n='NI'/>(iv) The water in Gaṇḍakī is a mixture of the waters of all holy rivers. Therefore, a bath in Gaṇḍakī is of equal value as an Aśvamedha yajña and he who bathes in it will attain Sūryaloka. (Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 113). <dvsn n='NI'/>(v) Gaṇḍakī is one of the rivers which were responsible for the origin of Agni (fire). (Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 113)."
