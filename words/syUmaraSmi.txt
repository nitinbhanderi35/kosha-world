It is stated in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 238, that this hermit got into the stomach of a cow and sitting there, talked with the hermit Kapila about the ways of Karma and renunciation This hermit Syūmaraśmi is as ancient as the Ṛgveda. A statement as follows, occurs in Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 16, Sūkta 112. “Ye Aśvins who are the Leaders. Come here also with those protective weapons by which you gave protection to Atri, Śaṃyu and Manu, and the arrows by shooting which you saved Syūmaraśmi.”"
