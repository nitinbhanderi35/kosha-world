The gods, etc. (α), came there. Ṛ. <i>Dadhīca</i> in wrath and grief said that this was no sacrifice, since <i>Rudra</i> (Śiva) was not adored in it, etc.; he, the great <i>yogin</i>, saw into the future; he beheld <i>Śiva</i> seated with <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Umā. Dakṣa</i> said he knew the eleven <i>Rudras</i> with lances and matted locks, but he did not know who this <i>Maheśvara</i> was. <i>Dakṣa</i> said that he would perform the sacrifice unto Viṣṇu. Umā felt grief. <i>Śiva</i> said that it is to him as the Lord of Sacrifices that the chanters utter their praises in sacrifices, etc. (β). Then he created from his mouth a terrible being (description), and <i>Umā</i> herself, assuming the terrible form of <i>Mahākālī</i>, proceeded in the company of that being, that was the living embodiment of <i>Śiva's</i> wrath and resembled <i>Śiva</i> himself, and came to be called <i>Vīrabhadra</i>. He then created from the pores of his body a large number of spirit-chiefs named <i>Raumyas</i>. These <i>Rudras</i> attacked the sacrifice (description; Ṛ., D., and men looked pale) and began to set fire to everything, and tore off the head of the sacrifice. D. and <i>Brahmán</i> and <i>Dakṣa</i>, informed by <i>Vīrabhadra</i>, hymned <i>Śiva</i> (γ), who, asked by <i>Dakṣa</i>, granted to him the boon that his sacrificial articles should be of use to him. Then Dakṣa knelt down and uttered his 1008 names (v. <is>Dakṣa-prokta-</is> <is>Śiva-sahasranāmastotra</is>)."
