A synonym of Mahāviṣṇu. <dvsn n='NI'/>There is a place called Gayā to the north of Mount Kālañjara to the south of Himālayas, to the east of Kuśasthalī and to the west of Vasupura. Once a king called Gaya conducted at Gayā an Aśvamedha, a Naramedha (yajña at which man is offered as sacrifice) and a Mahāmedha and Mahāviṣṇu acted as gate-keeper of Gaya. As Viṣṇu stood guard there holding the gadā (club) in his hands he came to be known as Gadādhara also thenceforth. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 76)."
