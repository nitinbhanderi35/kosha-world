There is a story in Chapter 72, Vāmana Purāṇa about these children who became Maruts. <dvsn n='NI'/>Ṛtadhvaja, son of Svārociṣa Manu had seven heroic sons. They went to Mahāmeru and began to worship Brahmā for gaining Indra's place. Indra was alarmed. He sent the Apsarā woman Pūtanā to the sons of Ṛtadhvaja to obstruct their tapas. There was a river flowing by the side of their āśrama. Ṛtadhvaja's sons came to the river to take their bath. Just at that time, Pūtanā also came there and began to take bath. At her sight, the young men had an involuntary emission of semen. Śaṅkhinī, wife of the crocodile Mahāśaṅkha swallowed it. The princes whose tapas was interrupted returned to the palace. Pūtanā returned to Indra and reported the matter. <dvsn n='NI'/>After some years, Śaṅkhinī happened to be caught in a fisherman's net. The fisherman caught her and informed Ṛtadhvaja's sons about his catch. They took her to the palace and put her in a tank there. In due course Śaṅkhinī gave birth to seven children. Immediately after that she attained mokṣa. The children began to cry for mother's milk, moving about in the water. Then Brahmā appeared to them and told them not to cry and assured them that they would become the Devas of “Vāyu Skandha”. He took them up to the sky and put them in Vāyuskandha. These children were the Maruts of the Svārociṣa Manvantara."
