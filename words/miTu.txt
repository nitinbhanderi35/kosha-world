Once Bharata son of Ārṣṭiṣeṇa was making preparations for an Aśvamedha on the banks of the river Sarasvatī with Upamanyu as his priest when Mithu came and took them both to Pātāla. Then Devāpi, son of Upamanyu, got his father and the King released from there by continuous worship of Śiva (Brahma Purāṇa—127. 56-57)."
