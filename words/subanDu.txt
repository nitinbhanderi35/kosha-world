Once the King removed the priest from his job and appointed two priests, Kirāta and Ākuli in his stead, and after some time, the new priests, at the instance of the King, killed Subandhu. But, three brothers of his joined together and brought Subandhu back to life again by chanting hymns from the Vedas. (Ṛgveda 10, 57. 60; Bṛhaddevatā. 7. 33)."
