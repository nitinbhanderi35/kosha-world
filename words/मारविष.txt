The first part of the name is Māra which is the name of the god of love who in the Buddhist literature is described as the greatest enemy of the Buddha and his religion.<sup>83</sup> The second part of the name is not legible. If it is <i>viṣa</i> then the whole can literally mean ‘one who is a poison for the god of love’, i.e., a man of great self-control whom the arrows of Māra cannot affect."
