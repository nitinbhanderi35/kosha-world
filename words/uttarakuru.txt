Mention is made in the Mahābhārata that during his conquest Arjuna had gone up to this place and carried away from there plenty of wealth. It is believed by common people that this place is inaccessible to human beings. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 28, Stanzas 7 to 20). The southern end of this place is the Nīlagiri and the Northern end Mount Meru. The inhabitants are gifted people, with trees bearing flowers and fruits, the flowers fragrant and the fruits sweet. <dvsn n='NI'/>A particular type of tree known as Kṣīrī (milky) grows here from which milk will flow. There are also trees which will give you whatever you ask. It was the belief of ancient people that with the fruits of Kṣīrī, you could make garments and ornaments. The soil of this place contains gems and in the sand there is gold. Those who fall down from heaven live in this region. The average age of the inhabitants of this place is said to have been eleven thousand years. There is a kind of bird in this place called Bhāruṇḍa. These birds drag dead bodies away to caves. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 8, Stanzas 2 to 13)."
