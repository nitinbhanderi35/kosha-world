Dambhodbhavasya ākhyānaṃ.) § 563 (Bhagavady.): There was a king of yore named <i>Dambhodbhava</i>, who was at the head of the earth; his sovereignty extended over the whole world. Every morning he used to ask if there were anyone superior or even equal to himself. Certain brahmans counselled him to curb his pride; and as he continued to ask the brahmans the same question day after day, some high-souled brahmans mentioned to him the ascetics <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, “who have taken their birth in the race of men, and are now practising penances on <i>Gandhamādana</i>.” The king marched to the spot with a large army, and found them emaciated with hunger and thirst, etc. He desired a battle with them. The <i>Ṛṣis</i> declined; but as he repeatedly summoned them to fight, <i>Nara</i> took up a handful of grass-blades, and therewith baffled all their arrows and cut off the eyes and ears and noses of the warriors. The king fell at the feet of the <i>Ṛṣis</i> and said, “Let me be blessed.” <i>Nara</i> then told him to be obedient to the <i>brahmans</i> and be virtuous. The king returned to his city, and from that time began to practise righteousness."
