But mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the Kurus)<sup>174</sup> and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.<sup>175</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>176</sup> refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>177</sup> as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice. <dvsn n='P'/>Oldenberg<sup>178</sup> seems to be right in suggesting that the Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.<sup>179</sup> Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda<sup>180</sup> as having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later Kurukshetra.<sup>181</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often connected with Pāñcālas.<sup>182</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).<sup>183</sup> A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.<sup>184</sup> It appears from a passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>185</sup> There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it spread thence east, south and west. <sup>186</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>187</sup> where they are located beyond the Himalayas (pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,<sup>188</sup> however, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya to be a land of the gods (<i>deva-kṣetra</i>), but Jānṃtapi Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kurukshetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir might naturally be found.<sup>189</sup> In Buddhist literature, UttaraKuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory of a country that once had a historical existence.<sup>190</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are told by Kauṭilya<sup>191</sup> that the Kurus were <i>‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,</i> or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank and rights.<sup>192</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Shafer<sup>193</sup> shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably nonĀryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern Kurus were Muṇḍic.<sup>194</sup>"
