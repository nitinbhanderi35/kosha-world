Since the column bearing the inscription was originally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of Bihar,<sup>231</sup> we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern village of the same name in the Rājagṛha viṣaya which is not very far from Nālandā.<sup>232</sup> The name of the viṣaya which included this town can possibly be restored as Rājagṛha in the damaged part of the inscription."
