Later it got the name Vāraṇāsī and then Kāśī. The name Vāraṇāsī is originated from two rivers. Bhagavān Yogaśāyī who stays in Prayāga was born from a portion of Mahāviṣṇu. From the right leg of Yogaśāyī the river Varaṇā started and from his left leg the river Asī started. These two rivers are praised and worshipped all over the world.
