Once the Kolāhala mountain fell in love with this river and kept it within himself. Uparicaravasu who came to know of this, gave a kick to the mountain. The kick produced a hole in the mountain and the river emerged through that hole. Śuktimatī had a son and a daughter by Kolāhala mountain. The river presented them to the King. The King appointed the son as his military commander. Girikā, the daughter of the river became the King's wife. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 63, Verse 34)."
