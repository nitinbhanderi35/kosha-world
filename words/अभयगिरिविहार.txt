(-रः) The Buddhist monastery Abhayagiri in Anurādhapura which is said to have been founded by the king <i>Vartagāmani,</i> in commemoration of a taunt held out to him by a Nighaṇṭa Brāhmaṇa of the name of <i>Giri,</i> when he fled after an unsuccessful encounter with the Damila, the king making a vow to build a monastery if he should be victorious; he called it Abhayagiri from the name of the Brāhmaṇa (<i>Giri</i>) and the surname <i>Abhaya</i> he had assumed himself. (Comp. <i>Turnour'</i>s <i>Mahāv.</i> p. 206 and <i>Lassen'</i>s <i>Ind. Alt.</i> II. p. 433.) The monastery is famed for the sect which inhabited it (see अभयगिरिवासिन्) and a tope erected in it. (Comp. <i>Wilson'</i>s <i>Ariana Antiqua</i> p. 39 and <i>Lassen'</i>s <i>Ind. Alt.</i> II. p. 1008.) E. अभय-गिरि and विहार."
