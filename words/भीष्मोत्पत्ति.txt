They had eight children; but seven of them were, as soon as they were born, thrown into the water by her. The eighth was rescued by <i>Śāntanu's</i> interfering. But then <i>Gaṅgā</i>, telling him who she was, and that his sons were the eight <i>Vasu's</i> who had been cursed by <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, left him (I, 98). (For continuation v. Āpavop.)"
