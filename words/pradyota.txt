Kṣemaka alias Śunaka father of Pradyota was killed by Mlecchas (a barbarous tribe). To avenge the death of his father Pradyota under the advice of Nārada decided to conduct a Mleccha Yajña and for that purpose dug a Yajñakuṇḍa seventeen miles long and seventeen miles wide. The Yajña started and in that Yajṅa different kinds of Mlecchas were burnt to death. From then onwards Pradyumna got the name ‘Mlecchahantā’ (killer of Mlecchas). (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa)."
