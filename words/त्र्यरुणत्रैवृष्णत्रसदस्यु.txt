            "content": "<b>Try-aruṇa Trai-vṛṣṇa Trasadasyu</b>¦ is the name of a prince whose generosity to a singer is celebrated in a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he appears as <b>Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka,</b> and is the hero of the following story. He was out in his chariot with his Purohita, or domestic priest, <b>Vṛśa Jāna,</b> and by excessive speed in driving killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Purohita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The Śāṭyāyana Brāhmaṇa, cited by Sāyaṇa,<sup>3</sup> elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder. The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs — being Kṣatriyas they were partial to a Kṣatriya — Agni's glow ceased to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> which connects the story with a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> Sieg's attempt<sup>6</sup> to show that the hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful.<sup>7</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is clear that Trasadasyu must here mean ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ and not King Trasadasyu himself. The difference of the patronymics, Traivṛṣṇa and Traidhātva, by which he is referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan), from whom Tryaruṇa was descended.<sup>8</sup> The connexion with the Ikṣvākus is important (see <b>Ikṣvāku</b>). <F>1) v. 27, 1-3.</F> <F>2) xiii. 3, 12. <i>Cf.</i> the Tāṇḍaka recension, cited in Sāyaṇa, on Rv. v. 2, where Trasadasyu is given as the king's name.</F> <F>3) On Rv., <i>loc. cit.</i> See also the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa version in Oertel, <i>Journal of the American Oriental Society,</i> 18, 20.</F> <F>4) v. 14 <i>et seq.,</i> with Macdonell's notes.</F> <F>5) v. 2.</F> <F>6) <i>Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda,</i> 64-76. <i>Cf.</i> Geldner, <i>Festtgruss an Roth,</i> 192.</F> <F>7) See Oldenberg, <i>Sacred Books of the</i> <i>East,</i> 46, 366 <i>et seq.; Ṛgveda-Noten,</i> 1, 312; Hillebrandt, <i>Göttingische Gelehrte</i> <i>Anzeigen,</i> 1903, 240 <i>et seq.</i></F> <F>8) See Sieg, <i>op. cit.,</i> 74-76, and <b>Trasadasyu.</b></F>"
