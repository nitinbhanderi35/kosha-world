Draupadīharaṇa(ṃ) parva.) § 521: While <i>Duryodhana</i>, <i>Duḥśāsana, Karṇa</i>, and <i>Śakuni</i> were longing to harm the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Durvāsas</i> arrived with 10,000 disciples, and harassed <i>Duryodhana</i> with his whimsical and insolent behaviour; but as <i>Duryodhana</i> was neither angered nor annoyed, he granted him a boon. According to what had been agreed upon between himself and <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, <i>Duryodhana</i> asked <i>Durvāsas</i> to visit the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with his disciples, when <i>Draupadī</i>, after having regaled the <i>brahmans</i>, etc., with food, would have gone to rest. <i>Durvāsas</i> promised to do so (III, <b>262</b>). Then <i>Durvāsas</i> one day came to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with 10,000 disciples, when the meal was over and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> was reposing. <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> then praised <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who, leaving <i>Rūkmiṇī</i>, who was sleeping by his side, came to her and demanded something to eat. <i>Draupadī</i> became embarrassed, because the sun-given vessel only remained full till she had finished her meal, and therefore now was empty. At the request of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> she, however, fetched the vessel, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> found a particle of rice and vegetable sticking at its rim, and swallowing it he said to her: “May it please the god who is the soul of the universe (<i>viśvātmā</i>), and may the partaker of sacrifices (<i>yajñabhuk</i>) be satisfied.” Then he ordered <i>Bhīma</i> (B. <i>Sahadeva</i>) to invite the <i>munis</i> to dinner. Meanwhile those ascetics, having bathed in the river, observed that their stomachs were full, and as <i>Durvāsas</i> feared that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> would destroy them, looking down upon them with angry eyes, because the repast had been uselessly prepared for them (“I am afraid,” said <i>Durvāsas</i>, “of men that are devoted to <i>Hari</i>”), they all ran away, so that <i>Bhīma</i> (B. <i>Sahadeva</i>) sought for them in vain. As the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were afraid that the <i>munis</i> might return at night and curse them, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> suddenly appeared and consoled them. Then he repaired to his capital (III, <b>263</b>).—§ 522: One day when the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had gone a-hunting, leaving <i>Draupadī</i> in the hermitage with the permission of the great <i>ṛṣi Tṛṇabindu</i> and of <i>Dhaumya</i>, the king of <i>Sindhu</i> (of <i>Sauvīra</i>, v. 15599; of the <i>Śibis, Sauvīras, Sindhus</i>, etc., 15621), <i>Jayadratha Vārddhakṣattri</i>, who, with a view of matrimony, was on his way to the king of the <i>Śālveyas</i>, halted in the wood of <i>Kāmyaka</i>, and seeing <i>Draupadī</i> standing at the threshold of the hermitage, he fell in love with her, and sent king <i>Koṭikāsya</i> (king <i>Suratha's</i> son, v. 15593; the foremost of the Śibis, v. 15602) to inquire who she was (III, <b>264</b>). <i>Koṭikāsya</i> introduced himself to <i>Draupadī</i> and showed her the Trigarta king <i>Kṣemaṅkara</i>, and the son of the king of the <i>Kulindas</i> (“who always lives in the mountains”), and the son of <i>Subala</i> (B. <i>Subhava</i>) of the race of <i>Ikṣvāku</i>; he said that <i>Jayadratha</i> was there at the head of 6,000 chariots, etc., followed by twelve <i>Sauvīra</i> princes as his standard-bearers (<i>Aṅgāraka</i>, etc., enumerated) (α), and his brothers (<i>Balāhaka</i>, <i>Anīka, Vidāraṇa</i>, etc.) (III, <b>265</b>). <i>Draupadī</i> told <i>Koṭikāsya</i> who she was, and that her husbands were out a-hunting (<i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to the east, <i>Bhīma</i> towards the south, <i>Arjuna</i> to the west, and the <i>Aśvins</i> towards the north), and invited them to alight and await the return of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (III, <b>266</b>). <i>Koṭikāsya</i> told <i>Jayadratha</i> the words of <i>Draupadī</i>, and exhorted him to take her with him to the <i>Sauvīras</i>. <i>Jayadratha</i> introduced himself to <i>Draupadī</i>, who offered him water for washing his feet, and promised him fifty animals for breakfast and various kinds of deer, etc., etc. (enumerated), when <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> returned. <i>Jayadratha</i> asked her to leave the miserable <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and become his wife (III, <b>267</b>), but was severely rebuked by <i>Draupadī</i>, who threatened him with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. As <i>Jayadratha</i> said, “We too belong by birth to the seventeen high clans, and look down upon the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>,” she threatened him with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, and the <i>Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis</i>, and <i>Kaikeyas</i>, and called upon <i>Dhaumya. Jayadratha</i> seized her by her upper garment; <i>Draupadī</i> pushed him so that he fell upon the ground; but at last she was obliged to ascend his chariot, while <i>Dhaumya</i> followed amidst <i>Jayadratha's</i> infantry (III, <b>268</b>). When the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> again met, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> knew from the shrill cries of the birds that the forest had been invaded by hostile intruders, and he caused them to give up the chase and drive home on their great chariots drawn by <i>Saindhava</i> horses. A yellow jackal on their left indicated the violence done. <i>Indrasena</i> learned what had happened from the weeping foster-sister of <i>Draupadī</i>, and then they pursued and overtook <i>Jayadratha</i>, who was greatly alarmed (III, <b>269</b>). <i>Draupadī</i>, asked by <i>Jayadratha</i>, pointed out to him each of the five <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and advised him to throw down his arms and seek the protection of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, at the top of whose flagstaff two tabours called <i>Nanda</i> and <i>Upananda</i> are constantly played. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, leaving the panic-stricken infantry alone, rushed upon the charioteers [so PCR., who seems to have read <i>rathānīkaṃ</i>, which is, to be sure, the right reading, instead of <i>yathānīkaṃ</i>, which occurs both in C. and B.] (III, <b>270</b>). <i>Bhīma</i> with his iron mace (<i>sarvaśaikyāyasīṃ gadāṃ</i>), embossed with gold, rushed towards <i>Jayadratha</i>, who was defended by <i>Koṭikāsya</i>. The <i>Trigarta</i> king, who had killed the four steeds of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with his mace, was himself killed by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who then, together with <i>Indrasena</i>, mounted the chariot of <i>Sahadeva. Nakula</i> killed <i>Kṣemaṅkara</i> and <i>Mahāmukha</i>, and was compelled by the Trigarta king <i>Suratha</i> (whom he killed?) to mount <i>Bhīma's</i> chariot. <i>Bhīma</i> put <i>Koṭikāsya</i> to flight and slew him. <i>Arjuna</i> killed the twelve <i>Sauvīra</i> heroes, etc.; <i>Jayadratha</i> put <i>Draupadī</i> down and fled. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, seeing <i>Draupadī</i> and <i>Dhaumya</i> walking in front, caused her to be taken up on the chariot of <i>Sahadeva</i>. <i>Arjuna</i> advised <i>Bhīma</i> to refrain from slaying the remnant of the <i>Saindhava</i> host. <i>Bhīma</i> prevailed upon <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to return to the hermitage with the twins and <i>Draupadī</i> and <i>Dhaumya</i>, while he himself would find out and slay <i>Jayadratha. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> entreated him not to slay him, remembering <i>Duḥśalā</i> and <i>Gāndhārī</i>; but <i>Draupadī</i> indignantly required that he should be slain, and <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> went in search of him. In the hermitage <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> found <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> and many other <i>brahmans</i> and ascetics, who were greatly bewailing the lot of <i>Draupadī</i>. Meanwhile <i>Arjuna</i> killed the horses of <i>Jayadratha</i>, though they were a full <i>krośa</i> ahead of him. <i>Jayadratha</i> was then overtaken by <i>Bhīma</i>, but <i>Arjuna</i> entreated <i>Bhīma</i> not to kill him (III, <b>271</b>)."
