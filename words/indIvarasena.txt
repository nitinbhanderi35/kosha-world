As they had no children, the distressed King with his queens worshipped the goddess Durgā. Durgā gave the King two fruits. She blessed that the queens would bear children when they ate the fruits. Adhikasaṃgamā ate both the fruits without showing them to the other wife. Two sons were born to her. Indīvarasena was the elder son. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratnaprabhā laṃbaka, 8th Taraṅga)."
