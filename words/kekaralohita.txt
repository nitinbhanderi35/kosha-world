Cyavana, after worshipping Śiva at Nakuleśvara tīrtha got into river Narmadā to take his bath when the nāga called Kekaralohita caught hold of him, dragged him and bit him. As the sage meditated upon Viṣṇu the poison did not affect him. The serpent released him from Pātāla as he was unaffected by poison. Cyavana went to the palace of Prahlāda accompanied by nāga damsels. On the request of Prahlāda Cyavana described to him the holy places on earth, and without any delay Prahlāda came to earth for hunting during which sojourn on earth he visited Naimiṣāraṇya. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 8)."
