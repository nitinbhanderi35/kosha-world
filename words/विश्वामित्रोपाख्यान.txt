The mother exchanged both the trees and the <i>carus. Ṛcīka</i> had placed the entire <i>brahman</i>-energy in <i>Satyavatī's caru</i> and the <i>kṣatriya</i>-energy in that of her mother; “therefore, thy mother will give birth to an excellent brahman and thou to a terrible <i>kṣatriya</i>.” <i>Satyavatī</i> prevailed upon him, that not her son, but her son's son should be such. Then, by the favour of <i>Ṛcīka</i>, she gave birth to <i>Jamadagni</i>, and the wife of <i>Gādhi</i> to the Brahmarṣi (read <i>brahmarṣiṃ</i>) <i>Viśvāmitra</i>, versed in the <i>Vedas (brahmavādinaṃ). Viśvāmitra</i> attained to the state of a brahman, and became the founder of a race of brahmans. <i>Madhucchanda</i>, etc., (β), were all sons of <i>Viśvāmitra</i> (XIII, <b>4</b>)."
