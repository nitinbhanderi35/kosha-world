Only those facts, which have not been so related are given hereunder.) <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>A brief biographical sketch.</i> Sahadeva was the son of Pāṇḍu by his wife Mādrī. Two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva were born to Mādrī by the Aśvinīdevas. Along with Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma and Arjuna, sons of Kuntī, Nakula and Sahadeva spent their childhood in the company of Sages at Śataśṛṅga mountain. Pāṇḍu died and Mādrī followed him in the funeral pyre. After that the Pāṇḍavas lived at Hastināpura under the care of Kuntī. When the ‘lac-palace’ was burnt down, they took themselves to the forest and ruled the kingdom with Indraprastha as capital. The Pāṇḍavas, who were defeated in the game of dice went again into the forest. Their going into the forest has been described as follows by Vidura. <dvsn n='NI'/>Yudhiṣṭhira, covering his face with cloth and Bhīma stretching out his powerful hands moved into the forest. Arjuna followed them throwing up sand particles. Sahadeva went rubbing his face with earth, Nakula, the most handsome of men, followed them, his body smeared with dust. Pāñcālī, her face concealed in hair and weeping went behind the king. Sage Dhaumya with Kuśa grass in his hands, accompanied them chanting Vedic hymns. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 80). <dvsn n='NI'/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Vidura why the Pāṇḍavas assumed these different poses and attitudes and Vidura answered him thus: Yudhiṣṭhira covered his face to show that he would not retaliate in anger though he had lost the kingdom due to cheating. Bhīma stretched out his hands to show that he was unrivalled in manual power. Arjuna threw out sand to say that he would shoot his arrows into the enemy camp like particles of sand. Sahadeva rubbed earth on his face as he did not want anybody to distinguish his face. Nakula, the most handsome of men, smeared his face with dust so that, on the way, women should not desire him. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the Pāṇḍavas returned after twelve years' stay in exile in the forest and one year's stay incognito Duryodhana refused to allot them even a single house, and war for eighteen days between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas was fought in the field of Kurukṣetra. The Kauravas were wiped out. Yudhiṣṭhira became king and performed the Rajasūyayajña after which the Pāṇḍavas went out on the great journey and gave up their lives. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Other information about Sahadeva.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) He was dedicated to the service of elders.
