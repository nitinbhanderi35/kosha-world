[Page348-b] It is <ab>prob.</ab> connected with <lang>AMg.</lang> purima as cited by <ls>Sheth</ls> (as a <lang>Deśī</lang> word) from Ohaṇijjutti 〔265〕 (I have not found it in <ls>Ratnach.</ls>) cha ppurimā nava khoḍā; the word khoḍa = <i>cleansing</i> a part of a garment (see <ls>Ratnach.</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>), and <ls>Sheth</ls> says purima, like khoḍa, is a part of the Jain cleansing ceremony, (prasphoṭana or) pratilekhana. If <i>cleaning</i> is the <ab>mg.</ab>, our <ab>cpd.</ab> would perhaps mean <i>professional cleaners</i> (of clothes). I have no access to the Ohaṇijjutti."
