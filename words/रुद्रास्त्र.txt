            "content": "<b>Rudrāstra, Raudra astra</b>¦ nt.: Name of a missile, special to Rudra (Śiva). <b>A.</b> Description: Heavenly (<i>divya</i>) 12. 5. 13-14; great (<i>mahāstra</i>) 3. 170. 38; fierce (<i>ghora</i>) 3. 170. 40; 7. 53. 43; eternal (<i>sanātana</i>) 3. 170. 40; destroyer of all enemies (<i>sarvāmitravināśana</i>) 3. 170. 38; no other weapon superior to it (<i>anuttama</i>) 8. 66. 57. <b>B.</b> Identified with the Pāśupata (and the Brahmaśiras ?): When Arjuna prayed to Śiva to give him the divine missiles, he agreed to Arjuna's request and told him that his Raudra missile would wait on him; he then gave him his Pāśupata 3. 163. 47-48; Brahmaśiras missile, which Arjuna received from Rudra, also called Raudra (or adj. ‘fierce’ of Brahmaśiras (?)) 3. 41. 8. <b>C.</b> Known to Arjuna: Arjuna's collection of missiles (<i>astragrāma</i> 5. 166. 32) included Raudra astra 3. 89. 10-11; Arjuna had received it from Rudra 7. 53. 43; 12. 5. 13-14, and he wanted to use it against the Kauravas at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 56. 14. <b>D.</b> Mode of use: At the time of using it (against Karṇa), Arjuna recited the <i>mantras (anu-</i> <i>mantrya)</i> on the arrow on which he employed it 8. 66. 58; at the time of charging his arrow with the missile (to release it against the Pauloma and the Kālakeya demons) Arjuna bowed down to Rudra (<i>rudrāya</i> <i>praṇato raṇe</i>) and wished well to the creatures (<i>svasti bhūtebhyaḥ</i>); he bowed down to Śarva (Rudra) again when he actually released the missile from the bow (<i>namaskṛtvā</i> <i>trinetrāya śarvāyāmitatejase</i>) 3. 170. 38, 41. <b>E.</b> Uses: 1. In the epic war: (i) Arjuna wanted to employ it on a heavenly arrow, resembling fire or snake's poison and which was hard like a stone, and release it against Kaṛṇa 8. 66. 58-59; there is no mention of Arjuna having released it, but it seems that he warded off Karṇa's Brahmāstra with it (not named; <i>tad astram astreṇāvārya praja-</i> <i>hārāsya pāṇḍavaḥ</i>) 8. 67. 8; (ii) Aśvatthāman killed the followers of Dhṛṣṭadyumna who surrounded him after he killed Dhṛṣṭadyumna at night in the camp of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 8. 31-32; 2. Outside the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it to burn with its fire the Nivātakavaca demons 5. 136. 7; (ii) Arjuna used it to kill the Pauloma and the Kālakeya demons; Arjuna first used all his other missiles without being able to defeat the demons, but was himself oppressed by them; at that time he was afraid; he bowed to Rudra and employed the great Raudra missile on his arrow (<i>mahā-</i> <i>straṃ samayojayam</i>); he then saw a man having three heads, nine eyes, three mouths, six hands, burning, his hair bright like the sun or fire, his head covered with big snakes (<i>tato 'paśyaṃ triśirasaṃ puruṣaṃ navaloca-</i> <i>nam / trimukhaṃ ṣaḍbhujaṃ dīptam arka-</i> <i>jvalanamūrdhajam // lelihānair mahānāgaiḥ</i> <i>kṛtaśīrṣam</i>) 3. 170. 38-39; when the missile was next actually released (<i>muktamātre tatas</i> <i>tasmin</i>) thousands of different shapes—wild animals like lions, tigers, bears, buffalos, as also snakes, cows, elephants, <i>sṛmaras,</i> <i>śarabhas,</i> bulls, boars, wild cats, <i>śālāvṛkas,</i> ghosts, <i>bhuruṇḍas,</i> vultures, eagles, crocodiles, Piśācas, Yakṣas, demons, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas, big fishes having mouths of elephants, owls, hosts of fishes and tortoises, shapes holding different weapons and swords, Yātudhānas holding <i>gadā</i> and <i>mudgara,</i> and many others—came out from the missile and filled the space; the demons were killed by many shapes having three heads, four tusks, four mouths, four hands, as also by the arrows of Arjuna which shone like the sun and the fire, which were brilliant like the Vajra and lightning, and hard like rocks; when the demons were killed by the Raudrāstra, Arjuna bowed down to Tripuraghna (Śiva) once again 3. 170. 42-51."
