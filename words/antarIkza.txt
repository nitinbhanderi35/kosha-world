Nābhi wedded Merudevī, and to them were born 100 sons. The eldest son was Bharata, after whom this country (India) is named, i.e., Bhārata. Bhārata had 9 younger brothers, namely Kuśāvarta, Ilāvarta, Brahmāvarta, Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indraspṛk, Vidarbha and Kīkaṭa. <F>*) Rāmānuja's Bhāgavata (Malayalam) mentions one Āryāvarta also as Bharata's younger brother.
