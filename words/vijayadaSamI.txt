As this festival is celebrated for nine nights from the 1st to the 9th in the bright lunar fortnight of the month of Kanni (September-October) it is known as Navarātri (Nine nights) and as it continues up to Daśamī (the tenth night) it is called Dasra. The Hindus believe that the Vijayadaśamī (the victorious tenth) was the day on which Devī Durgā killed Mahiṣāsura and got victory. So this day is considered to be a suitable moment to begin the learning of all the arts which would enable one to carry on a successful life. Sarasvatī is considered the transfiguration of Durgā. As people became less superstitious, they began to consider the story of killing Mahiṣāsura as a metaphorical saying, to mean the killing of ignorance. So the day of victory of Devī Durgā (the same as Sarasvatī) is considered to be the auspicious moment for the beginning of learning. The warrior places his weapons, the man of literature his books and pen, the musician his musical instruments, at the feet of Devī and with devotion and worship receives them back from Devī on the Vijayadaśamī day at an auspicious moment. <dvsn n='NI'/>This is a festival celebrated everywhere in India. In several native states this festival used to be celebrated under the sponsorship of the royal family as a State festival. As it is believed that Mahiṣāsura had lived in Mysore the celebration of Dasra in that State generally is on a grand scale. In Kerala, from olden times this festival was celebrated under the patronage of the Vañci Royal family."
