It is described in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundarakāṇḍa, Sarga 14 and Araṇyakāṇḍa, Sarga 56 and in Mahābhārata also:— <dvsn n='NI'/>“Thinking of her husband alone, clad in the garments of a hermit woman, eating only roots and fruits, in prayer and fast, in sorrow and sadness, she of the wide eyes lived in the Aśoka park which seemed as a hermitage.” (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Araṇya Parva Chapter 280, Stanzas 42 and 43)."
