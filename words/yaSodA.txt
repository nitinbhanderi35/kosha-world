How she became Śrī Kṛṣṇa's fostermother, is explained in a story given in Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha:— <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Droṇa, one of the Aṣṭavasus, and his wife Dharā, caused displeasure to Brahmā. In his anger, Brahmā cursed them to be born in the world as human beings and to spend a life-time on earth, tending cattle. Droṇa became sad and with tears in his eyes, prayed to Brahmā that during his life on earth he should be blessed with Viṣṇu's darśana. Brahmā granted that prayer. It was in fulfilment of this prayer that Droṇa was born as Nandagopa and Dharā as Yaśodā in Ambāḍi."
