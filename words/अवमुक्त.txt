Its ruler was Nīlarāja.<sup>529</sup>. Avamukta has not been identified with certainty. Some scholars on the basis of the similarity of names identify it with Avimukta another name of Kāśī.<sup>530</sup> But the suggestion cannot be accepted. Avamukta of the inscription was a country in the South while Avimukta or Kāśī is an eastern country. It may be considered to be situated in the Godavari district.<sup>531</sup> According to D.B. Diskalkar it must lay on the Eastern Ghāṭs which lie to the west of Kāñcī or Conjeevaram.<sup>532</sup>"
