E. 113 is inscribed was set up by Śāmāḍhyā (Śyāmāḍhyā), the daughter of Bhaṭṭibhava. Bhaṭṭibhava seems to have been a brāhmaṇa-follower of Jainism. Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi, a surname meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhaṭṭi is the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’ means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord Śiva. Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.<sup>30</sup> Thus the full name literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his teacher’. It can also be a case of a name after the deity ‘Bhava’ or ‘Śiva’."
