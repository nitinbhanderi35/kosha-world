This Bṛhadratha was a mighty warrior-king with an army of three akṣauhiṇīs (an akṣauhiṇi is a complete army consisting of 21870 horses and 109350 infantry). Though he had married two daughters of the King of Kāśi he was childless. The sorrowful king went with his wives to a hermit named Caṇḍakauśika and pleased him by giving him precious stones. The King told the hermit about his sorrow due to lack of children. The hermit gave them a mango fruit and said that the King should enthrone the son who would be born by eating the mango, and return to the forest for penance. The hermit gave eight boons for the son who was to be born. <dvsn n='NI'/>The King and his wives returned to the palace and divided the mango fruit into two and both of his wives ate the fruit and became pregnant. Each of them gave birth to half of a child. The lifeless forms of these half children were thrown out. A giantess called Jarā put them together and instantly the pieces joined together and became a living child. The giantess took that child and made a present of it to the King. That child grew up and was known by the famous name Jarāsandha. From that time onwards Giantess-worship began in Magadha. When Jarāsandha came of age the King anointed him as King and went to the hermitage of Caṇḍakauśika with his wives and began to do penance. After coming to the forest Bṛhadratha killed a giant named Ṛṣabha and with his hide made three Big drums and placed them in the city. The sound of one beat on the drum will last for a month. When Bhīma, Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to Magadha to kill Jarāsandha they broke these drums. (M.B. Ādi Parva, 53; Sabhā Parva, Chapters 17, 19 and 21)."
