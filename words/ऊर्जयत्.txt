We also get support for our suggestion from the fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsikatā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat<sup>104</sup> in Inscription No. 14 the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.<sup>105</sup> Fleet<sup>106</sup> and Sircar<sup>107</sup> are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill different from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sanctified by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathiawad).<sup>108</sup> In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century) verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names Ujjayanata and Raivata.<sup>109</sup> The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as synonyms.<sup>110</sup> The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).<sup>111</sup> The mountain Ūrjayat is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.<sup>112</sup> The literal meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.<sup>113</sup>"
