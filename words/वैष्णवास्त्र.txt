The Earth (<i>Pṛthivī</i>), knowing that that time had come, asked of him as a boon for [her son] <i>Naraka</i>, that he, possessed of the <i>Vaiṣṇavāstra</i>, should become incapable of being slain by gods and Asuras. The boon was granted. From <i>Naraka</i>, the king of <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> (i.e. Bhagadatta) got this weapon, that may slay even <i>Indra</i> and <i>Rudra</i>: VII, <b>29</b>, 1284, [1285 (<i>astraṃ…Vaiṣṇavaṃ</i>)]."

(sg.; pl. 3. 164. 30) Name of a missile belonging to Viṣṇu (<i>tad astraṃ pārtha</i> <i>māmakam</i> 7. 28. 33). <b>A.</b> History: In the bygone days, Earth (<i>pṛthivī, jagatī, kṣamā</i>) asked for her son Naraka the following boon from the fourth form of Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) which wakes up once after thousand years: “May he be equipped with the Vaiṣṇavāstra so that he cannot be killed by the gods and the Asuras”; accordingly Viṣṇu gave the missile to Naraka and said: “May this missile be unfailing in protecting Naraka; no one shall kill him; protected by the missile, Naraka will be unassailable in the worlds for all times”; from Naraka, the missile went to Prāgjyotiṣa (Bhagadatta) 7. 28. 26-33. <b>B.</b> Description: heavenly (<i>divya</i>) 6. 116. 38; great missile (<i>paramāstra</i>) 7. 28. 34; unfailing (<i>amogha</i>) 7. 28. 29, 30; killer of all (<i>sarvaghātaka</i>) 7. 28. 17. <b>C.</b> Knowledge: Indra told Arjuna to go to his residence in the heaven to learn all the Vaiṣṇava missiles (<i>vaiṣṇavāni ca sarvāṇi</i>) together with other heavenly missiles 3. 164. 29-30; according to Bhīṣma, all the heavenly missiles including the Vaiṣṇava astra, known to Arjuna and perhaps to Kṛṣṇa, and to no one else in the world of the mortals (<i>sarvasmin</i> <i>mānuṣe loke vetty eko hi dhanaṃjayaḥ /</i> <i>kṛṣṇo vā devakīputro nānyo vai veda</i> <i>kaścana</i>) 6. 116. 38-39. <b>D.</b> Use in the epic war: Bhagadatta, wishing to release the Vaiṣṇavāstra (<i>udīrayan</i>) recited <i>mantras (abhimantrya)</i> on his hook (<i>aṅkuśa</i>) and hurled it aiming it on Arjuna's chest; Kṛṣṇa covered Arjuna and received the missile on his chest, where it turned into the garland Vaijayantī 7. 28. 16-18; since there was no one in the worlds, including even Indra and Rudra, who could not be killed by the missile, Kṛṣṇa covered Arjuna to save him (<i>nāsyāvadhyo 'sti lokeṣu sendrarudreṣu</i> <i>māriṣa</i>) 7. 28. 33-34."
