There is a story to support the presence of this evil power within the above four. Indra once turned the Aśvinīdevas out of his court labelling them as outcastes and banned wine to them. Discontented at this the Aśvinīdevas approached Cyavana and the latter performing a yāga invited the Aśvinīdevas and gave them the yāga wine, ‘Soma’. Infuriated at this Indra raised his celebrated Vajrāyudha (Weapon of thunder) to kill Cyavana. But the sage by his yogic powers paralysed the hands of Indra and instantly from the sacrificial fire there arose Mada a genie to kill Indra. Frightened by this sight Indra fell at the feet of Cyavana and craved for pardon. The sage then tore the genie into four pieces and threw one each into dice, hunting, wine and women. That is why all the four are as alluring as destructive. (Saptama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata)."
