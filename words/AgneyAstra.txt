Arjuna then described to him how he came into possession of this missile. This powerful missile was given first to Bhāradvāja by Bṛhaspati and Bharadvāja gave it to Agniveśya who in turn gave it to Droṇa and the latter gave it to Arjuna, his most favourite disciple. (Ślokas 29-30, Chapter 170, Ādi Parva, M.B.)."
