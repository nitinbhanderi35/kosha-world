Suvarcas later on became famous as Karandhama. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>How he got his name Karandhama.</i> Once there came a famine in the country of Suvarcas. The treasury became empty. Taking that opportunity the enemies attacked his country. There was no army for him to fight against his enemies. Meditating upon God he blew his hands and then an army sufficient to fight his enemies appeared before him and using that he defeated them. Because he arranged an army by Karadhamana (blowing of hands) he was given the name of Karandhamana also. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Other details.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(i) The celebrated King Avikṣit was the son of Karandhama.
