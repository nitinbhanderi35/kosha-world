He had 100 sons. <i>Indra</i> began to look for an occasion against him. Once, on a hunting expedition, he was bewildered by <i>Indra</i>, and, afflicted with thirst, he plunged into a lake after having caused his horse to drink, and found himself changed into a woman. He took leave of his wives and children and retired to the woods, joined an ascetic and bore him 100 sons, whom he took to his former children, and made them all enjoy the kingdom as their joint property. Filled with rage, <i>Indra</i>, in the form of a brahman, repaired to <i>Bhaṅgāsvana's</i> capital, and, referring them to the example of the gods and the <i>Asuras</i> (the children of <i>Kaśyapa</i>), caused the half-brothers to slay each other. Then, in the form of a brahman, he came to the spot where <i>Bhaṅgāsvana</i> lived as an ascetic lady, afflicted with grief, and told him that he was <i>Indra</i>, and why he was angry, but was gratified and granted him a boon. He asked that those sons of his should revive that were born by him as a woman, because the affection entertained by a woman is much greater than that which is entertained by a man. <i>Indra</i> revived all his children, and told him to choose whichever sex he liked, that of woman or that of man. He chose to remain a woman, because in sexual intercourse the pleasure that women enjoy is always much greater than what is enjoyed by men. <i>Indra</i> proceeded to heaven (XIII, <b>12</b>)."
