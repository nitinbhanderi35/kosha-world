Bhīṣmavadha). § 577: Beholding <i>Arjuna</i> again taking up the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Somakas</i> were filled with joy and blew their conches, etc. D., G., P., Si., Cā., and Ṛ. came with <i>Indra</i> in order to behold the fight. Putting off his coat of mail, etc., <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, followed by his brothers (α) (who did not know his intentions) and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, proceeded on foot, with joined hands, to <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (β), one after another, and asked their permission to fight. He also inquired about the means of vanquishing <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, and as they said that they were invincible he asked them to indicate the means of killing them. They gave the permission, said they would pray for his victory, though they were bound by the wealth of the <i>Kurus</i> to fight for them. <i>Bhīṣma</i> said that his time of death had not yet come, he must come to see him once more. <i>Droṇa</i> said that if he did not give himself up to death and drop his weapons nobody would be able to slay him; he would drop his arms if he heard something very disagreeable from someone whose speech was trustworthy. <i>Kṛpa</i> said he was incapable of being slain. <i>Śalya</i> renewed his promise to weaken the energy of <i>Karṇa</i>. When the <i>Kauravas</i> saw <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, they contemned him, believing that he had come in terror. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> endeavoured to bring <i>Karṇa</i> over to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, as long as <i>Bhīṣma</i> was not slain, but in vain. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> exclaimed, “He who chooses us, him we will choose for our ally”; <i>Yuyutsu</i> went over to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said that the propagation of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> lineage and his śrāddha oblations rested on him. The <i>Mlecchas</i> and <i>Aryans</i> wept for joy at the behaviour of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and blew their conches, etc. (VI, <b>43</b>).—§ 578: THE FIRST DAY'S ENCOUNTER: <i>Duḥśāsana</i> advanced with his troops with <i>Bhīṣma</i> at their head, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> headed by <i>Bhīmasena</i>, who roared frightfully. <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (α), attacked <i>Bhīmasena</i>. The <i>Draupadeyas</i>, etc. (β), rushed against the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>. The disciples of <i>Droṇa</i> always hit the mark (VI, <b>44</b>). (1) <i>Bhīṣma</i> attacked <i>Arjuna</i>; (2) <i>Sātyaki</i> attacked <i>Kṛta—</i> <i>varman</i>; (3) <i>Abhimanyu</i> fought with <i>Bṛhadbala</i>; (4) <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena</i> struggled with <i>Duryodhana</i>; (5) <i>Duḥśāsana</i> fought with <i>Nakula</i>; (6) <i>Durmukha</i> fought with <i>Sahadeva</i>; (7) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> fought with the <i>Madra</i> king (<i>Śalya</i>); (8) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> attacked <i>Droṇa</i>; (9) <i>Śaṅkha</i> encountered <i>Somadatta's</i> son; (10) <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i> (the king of the <i>Cedis</i>) encountered <i>Bāhlīka</i>, they looked like the planets <i>Aṅgāraka</i> (Mars) and <i>Budha</i> (Mercury); (11) <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> encountered <i>Alambuṣa</i>; (12) <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i> encountered <i>Aśvatthāman</i>; (13) <i>Virāṭa</i> attacked <i>Bhagadatta</i>; (14) <i>Kṛpa</i> attacked the <i>Kaikeya</i> king <i>Bṛhatkṣattra</i>; (15) <i>Drupada</i> attacked the <i>Sindhu</i> king <i>Jayadratha</i>, they resembled the planets <i>Śukra</i> (Venus) and <i>Aṅgāraka</i> (Mars); (16) <i>Vikarṇa</i> (son of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>) attacked <i>Sutasoma</i>; (17) <i>Cekitāna</i>, who sided with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, attacked <i>Suśarman</i>; (18) <i>Śakuni</i> attacked <i>Prati-</i> <i>vindhya</i>; (19) <i>Śrutakarman</i> (the son of <i>Sahadeva</i>) attacked the <i>Kāmboja</i> king <i>Sudakṣiṇa</i>, and stood like the <i>Maināka</i> mountain; (20) <i>Irāvat</i> (son of <i>Arjuna</i>) attacked <i>Śrutāyus</i>; (21) the two princes of <i>Avanti, Vinda</i> and <i>Anuvinda</i>, encountered <i>Kuntibhoja</i> with his son; (22) the <i>Kekaya-</i>brothers encountered the five <i>Gāndhāra-</i>princes; (23) <i>Vīrabāhu</i> (son of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>) encountered <i>Uttara</i> (the son of <i>Virāṭa</i>); (24) The <i>Cedi</i> king attacked <i>Ulūka</i>. Thousands of single combats took place. D.-ṛ., Si., and Cā. beheld the battle, which resembled the combat of D. and As. (VI, <b>45</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Kurus</i> fought as if they were possessed by demons. The divisions of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, approaching <i>Bhīṣma</i> (<i>b</i>), began to yield (VI, <b>46</b>). (25) After the greater part of the forenoon had worn out, <i>Durmukha</i>, etc. (γ), began to protect <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who rushed upon the <i>Cedis</i>, etc. (δ). (26) Then <i>Abhimanyu (c</i>) attacked <i>Bhīṣma, Kṛtavarman, Śalya</i>, <i>Durmukha</i> (cutting off the head of his charioteer), and <i>Kṛpa</i> (cutting in two his bow); he was regarded as equal to <i>Arjuna</i>, and his bow sent forth a twang like that of the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>; he stood firm like the <i>Maināka</i> mountain. When <i>Bhīṣma's</i> standard fell down, <i>Bhīma</i> shouted. <i>Bhīṣma</i> used celestial weapons. (27) In order to protect <i>Abhimanyu</i>, <i>Virāṭa</i>, etc. (ε), attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who wounded <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i>, and they cut off the standard of <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena (d</i>), who wounded <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i>. (28) Mounted on an elephant, <i>Uttara</i> (the son of <i>Virāṭa</i>) attacked the <i>Madra</i> king <i>Śalya</i>, whose steeds were killed by the elephant; <i>Śalya</i>, with a dart, deprived <i>Uttara</i> of his senses, and mounted the chariot of <i>Kṛtavarman</i>. (29) Seeing his brother <i>Uttara</i> slain and <i>Śalya</i> staying with <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, <i>Śveta</i> (the son of <i>Virāṭa</i>) attacked <i>Śalya</i>. (30) The <i>Kosala</i> king <i>Bṛhadbala</i>, etc. (ζ), attacked <i>Śveta</i> in order to protect <i>Śalya; Śveta</i> wounded <i>Rukmaratha</i>, who was borne away by his charioteer. (31) Then <i>Duryodhana</i>, with <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc., attacked <i>Śveta</i> and rescued <i>Śalya; Bhīṣma</i> shot at <i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc. (η) (VI, <b>47</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, with <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, desired to rescue the generalissimo <i>Śveta</i> and attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>. The <i>Kurus</i> retreated from fear, and abandoned <i>Bhīṣma</i>. (32) <i>Duryodhana</i> averted <i>Śveta</i> from <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and was routed; (33) <i>Śveta</i> once more attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>, whose standard he cut down; (34) then <i>Bāhlīka</i>, etc. (θ), attacked <i>Śveta</i> in order to protect <i>Bhīṣma</i>, whose chariot <i>Śveta</i> reduced to ashes, with standard, etc.; (35) <i>Śalya</i>, etc., rushed to <i>Bhīṣma's</i> rescue; a voice in the skies admonished <i>Bhīṣma</i> to hasten the death of <i>Śveta</i>. (36) <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (κ), rushed to the rescue of <i>Śveta. Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (λ), checked them. With a shaft endued with the force of the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon, seen by D., G., P., U., and Rā., <i>Bhīṣma</i> shot <i>Śveta</i> to death. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (with <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>) lamented; the <i>Kurus</i> rejoiced; <i>Duḥśāsana</i> danced for joy. <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> withdrew the troops, the same did the <i>Kurus</i> (VI, <b>48</b>). (37) When <i>Śveta</i> had been slain, <i>Virāṭa's</i> son <i>Śaṅkha</i>, on beholding <i>Śalya</i> standing with <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, attacked <i>Śalya</i>; (38) <i>Bhīṣma</i> attacked <i>Śaṅkha</i>; (39) <i>Arjuna</i> placed himself in front of <i>Śaṅkha</i> and attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>; (40) <i>Śalya</i>, mace in hand, slew the steeds of <i>Śaṅkha</i>, who mounted <i>Arjuna's</i> chariot. (41) <i>Bhīṣma</i> with his arrows slaughtered the <i>Pāñcāla</i> hosts, etc. (μ), abandoned <i>Arjuna</i>, and attacked <i>Drupada</i>. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were routed, the sun set, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> withdrew their forces (VI, <b>49</b>). Seeing <i>Bhīṣma's</i> (and <i>Droṇa's</i>) prowess, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> complained before <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and spoke of retiring into the woods. <i>Bhīma</i> alone, he said, fought in accordance with <i>kṣattriya</i> duties; <i>Arjuna</i> was indifferent. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> consoled him, saying that he had got <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ν), and that <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i> was certainly the slayer of <i>Bhīṣma. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> then addressed <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, saying that he himself and <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (ξ), would follow him. <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> said that he had been appointed by <i>Śambhu</i> to slay <i>Droṇa</i> and to fight against <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ο). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> recommended the array called <i>Krauñcāruṇa</i>, which <i>Bṛhaspati</i> had explained to <i>Indra</i> in days of old, when the gods and the <i>Asuras</i> fought, but which had never been seen before. When morning dawned, <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> placed <i>Arjuna</i> (<i>e</i>) in the van of the army, and <i>Drupada</i> became the head [of the array], etc. (π) (VI, <b>50</b>). Seeing the <i>Krauñca</i> of the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Duryodhana</i>, approaching <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ρ), gladdened them all, saying that their army, which was protected by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, was immeasurable, while that of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, protected by <i>Bhīma</i>, was measurable. The <i>Saṃsthānas</i>, etc. (σ), should protect <i>Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma</i>, <i>Droṇa</i>, and the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> formed a mighty array. <i>Bhīṣma</i> was followed by <i>Droṇa</i> with the <i>Kuntalas</i>, etc. (τ). <i>Śakuni</i> protected <i>Droṇa</i>. Followed by his brothers and the <i>Aśvātakas</i>, etc. (υ), <i>Duryodhana</i> advanced against the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> host. <i>Bhūriśravas</i>, etc. (ϕ), protected the left flank; <i>Somadatta</i>, etc. (χ), the right; <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (ψ), were in the rear; behind them <i>Ketumat</i>, etc. (ω). <i>Bhīṣma</i> and the others blew their conches, etc. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (αα), blew their conches (<i>Kṛṣṇa</i> blew <i>Pāñcajanya</i>, etc.). The <i>Kurus</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> marched against each other in order to renew the battle (VI, <b>51</b>).—§ 579: SECOND DAY: <i>Duryodhana</i> began the battle. (1) <i>Bhīṣma</i> shot at <i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc. (α); <i>Arjuna</i> told <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to take his chariot before <i>Bhīṣma</i>; “protected by <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, etc. (β), will slaughter the <i>Pāñcālas</i>.” Only <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Karṇa</i> could encounter <i>Arjuna. Bhīṣma</i> was protected by <i>Saindhava</i> (i.e. Jayadratha), etc. (γ). <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (δ), struck <i>Arjuna</i>, who struck <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ε). <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ζ), surrounded <i>Arjuna</i>. (2) The <i>Pāñcāla</i> prince and the <i>Somakas</i> attacked <i>Droṇa</i>. (3) <i>Bhīṣma</i> fought with <i>Arjuna</i>, at the request of <i>Duryodhana</i>, who complained of the absence of <i>Karṇa</i>; <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (η), stood for battle; <i>Bhīṣma</i> wounded <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>; D., G., Cā., and great Ṛ. said they would be invincible by all the worlds with D., As., and G. (4) See 2 (VI, <b>52</b>): Continuation of the combat between <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>. (5) <i>Bhīma</i> attacked <i>Droṇa</i> in order to aid <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, whom he caused to be taken up on another chariot. (6) Urged by <i>Duryodhana</i>, the <i>Kaliṅga</i> king rushed against <i>Bhīma</i> in order to protect <i>Droṇa</i>. (7) <i>Droṇa</i> abandoned <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and encountered <i>Virāṭa</i> and <i>Dru-</i> <i>pada</i>. (8) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> proceeded to support <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. (9) See 6 (VI, <b>53</b>): <i>Bhīmasena</i> was supported by the <i>Cedis</i>; the <i>Kaliṅga</i> king by <i>Ketumat</i> (son of the <i>Niṣāda</i> king; <i>rāja-</i> <i>putraḥ</i>, v. 2354) and <i>Śrutāyus</i>. The <i>Cedis</i>, etc. (θ), attacked the <i>Niṣādas</i>. (10) The <i>Cedis</i> left <i>Bhīmasena</i> and turned back; the <i>Kaliṅga</i> king and his son <i>Śakradeva</i> fought with <i>Bhīma</i>, who slew <i>Śakradeva</i> with his mace. (11) <i>Bhīma</i> attacked <i>Bhānumat</i> (the prince of the <i>Kaliṅgas</i>), and slew him with his sword, dividing him in the middle, and made a great slaughter of men and elephants. (12) Beholding <i>Śrutāyus</i> (the ruler of the <i>Kaliṅgas</i>) at the head of the <i>Kaliṅga</i> troops, <i>Bhīmasena</i> attacked him, was wounded, and taken into his chariot by the charioteer <i>Aśoka</i>; once more he fought with <i>Śrutāyus</i>, and slew him, and <i>Satyadeva</i>, and <i>Satya</i>, and <i>Ketumat</i>, and routed the <i>Kaliṅgas</i>. (13) When, however, the <i>Kaliṅgas</i> were rallied again, <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, with <i>Śikhaṇḍin, Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i>, etc., protected one of the wings of <i>Bhīmasena</i>; there was nobody on earth, save <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i>, who was dearer to <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> than his very life; they beheld <i>Sātyaki</i> at a distance; and that [grand]son of <i>Śini</i> took up the wing of both <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Bhīma</i> caused a bloody river to flow there. (14) <i>Bhīṣma</i> heard the cries, attacked <i>Bhīma</i>, and was attacked by <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Bhīṣma</i> jumped from his chariot, mace in hand, and was taken by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> on his chariot. <i>Sātyaki</i> slew the charioteer of <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who was then carried away from the field of battle by his steeds. The <i>Kaliṅgas</i> were totally routed by <i>Bhīma</i>, who was praised by the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Matsyas</i>, himself embraced <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, and was congratulated by <i>Sātyaki</i>, who returned to his own chariot and began to slay the <i>Kurus</i> (VI, <b>54</b>). (15) When the forenoon of that day had passed away, <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> engaged in battle with <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (κ); he slew the steeds of <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, who got up on <i>Śalya's</i> car. (16) <i>Abhimanyu</i> quickly came up and wounded <i>Śalya</i>, etc. (λ), but was, in his turn, wounded by <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (μ). (17) <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> (the son of <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i>) attacked <i>Abhimanyu</i>. (18) <i>Duryodhana</i> attacked <i>Abhi-</i> <i>manyu</i> in order to aid <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i>. (19) <i>Arjuna</i> engaged in battle with the <i>Kurus</i>, headed by <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>; dust and <i>Abhimanyu's</i> arrows produced complete darkness. The <i>Kurus</i> were routed. <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> blew their conches. <i>Bhīṣma</i> suggested to <i>Droṇa</i> that they should withdraw the troops, and as the sun set both armies were withdrawn (VI, <b>55</b>).— § 580: THIRD DAY; (1) Next morning <i>Bhīṣma</i> formed a <i>Garuḍa</i> array; at its beak was <i>Bhīṣma</i> himself; its eyes were formed by <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman; Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (α), were at its head; <i>Bhūriśravas</i>, etc. (β), were placed in its neck; at its back was <i>Duryodhana</i> and his followers; <i>Vinda</i>, etc. (γ), formed its tail; the <i>Magadhas</i>, etc. (δ), formed the right wing; the <i>Kārūṣas</i>, etc. (ε), were stationed in the left wing. (2) <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> formed an array in the shape of a half-moon, with <i>Bhīmasena</i> in the right horn, etc. (ζ); next to <i>Nīla Dhṛṣṭaketu</i>, etc. (η); in the middle was <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (θ); on the left horn was he who had <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> for his protector. Then the battle commenced (VI, <b>56</b>). (3) <i>Arjuna</i> fought with the <i>Kauravas</i>, who could not be broken, as they were protected by <i>Droṇa</i>; and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> could not be broken, as they were protected by <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Bhīma</i>. At last <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ι), broke the ranks of the <i>Pāṇḍavas. Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (κ), attacked the <i>Kauravas</i> and fought with <i>Duryodhana, Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Droṇa; Abhimanyu</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i> attacked <i>Śakuni</i> (VI, <b>57</b>). D., Dā., G., Pś., U., and Rā. eulogized <i>Arjuna</i>. (4) The <i>Gāndhāras</i>, with <i>Śakuni</i>, fought with <i>Sātyaki</i> (the <i>Vṛṣṇi</i> hero) and <i>Abhimanyu</i>, and destroyed the chariot of <i>Sātyaki</i>, who mounted <i>Abhimanyu's</i> chariot. (5) <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i> attacked <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and were attacked by him and the sons of <i>Mādrī</i>. (6) <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> fought with <i>Duryodhana</i>, who was brought away by his charioteer, and his troops fled, pursued by <i>Bhīma</i>. (7) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> slew <i>Droṇa's</i> and <i>Bhīṣma's</i> army, which fled and could not be checked by by <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>. (8) <i>Abhimanyu</i> and <i>Śaineya</i> began to slaughter the army of <i>Śakuni</i>. (9) <i>Arjuna</i> routed the <i>Kaurava</i> army, and its flight could not be checked by <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, but was checked by <i>Duryodhana</i>, who blamed <i>Bhīṣma</i>, saying that he did not sincerely fight with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, otherwise his troops could not have been routed while <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (λ), were alive; had he known this unwillingness of <i>Bhīṣma</i> to fight, he would have consulted <i>Karṇa. Bhīṣma</i> said that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were incapable of being vanquished by the very gods, including <i>Indra</i>, but he alone would check them to-day (VI, <b>58</b>). (10) After the forenoon of that day had passed away, <i>Bhīṣma</i> attacked the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and a dreadful battle ensued, in which the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were routed. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> told <i>Arjuna</i> to strike <i>Bhīṣma</i>, reminding him of his vow to slay all the warriors of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> son, headed by <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>. At the request of <i>Arjuna</i>, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> drove the steeds to where <i>Bhīṣma</i> was, and the army of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> rallied for battle. <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i> fought; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> displayed great skill in driving the horses; he and <i>Arjuna</i> were both wounded by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army was routed; <i>Bhīṣma</i> ordered <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (μ), to attack <i>Arjuna</i>. (11) The grandson of <i>Śini</i> came to <i>Arjuna's</i> rescue; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> applauded him, and, saying that he would slay <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, etc., he jumped down from the chariot with his discus <i>Sudarśana</i> in his hand, and rushed towards <i>Bhīṣma</i> (who welcomed him), but was held back by <i>Arjuna</i>, who said that he would himself slay the <i>Kurus</i>; he was then prevailed upon to mount the chariot once more, where he blew the <i>Pāñcajanya</i>, while arrows were shot from the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> in all directions. (12) Then <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (ν), attacked <i>Arjuna</i>, who invoked the <i>Māhendra</i> weapon and checked the <i>Kaurava</i> host. (13) <i>Virāṭa, Drupada</i>, etc., approached. <i>Arjuna</i> caused a river of blood to flow there with <i>Rākṣasas</i> on its banks. Elated with victory, the <i>Cedis</i>, etc. (ξ), set up a loud shout. The <i>Kurus</i>, including <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ο), got afraid of the <i>Indra-</i> weapon, and withdrew their forces at sunset. The same did <i>Arjuna</i>. Among the <i>Kurus</i> there was a great uproar: “The <i>Sauvīras</i>, etc. (π), have all been slain by <i>Arjuna</i>, and he has vanquished <i>Śrutāyus</i>, etc. (ρ)” (VI, <b>59</b>).—§ 581: THE FOURTH DAY: (1) When the night had passed away, <i>Bhīṣma</i> at the head of the army proceeded against the foe, surrounded by <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (α). The array of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> was like that of the day before. <i>Bhīṣma (b</i>) attacked <i>Arjuna</i>, and so did <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (β); <i>Abhimanyu</i> rushed out of the ranks and proceeded against all the foes, but <i>Bhīṣma</i> avoided <i>Abhimanyu</i> and fought against <i>Arjuna</i> himself (VI, <b>60</b>). (2) <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (γ), fought with <i>Abhimanyu</i>. (3) Urged by <i>Duryodhana</i>, the <i>Trigartas</i>, etc. (δ), attacked <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Abhimanyu</i>. (4) Proceeding towards <i>Arjuna, Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i> attacked the <i>Madras</i>, etc. (ε), and slew <i>Saṃyamani's</i> son (VI, <b>61</b>). <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> fought with <i>Śalya</i>. (5) <i>Abhimanyu</i> attacked <i>Śalya. Duryodhana</i>, etc. (ζ), protected the chariot of <i>Śalya. Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (η), fought with them. (6) <i>Bhīmasena</i>, with his mace, attacked <i>Duryodhana</i>, who advanced with the <i>Magadha-</i>division, and placing the ruler of <i>Magadha</i> before himself, <i>Bhīmasena</i> jumped from his chariot and slew the elephants with his mace; the <i>Draupadeyas</i>, etc. (θ), protected <i>Bhīma's</i> rear; <i>Abhimanyu</i> slew the <i>Magadha</i> king after having slain his elephant (VI, <b>62</b>). (7) <i>Duryodhana</i> commanded his entire army to slay <i>Bhīmasena</i>, who crushed them with his mace, without being abandoned by <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i>, etc. (ι). (8) <i>Bhīṣma</i> attacked <i>Bhīmasena</i>. (9) <i>Sātyaki</i> (<i>Śinipravīraḥ</i>) attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>. (10) Only the Rā. <i>Alambuṣa</i> fought with the grandson of <i>Śini</i>. (11) Only <i>Somadatta's</i> son <i>Bhūriśravas</i> was then of good cheer; he attacked <i>Sātyaki</i> (VI, <b>63</b>). (12) <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers surrounded <i>Somadatta's</i> son; <i>Bhīmasena</i> encountered the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, who were headed by <i>Duryodhana; Nandaka</i> (Dhārtarāṣṭra) also attacked <i>Bhīmasena</i>, who addressed his charioteer <i>Viśoka</i>, that he should drive the steeds with care; <i>Duryodhana</i> also wounded <i>Viśoka; Duryodhana</i> struck <i>Bhīmasena</i> so that he swooned away. (13) The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army, headed by <i>Abhi-</i> <i>manyu</i>, showered arrows on <i>Duryodhana; Bhīmasena</i> regained consciousness and fought against <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Śalya</i>, who was borne away from the battle. (14) Fourteen <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, viz. <i>Senāpati</i>, etc. (κ), encountered <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena</i>, who slew <i>Senāpati</i>, etc. (λ); the remaining six fled. (15) Urged by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, the whole <i>Dhārtarāṣṭra</i> army attacked <i>Bhīmasena</i>; the <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> king <i>Bhagadatta</i>, on a huge elephant, struck <i>Bhīmasena</i>, who fell in a swoon. (16) Then the Rā. <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, by help of his illusive force, appeared riding on an <i>Airāvata</i>, followed by the other <i>Dig-</i> <i>nāgas</i> (μ), each with four tusks and mounted by <i>Rākṣasas</i>, and attacked <i>Bhagadatta's</i> elephant. (17) <i>Bhīṣma</i> urged <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> to rescue <i>Bhagadatta</i>; all the kings, headed by <i>Droṇa</i>, proceeded to aid <i>Bhagadatta; Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, with the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, pursued them from behind; <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> uttered a flerce roar; <i>Bhīṣma</i>, addressing <i>Droṇa</i>, caused the army to withdraw, and so did the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Ghaṭotkaca. Duryodhana</i> was afflicted with sorrow (VI, <b>64</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> complained to <i>Sañjaya</i>, and asked what was the cause of the victory of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. <i>Sañjaya</i> explained that victory sides with righteousness, and related how <i>Duryodhana</i> in the night had enquired of <i>Bhīṣma</i>, on whom the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were relying to vanquish <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ν). <i>Bhīṣma</i> had related this ancient history: In days of old all the gods and <i>Ṛṣis</i> were assembled by <i>Brahmán</i> upon <i>Gandhamādana</i>; and when <i>Brahmán</i>, together with the <i>Ṛṣis</i> and gods, beheld an excellent chariot in the sky, he hymned <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (ξ). “…Therefore take birth in the race of <i>Yadu</i> and slay the sons of <i>Diti…</i> Having created the divine <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa</i> out of thy own self by thyself, thou didst then, O <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, create thyself as <i>Pradyumna</i>, born of thyself; from <i>Pradyumna</i> thou didst then create <i>Ani-</i> <i>ruddha</i>, who is known as the eternal <i>Viṣṇu</i>; and it was <i>Aniruddha</i> who created me as <i>Brahmán</i>, the upholder of the Universe. Created out of <i>Vāsudeva</i>, I have therefore been created by thee. Dividing thyself into portions, take birth among human beings, and slaughtering the <i>Asuras</i> there …thou wilt again truly attain to <i>Yoga…”</i> (VI, <b>65</b>). Requested by D., R., and G., <i>Brahmán</i> explained to them who <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> is. “Those Dai. and Dā. and Rā. who were slain in battle have been born among men.” The old <i>Ṛṣis Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> are <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa</i> should never be disregarded as if he were a man. This was heard by <i>Bhīṣma</i> from <i>Ṛṣis</i>, etc. (ο). “Never go to war with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; on account of thy folly thou couldst not apprehend this; I regard thee, therefore, as a wicked <i>Rākṣasa</i>.” “Where <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> is, there is righteousness; and victory is where righteousness is…It is <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> who always imparts an understanding endued with righteousness and strength in battle to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and who always protects them from danger…He it is who, towards the close of the <i>Dvāpara yuga</i> and the beginning of the <i>Kali yuga</i>, is hymned by <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa</i> according to the <i>Sātvata</i> ritual” (VI, <b>66</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i>, on the authority of <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i>, declared the origin and glory of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, his deeds and creations, to <i>Duryodhana</i> (π) (VI, <b>67</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> cited a hymn to <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, uttered by <i>Brahmán</i> himself, and communicated in days of old by B.-ṛ. and G. on earth. <i>Brahmán</i>, who quoted <i>Nārada</i>, etc. (ρ), hymned <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> as the god of D., S. etc. (σ) (VI, <b>68</b>).—§ 582: FIFTH DAY: After the night had passed away, <i>Bhīṣma</i> proceeded in a <i>Makara</i> array, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in a <i>Śyena</i> array, in whose beak, etc., was <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (α). (1) <i>Bhīmasena</i>, penetrating the <i>Makara</i> array through its mouth, attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were confounded. (2) Then <i>Arjuna</i> attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>. (3) <i>Duryodhana</i> addressed <i>Droṇa</i>, who attacked <i>Sātyaki</i> (the grandson of <i>Śini</i>). (4) <i>Bhīmasena</i> attacked <i>Droṇa</i> in order to protect <i>Sātyaki</i>. (5) <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (β), attacked <i>Bhīmasena</i>. (6) <i>Abhimanyu</i> and the <i>Draupadeyas</i> attacked the <i>Kurus; Śikhaṇḍin</i> attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa; Bhīṣma</i> avoided him. (7) Urged by <i>Duryodhana, Droṇa</i> protected <i>Bhīṣma; Śikhaṇḍin</i> avoided <i>Droṇa</i>. (8) <i>Duryodhana</i> protected <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who was attacked by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with <i>Arjuna</i> at their head (VI, <b>69</b>). An awful carnage ensued. (9) <i>Duryodhana</i> and the <i>Kāliṅgas</i> placed <i>Bhīṣma</i> at their head and attacked the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, supporting <i>Bhīma</i>, attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i> (VI, <b>70</b>). <i>Arjuna (b</i>) attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i> with the <i>Gāṇḍīva (c</i>); the <i>Kurus</i> were afraid and seemed to melt away. (10) Then, with steeds of the <i>Kāmboja</i> breed, the <i>Kāliṅga</i> king, etc. (γ), surrounded <i>Śakuni. Bhīṣma</i>, etc., fought with <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (δ); <i>Drupada</i>, etc. (ε), fought with <i>Droṇa; Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman</i> attacked <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (VI, <b>71</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> encountered <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ζ). <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (η), attacked <i>Śālva</i> and the <i>Kaikeyas</i>. <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i> and <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> attacked the chariot-division of the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras. Bhīṣma</i> checked <i>Bhīmasena. Sātyaki</i> (<i>Yuyudhāna</i>) attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>, but had his charioteer slain. <i>Bhīṣma</i> slew the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> forces; but the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and the <i>Somakas</i> again attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>. (11) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc., attacked <i>Bhīṣma; Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, etc., attacked the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (VI, <b>72</b>). <C n='1'/><i>Virāṭa</i>. <C n='2'/><i>Aśvatthāman</i>. <C n='3'/><i>Duryodhana</i>. <C n='1'/><i>Bhīṣma</i>. <C n='2'/><i>Arjuna</i>. <C n='3'/><i>Bhīmasena</i>. <i>Abhimanyu</i> attacked <i>Citrasena</i>, etc. (θ). (12) <i>Duryodhana</i> attacked <i>Abhimanyu</i>, and so did <i>Lakṣmaṇa</i> (grandson of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>), who had his steeds and charioteer slain, and was carried away by <i>Kṛpa</i> on his chariot. The <i>Sṛñjayas</i> fought with the <i>Kurus</i> with their fists; <i>Bhīṣma</i> slew the troops of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with his celestial weapons (VI, <b>73</b>). (13) <i>Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna</i>) slew innumerable foes with his arrows; <i>Duryodhana</i> despatched 10,000 chariots against him, but he destroyed them all with his celestial weapons. <i>Sātyaki & Bhūriśravas (d); Sātyaki's</i> combatants fled and abandoned him; ten sons of <i>Yuyudhāna & Bhūriśravas</i> (son of <i>Bāhlīka's</i> son <i>Somadatta</i>) towards the afternoon; <i>Bhūriśravas</i> slew them; <i>Sātyaki & Bhūriśravas</i>, each of them slew the other's chariot-steeds; <i>Bhīmasena</i> took <i>Sātyaki</i> up on his own chariot, and <i>Duryodhana Bhūriśravas</i> on his. (14) The <i>Pāṇḍavas & Bhīṣma; Duryodhana</i> urged 25,000 to slay <i>Arjuna</i>, who, however, slew them all. The <i>Matsyas</i> and <i>Kekayas</i> surrounded <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Abhimanyu</i>. At sunset <i>Bhīṣma</i> caused the troops to be withdrawn, and so did the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Sṛñjayas</i> (VI, <b>74</b>).—§ 583: THE SIXTH DAY: After the night had passed away, the <i>Kurus</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> once more set out for battle. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> caused <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> to dispose the troops in the <i>Makara</i> array: <i>Drupada</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> = head; <i>Sahadeva</i> and <i>Nakula</i> = two eyes; <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena</i> = beak; <i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc. (α) = neck; <i>Virāṭa</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> = back; five <i>Kekaya</i> brothers = left wing; <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i> and <i>Cekitāna</i> = right wing; <i>Kuntibhoja</i> and <i>Śatānīka</i> = two feet; <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc. (β) = tail. <i>Bhīṣma</i> disposed his army in the form of a huge crane: <i>Droṇa</i> = beak; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> and <i>Kṛpa</i> = two eyes; <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, etc. (γ) = head; <i>Śūrasena</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> = neck; the <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> king, etc. (δ) = breast; the <i>Prasthala</i> king <i>Suśarman</i> = left wing; the <i>Tuṣāras</i>, etc. (ε) = right wing; <i>Śrutāyus</i>, etc. (ζ) = rear. The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army was protected by <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (η); the <i>Kaurava</i> army by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (θ). (1) <i>Bhīmasena & Droṇa</i>, who had his charioteer slain and then himself restrained his steeds. (2) Slaughtered by <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Bhīṣma</i>, the <i>Sṛñjayas</i> and <i>Kekayas</i> took to flight; and so did the <i>Kauravas</i>, mangled by <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> (VI, <b>75</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> recounted the excellency of the <i>Kaurava</i> army, protected by <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (ι). Neither men nor <i>Ṛṣis</i> of old ever beheld such an army. That it should yet be slaughtered, he thought was due only to fate (or to the Creator); <i>Vidura</i> had spoken well, but the wicked <i>Duryodhana</i> would not accept (VI, <b>76</b>). (3) <i>Bhīmasena</i> & the younger brothers of <i>Duryodhana: Duḥśāsana</i>, etc. (κ); <i>Bhīma</i> left his chariot and took up his mace. (4) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (forsaking <i>Droṇa</i>) proceeded towards <i>Śakuni</i>; seeing <i>Bhīma's</i> empty chariot, he became afflicted, but was comforted by the words of <i>Viśoka</i>; he took <i>Bhīma</i>, who was surrounded by foes on all sides, into his chariot. (5) The <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> (<i>Duryodhana</i>, etc.) & <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (who applied the weapon <i>Pramohana</i>). (6) <i>Droṇa & Drupada</i> (who left the battle); the <i>Somakas</i> were struck with fear. (7) <i>Droṇa</i>, with the weapon <i>Prajñā</i>, neutralized the <i>Pramohana</i> weapon in order to rescue <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra's</i> sons. (8) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sent the <i>Kaikeyas</i>, etc. (λ), headed by <i>Abhimanyu</i>, arrayed in a <i>Sūcīmukha</i>, to help <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> troops were quite helpless, like a lady in the streets. (9) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, causing <i>Bhīma</i> to be taken into the chariot of the <i>Kekaya</i> king, attacked <i>Droṇa</i>, who slew his charioteer and steeds; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> ascended the chariot of <i>Abhimanyu; Droṇa</i> broke the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army (VI, <b>77</b>). (10) <i>Duryodhana & Bhīma</i> (who ascended his own chariot); <i>Bhīma & Citrasena</i>, etc. (11) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sent 12 chariot-warriors (<i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc.) to follow <i>Bhīmasena</i> from behind; seeing them, the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> abandoned <i>Bhīma</i>. In the afternoon <i>Duryodhana</i> attacked <i>Abhimanyu</i> and <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena; Abhimanyu & Vikarṇa</i>, who had his steeds slain and mounted on the chariot of <i>Citrasena; Abhimanyu & Durjaya</i> and <i>Vikarṇa; Duḥśāsana</i> & the five <i>Kekaya</i> brothers; <i>Draupadeyāḥ</i> <i>& Duryodhana</i> (VI, <b>78</b>). <i>Duryodhana (b) & Bhīmasena</i> (who said that he, by slaying <i>D.</i>, would dispel the sorrows of <i>Kuntī</i>, etc.) (μ). (12) The <i>Sindhu</i> king came to the rescue of <i>Duryodhana; Kṛpa</i> caused <i>Duryodhana</i> to mount his own chariot; <i>Jayadratha & Bhīmasena</i>. (13) <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i>, etc. (ν), & the sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Abhimanyu & Vikarṇa</i> (who had his charioteer and steeds slain, and was himself pierced); <i>Durmukha & Śrutakarman</i> (who had his steeds slain); <i>Sutasoma</i> took <i>Śrutakarman</i> into his own chariot; <i>Śrutakīrti & Jayatseṅa</i> (Dhārtarāṣṭra); <i>Śatānīka & Jayatsena</i>; <i>Duṣkarṇa & Śatānīka</i>, who slew <i>Duṣkarṇa; Śatānīka</i> was surrounded by foes. (14) The five <i>Kekaya</i> brothers & the sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Durmukha</i>, etc. (ξ). About sunset <i>Bhīṣma</i> broke the ranks of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; and so did <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, having smelt the heads of <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and <i>Bhīmasena</i> (VI, <b>79</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> sought <i>Bhīṣma</i> in the night and gave expression to his grief at the success of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; <i>Bhīṣma</i> promised to do his best, at which <i>Duryodhana</i> was delighted (VI, <b>80</b>).—§ 584: THE SEVENTH DAY: <i>Bhīṣma</i> said to <i>Duryodhana</i> that he himself, etc. (α), were all prepared to battle for his sake; that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> could not be vanquished by the very gods including <i>Indra</i>, having <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> for their ally, etc.; but that he would either vanquish them or be vanquished by them. He gave <i>Duryodhana</i> a herb of great efficacy for healing his wounds. At dawn <i>Bhīṣma</i> disposed his troops in a <i>Maṇḍala</i> array (description), protected by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who was again protected by <i>Citrasena</i>, etc.; <i>Duryodhana</i> looked like <i>Śakra</i> himself. Then the <i>Dhārta-</i> <i>rāṣṭras</i> began to proceed, facing the west. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> disposed his troops in a <i>Vajra</i> array. (|) <i>Droṇa</i> & the <i>Matsya</i> king; <i>Aśvatthāman & Śikhaṇḍin; Duryodhana &</i> <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i> & the <i>Madra</i> king; <i>Vinda</i> and <i>Anuvinda & Irāvat</i>; many kings & <i>Arjuna</i>; <i>Bhīmasena & Kṛtavarman Hārdikya; Abhimanyu & Citrasena</i>, etc. (β) (sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>); <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> & the <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> king; <i>Alambuṣa & Sātyaki; Bhūriśravas & Dhṛṣṭaketu</i>; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> & king <i>Śrutāyus; Cekitāna & Kṛpa</i>. Others proceeded against <i>Bhīma</i>, and thousands against <i>Arjuna</i>, among others the <i>Trigarta</i> king with his brothers. D., D.-ṛ., G., and U. wondered, beholding the two <i>Kṛṣṇas</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna). <i>Arjuna</i> invoked the <i>Aindra</i> weapon; the foes fled, but were rescued by <i>Bhīṣma</i> (VI, <b>81</b>). (2) After <i>Suśarman</i> had ceased fighting, and the <i>Kuru</i> army had been routed by <i>Arjuna</i>, and <i>Bhīṣma</i> had proceeded against the chariot of <i>Arjuna, Duryodhana</i> exhorted the kings and <i>Suśarman</i> to protect <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who resembled the planet <i>Śukra</i> (Venus) and was surrounded by the <i>Trigartas. Droṇa</i> & the <i>Matsya</i> king (<i>Virāṭa</i>), who mounted the chariot of <i>Śaṅkha</i> (his son), who was slain by <i>Droṇa; Virāṭa</i> fled. <i>Śikhaṇḍin & Aśvatthāman; Śikhaṇḍin</i> descended, fought first with a sword, then mounted <i>Sālyaki's</i> chariot. <i>Sātyaki &</i> <i>Alambuṣa; Sātyaki</i> employed the <i>Aindra</i> weapon which he had obtained from <i>Arjuna</i>, and destroyed the creations of <i>Alambuṣa's</i> illusive power; <i>Alambuṣa</i> fled. <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna & Duryodhana</i>, who was forced to descend, mounted <i>Śakuni's</i> chariot. <i>Kṛtavarman & Bhīmasena; Kṛtavarman</i> went to the chariot of <i>Vṛṣaka</i> in the very sight of <i>Śalya</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i> (VI, <b>82</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> spoke to <i>Sañjaya</i> about the cheerfulness of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the cheerlessness of the <i>Kurus</i>, which he thought was destiny. (3) In the forenoon: The two <i>Avanti</i> princes & <i>Irāvat</i> (the daughter's son of the king of the <i>Nāgas</i>); <i>Anuvinda</i> mounted the chariot of <i>Vinda</i>; the horses ran away with the chariot. <i>Ghaṭotkava & Bhaga-</i> <i>datta</i>; D., G., and Ṛ. came there; except <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, the other <i>Pāṇḍava</i> warriors fled, but rallied. (4) The <i>Prāgjyotiṣa</i> king & <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i>, who fled. The ruler of the <i>Madras</i> (<i>Śalya</i>) & the twins; <i>Nakula</i> must mount the chariot of <i>Sahadeva; Śalya</i> was borne away by his charioteer (VI, <b>83</b>). When the sun reached the meridian: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> <i>& Śrutāyus</i>; D., G., and Rā. trembled; R. and D. prayed for the peace of the world; <i>Śrutāyus</i> fled, and the troops of <i>Duryodhana</i> turned away. <i>Cekitāna & Kṛpa; Cekitāna</i> was forced to descend and took up a mace, and then a sword; <i>Karakarṣa</i> took <i>Cekitāna</i> into his chariot, and <i>Śakuni</i> took <i>Kṛpa</i> into his. <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu & Bhūriśravas</i> (the son of <i>Somadatta</i>); <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i> mounted the chariot of <i>Śatānīka</i>. <i>Citrasena</i>, etc. (γ), & <i>Abhimanyu</i>, who did not slay them, remembering <i>Bhīma's</i> words. <i>Arjuna</i> caused <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to direct the chariot against <i>Bhīṣma; Arjuna & Suśarman</i> (VI, <b>84</b>); many were slain by <i>Arjuna</i>. (5) The <i>Trigarta</i> king and thirtytwo others attacked <i>Arjuna</i>, who slew sixty (so C.) chariotwarriors, and sped to kill <i>Bhīṣma</i>. (6) The <i>Trigarta</i> king attacked <i>Arjuna; Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc., came to his rescue; <i>Arjuna</i> shot at them with the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>. (7) <i>Duryodhana</i>, with <i>Jaya-</i> <i>dratha</i>, etc., came to protect <i>Bhīṣma</i> against <i>Arjuna</i>, who, avoiding them, attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>, as did also <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i>, etc. (δ), avoiding the <i>Madra</i> king. <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc. (ε), shot at the <i>Pāṇḍavas. Śikhaṇḍin</i> fled, but, rebuked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who reminded him of his oath, he again attacked <i>Bhīṣma</i>. <i>Śalya & Śikhaṇḍin</i>, who employed the <i>Vāruṇa</i> weapon. <i>Bhīmasena</i> (mace in hand) & <i>Jayadratha; Citrasena &</i> <i>Bhīmasena</i> (VI, <b>85</b>); <i>Citrasena</i> mounted on <i>Vikarṇa's</i> chariot. <i>Bhīṣma & Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (accompanied by the twins), who mounted <i>Nakula's</i> chariot. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> urged the kings to slay <i>Bhīṣma. Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma</i>, who disregarded him, remembering that he had formerly been a wife; the <i>Sṛñjayas</i> <i>& Bhīṣma</i>. (8) <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i> slaughter the <i>Kuru</i> army. (9) <i>Vinda</i> and <i>Anuvinda</i> attacked <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna</i>, who mounted <i>Sātyaki's</i> chariot. (10) <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> attacked <i>Vinda</i> and <i>Anuvinda</i>, protected by <i>Duryodhana</i>. (11) <i>Arjuna</i> fought against many foes. (12) <i>Droṇa</i> began to consume the <i>Pāñcālas</i> like fire a heap of cotton. (13) <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers surrounded <i>Bhīṣma</i> and fought against the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. At sunset Rā., Pś., etc., were seen all around. At sunset <i>Arjuna</i> (having vanquished <i>Suśarman</i>, etc.), <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with his brothers, <i>Bhīma-</i> <i>sena</i> (having vanquished <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc.), <i>Duryodhana</i> (protecting <i>Bhīṣma</i>), <i>Droṇa</i>, etc., proceeded to their tents (VI, <b>86</b>).—§ 585: THE EIGHTH DAY: Having passed the night, the <i>Kauravas</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> once more proceeded to battle. <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (α), formed the array, having <i>Bhīṣma</i> with the <i>Mālavas</i>, etc., in the van (β); next to him was <i>Droṇa</i> with the <i>Pulindas</i>, etc. (γ); next to <i>Droṇa</i> was <i>Bhagadatta</i> with the <i>Magadhas</i>, etc. (δ); behind him was the <i>Kośala</i> king <i>Bṛhadbala</i> with the <i>Melakas</i>, etc. (ε); next to him the <i>Prasthala</i> king <i>Traigarta</i>, etc. (ζ); next to the <i>Trigarta</i> king was <i>Aśvatthāman</i>; next to him <i>Duryodhana</i> with the whole army and his brothers; behind him <i>Kṛpa</i>. Urged by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> formed a <i>Śṛṅgāṭaka</i> array: <i>Bhīmasena</i> and <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. = the horns; next to them <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (η) = the centre; <i>Abhimanyu</i>, etc. (θ) = rear. Description of the battle. <i>Bhīṣma & Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (VI, <b>87</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira &</i> <i>Bhīṣma. Bhīmasena & Bhīṣma</i>, who was protected by <i>Duryodhana</i> and his brothers; the steeds ran away with <i>Bhīṣma; Bhīmasena</i> slew eight sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Sunābha</i>, etc. (ι). Then the other sons of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> all fled away. <i>Duryodhana</i> urged his brothers to kill <i>Bhīma</i>. They remembered the words of <i>Vidura. Duryodhana</i> blamed <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who reminded him of the words of <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (κ) (VI, <b>88</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> complained to <i>Sañjaya</i> that his sons, though assisted by <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (λ), were still slain; “What can be the reason save fate?” He regretted that the wicked <i>Duryodhana</i> had not obeyed <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (μ). <i>Sañjaya</i> said that <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> ought to have restrained his sons from gambling. At noon the whole <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army, at the command of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira—Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ν)— rushed against <i>Bhīṣma</i> alone. <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (ξ), rushed against all the kings under the command of <i>Duryodhana</i>.

Duryodhana</i> urged <i>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga's</i> son the Rā. (<i>c) [Alambuṣa]</i> (who hated <i>Bhīmasena</i> because he had killed <i>Baka</i>) to slay <i>Irāvat</i>; both of them had recourse to magic; <i>Nāgas</i> came to the rescue of <i>Irāvat</i>, but were consumed by a phantom in the form of <i>Garuḍa</i>: then <i>Irāvat</i> became confounded and was slain by <i>[Alambuṣa]</i>. <i>Arjuna</i>, etc. (τ), slew many.

Continuation: The extraordinary heroism of <i>Bhīṣma</i>: he (disregarding the <i>Pāñcāla</i> king and <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu</i>) & <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (χ); <i>Arjuna</i> (with <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i> ahead) & <i>Bhīṣma; Droṇa</i>, etc. (ψ) (employing celestial weapons), & <i>Arjuna; Sātyaki</i>, etc. (ω), & the <i>Kauravas</i>, in order to rescue <i>Arjuna; Arjuna</i> (with <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>) & <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who (remembering the boon granted by his father) now wished his death, which was approved of by Ṛ. and V. (heard only by <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Sañjaya</i>), etc.; <i>Bhīṣma</i> said to <i>Duḥśāsana</i> that <i>Arjuna</i> was invincible, and that he himself could not be vanquished by D., Dā., and Rā. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> urged his troops against <i>Bhīṣma</i>; <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> sons surrounded <i>Bhīṣma</i>, but fled for <i>Arjuna</i>; the <i>Sauvīras</i>, etc. (αα), abandoned <i>Bhīṣma</i>. A little before sunset <i>Bhīṣma</i> fell down from his chariot with his head to the east; there were heard celestial voices, etc.; as the sun was in the southern solstice, <i>Bhīṣma</i> postponed his death; <i>Gaṅgā</i> sent to him the great Ṛ. in form of swans inhabiting the <i>Mānasa</i> lake. The <i>Kurus</i>, headed by <i>Kṛpa</i> and <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i>, sighed and wept; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Sṛñjayas</i>, etc. (ββ), uttered loud shouts. Ṛ. and P. applauded <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who had recourse to that <i>Yoga</i> which is taught in the great <i>Upaniṣads</i> (VI, <b>119</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, mentioning <i>Bhīṣma's brahmacarya</i> for the sake of his father, and that he had not been slain by <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>, grieved that he had been slain by <i>Śikhaṇḍin. Sañjaya</i> related that <i>Bhīṣma</i> lay on his bed of arrows, without, however, touching the earth. Both the <i>Kurus</i> (<i>Karṇa, Duryodhana</i>, etc.) and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were despondent; the welkin was enveloped with a gloom, etc.; Ṛ., Si., and Cā. mentioned his <i>brahmacarya</i> for his father's sake. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> blew their conches, and <i>Bhīmasena</i> sported in great glee. <i>Duḥśāsana</i> informed <i>Droṇa</i>, who fell down from his chariot, and then ordered the <i>Kurus</i> to desist from battle; and so did the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. Then the kings of both armies all repaired to <i>Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma's</i> head hanging down, he asked a pillow; he refused the soft pillows offered him, and asked <i>Arjuna</i> to give him a suitable pillow; <i>Arjuna</i> supported his head with three arrows shot from the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> and inspired with <i>mantras; Bhīṣma</i> was highly gratified. He caused <i>Duryodhana</i> to dismiss the physicians; he asked that a ditch should be dug around him, until the sun should proceed towards the direction occupied by <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> (i.e. the north), and told them to cease fighting. Stationing guards all around for his protection, the heroes repaired for rest in the evening. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> congratulated <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, “that canst slay with thy eyes alone”; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> ascribed the victory to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (VI, <b>120</b>).—§ 588: THE ELEVENTH DAY: After the night had passed away, maidens came to <i>Bhīṣma</i> and showered flowers upon him. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Kauravas</i> assembled together like brothers around his body. <i>Bhīṣma</i> asked for water; he refused the excellent viands and water offered him, and asked <i>Arjuna</i> to give him water; <i>Arjuna</i> mounted his chariot, and from the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> shot an arrow inspired with <i>mantras</i> and identified with the <i>Pārjanya</i> weapon, piercing therewith the earth, and there arose a jet of pure and cold water; <i>Bhīṣma</i> praised <i>Arjuna</i>: “even <i>Nārada</i> spoke of thee as an ancient Ṛṣi”; he mentioned his alliance with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and regretted that <i>Duryodhana</i> had not listened to the words of <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (α). He said to <i>Duryodhana</i> that the weapons appertaining to <i>Agni</i>, etc. (β), were known only to <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and told him to make peace, as long as <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (γ), did not consume his troops; “let <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> go to <i>Indraprastha.”</i> But <i>Duryodhana</i> would not accept his counsels (VI, <b>121</b>). All the kings retired. <i>Karṇa</i> visited <i>Bhīṣma</i> in private. <i>Bhīṣma</i> told <i>Karṇa</i> that he was not the son of <i>Rādhā</i>, but of <i>Kuntī</i>; that he knew from <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Vyāsa</i>; “sinfully didst thou come into the world; therefore it is that thy heart has been such, and also because thou didst associate with the low”; he mentioned that, proceeding to the city of <i>Kāśi, Karṇa</i> alone, with his bow, had crushed the kings in battle in order to procure a bride for the <i>Kuru</i> king; <i>Jarāsandha</i> could not become a match to <i>Karṇa</i> in fight. He adjured <i>Karṇa</i> to unite with his uterine brothers. <i>Karṇa</i> mentioned that <i>Kuntī</i> had abandoned him, and his obligations to <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (δ); he would fight <i>Arjuna</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> though they were protected by <i>Kṛṣṇa. Bhīṣma</i> gave permission to <i>Karṇa</i> to fight, making heaven his goal, and then dismissed him (VI, <b>122</b>)."
