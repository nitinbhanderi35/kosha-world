It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as extending up to the four oceans (<i>caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-</i> <i>śasaḥ</i>). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts, Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’ while the reverse has <i>‘Parākramaḥ’</i> as his title. The name ‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.<sup>61</sup> Mookerji<sup>62</sup> holds that Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudragupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.<sup>63</sup> Vāmana in his Kāvyalaṃkāra<sup>64</sup> refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of Samudragupta.<sup>65</sup> But it seems to be the name of a local king of Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta dynasty.<sup>66</sup> Another probable and most suitable explanation of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’, Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.<sup>67</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of these are also supported by numismatic evidence.<sup>68</sup>"
