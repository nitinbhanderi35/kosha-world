Viśvāmitra obtained Brāhmaṇatva (Brahminhood) by doing penance in this place. Towards the end of his life Ruṣaṅgu and his sons came to Pṛthūdakatīrtha and sang laudatory songs about Pṛthūdakatīrtha. Ruṣaṅgu said that those who did penance and died in this holy bath would not have to undergo miseries after death. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 39, Stanza 24)."
