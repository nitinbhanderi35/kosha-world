Caitrarathap.). <i>Arjuna</i> asked: “Why did <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i> command his queen to go to <i>Vasiṣṭha?</i> And was this an act of sin on the part of <i>Vasiṣṭha?</i>” The <i>Gandharva</i> said: Under the influence of the curse, <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i>, in anger, went out of his capital, accompanied by his wife. In a solitary part of the woods he saw a <i>brahman</i> and his wife (<i>Āṅgirasī</i>, v. 6908) embracing each other. The couple ran away, but <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i> forcibly seized the <i>brahman</i>. The <i>brāhmaṇī</i> asked him to liberate her husband, but he cruelly devoured him. The tears that the woman shed blazed up like fire and consumed everything in that place. The <i>brāhmaṇī</i> cursed the <i>rājarṣi</i>, saying that he should meet with instant death when cohabiting with his wife, and that his wife should have a son from <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, whose children he had devoured, and that child should be the propagator of his race. Then she entered the fire. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, by his ascetic power, immediately knew all about it. And long after this, when the <i>rājarṣi</i> became freed from his curse, he approached his wife <i>Madayantī</i>, not remembering the curse of the <i>brāhmaṇī</i>. Hearing, however, the words of his wife, he recollected the curse, and, therefore, he appointed <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> to beget a son on his queen (I, <b>182</b>)."
