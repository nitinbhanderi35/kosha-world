Pārvatīyas were also present for the Rājasūya of Dharmaputra. When the Pāṇḍavas had to fight against Jayadratha during their exile in the forests these pārvatīyas fought on the side of Jayadratha. Arjuna killed them all. In the Kurukṣetra battle the Pārvatīyas fought on the side of the Kauravas. Pārvatīya was a very important country of ancient Bhārata. Once the Pārvatīyas fought against Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa conquered them. In the great battle the pārvatīyas fought against the Pāṇḍavas under the banners of Śakuni and Ulūka. The Pāṇḍavas destroyed them all.
