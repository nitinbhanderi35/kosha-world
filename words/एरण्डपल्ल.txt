            "content": "<i>Eraṇḍapalla</i>¦ (No. I, L. 19): It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet identifies Eraṇḍapalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh district of the Bombay Presidency.<sup>450</sup> K.N. Dikshit and Y.R. Gupte agreed with this view.<sup>451</sup> But according to Dubreuil and K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.<sup>452</sup> G. Ramdas opposes Fleet's identification on the ground that Eraṇḍapallī mentioned immediately after the kingdom of Svāmidatta cannot be so far away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity of Kaliṅga and Piṣṭapura kingdom.<sup>453</sup> Eraṇḍapallī is mentioned in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kaliṅga.<sup>454</sup> Banerjee counts Damana of Eraṇḍapalla among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their country.<sup>455</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>G. Ramdas<sup>456</sup> regards Dubreuil's identification also to be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kaliṅga which was clearly the country ruled by Svāmidatta. Eraṇḍapallī will have, therefore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village Eṇḍapalli in Elore Tāluka.<sup>457</sup> But if we suppose that Svāmidatta was the king of Koṭṭūra alone and not of the whole of Kaliṅga, Eraṇḍapallī may well be identified with Chicacole.<sup>458</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Palla is the corrupt form of Pallī which means an inhabitation and Eraṇḍa is the castor-oil-plant<sup>459</sup> It seems that the region abounded in eraṇḍa plants. <dvsn n='P'/><i>Place-names ending in Gohālī</i>"
