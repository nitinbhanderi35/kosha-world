In Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 32, Verse 5 we see that Nakula had won a victory over Marudhanva during his triumphal march over the western country. Kāmyakavana in which is included Tṛṇabindu sarovara, is in Marudhanva. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 258, Verse 13). Marudhanva was also known as “Mārvāṭa”. The sage Uttaṅka lived in Mārvāṭa. In Mahābhārata, Aśvamedha Parva, Chapters 53, 54 and 55 it is stated that once Śrī Kṛṣṇa showed his Viśvarūpa to this sage at Mārvāṭa."
