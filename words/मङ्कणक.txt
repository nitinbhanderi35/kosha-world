Tīrthayātrāp.): At the tīrtha <i>Saptasārasvata</i> the great <i>ṛṣi M</i>. became perfect (<i>siddhaḥ</i>), so that when he had cut his hand with the pointed blade of a <i>kuśa</i> grass, there flew from his wound vegetable juice, at which he began to dance, and the animate and inanimate creation also began to dance together with him. Then the gods, headed by Brahman and the ṛṣis, asked <i>Mahādeva</i> (i.e. Śiva) to prevent him from dancing. The god then in the presence of <i>M</i>. pressed his thumb with the tip of his own finger, and from the wound there came ashes, white as snow. Then <i>M</i>. became ashamed and adored <i>Rudra</i>, saying that he was the refuge of the world, including the gods and the Asuras, that he had created the three worlds, and swallows everything at the end of the <i>yuga</i>, that he cannot be fathomed by the gods themselves, that all the gods headed by <i>Brahmán</i> are to be seen in him, etc. At his request <i>Śiva</i> said to the <i>Brahmarṣi</i> that his asceticism (<i>tapas</i>) should through the grace of <i>Śiva</i> increase a thousandfold, that he would dwell with him in the āśrama, and that those who bathe in <i>Sapta-</i> <i>sārasvata</i> and worship <i>Śiva</i> should be able to obtain everything here and hereafter, and go to the <i>Sārasvata loka</i>; then <i>Mahādeva</i> disappeared: III, <b>83</b>, 6086.—§ 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, <b>37</b>, 2185 (<i>siddhaḥ…mahāmuniḥ</i>, had performed austerities at Saptasārasvata); <b>38</b>, 2186.— § 615<i>j</i> (do.): <i>M</i>. had from his youth led the life of a <i>brahma-</i> <i>cārin</i>. Once, when performing his ablutions in the river <i>Sarasvatī</i>, he beheld a woman bathing in the river; at this sight his seed dropped and fell into the <i>Sarasvatī</i>; he took it up and placed it in his earthen pot; then it became divided into seven parts, whence were born seven <i>ṛṣis: Vāyuvega</i>, etc. (β), who were the progenitors of the <i>Maruts</i>. (Then the same story as in § 365 is related.) <i>M</i>. was the son of <i>Mātariśvan</i> and <i>Sukanyā</i>: IX, <b>38</b>, 2217, 2224, 2244.— § 615 (do.): IX, <b>39</b>, 2246. Cf. Brahmarṣi."
