None save <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (who were always acceptable to him) could address <i>Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, addressing him, told (VII, <b>72</b>) him the particulars of <i>Abhimanyu's</i> heroism and fall. <i>Arjuna</i> vowed to slay <i>Jayadratha</i> before the setting of the morrow's sun (his oath); even as to <i>As., D.</i>, men, birds, snakes, <i>P.</i>, wanderers of the night, <i>B.-ṛ., D.-ṛ.</i>, etc., he said that they would not succeed in protecting him, even if he entered <i>Rasātala</i>, or ascended the firmament, or repaired to the city of the gods (<i>Devapuraṃ</i>) or the city of <i>Diti (Diteḥ puraṃ</i>); if the sun set before he had slain him, he would himself ascend the pyre. <i>Arjuna</i> bent the <i>Gāṇḍīva, Kṛṣṇa</i> blew the <i>Pāñcajanya</i>, <i>Arjuna</i> the <i>Devadatta</i> (VII, <b>73</b>). Having been informed by spies, <i>Jayadratha</i> was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear, thinking that not even <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. (α), not even <i>D., G., As.</i>, <i>U., Rā.</i>, can protect him against <i>Arjuna</i>; he wished to return home. <i>Duryodhana</i> comforted him, saying that he, <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (β), would protect him. <i>Jayadratha</i>, accompanied by <i>Duryodhana</i>, repaired that very night to <i>Droṇa</i> and questioned him about the difference between himself and <i>Arjuna. Droṇa</i> said they had got the same instruction, but <i>Arjuna</i> was superior to <i>Jayadratha</i> in consequence of <i>yoga</i> and the hard life led by <i>Arjuna; Droṇa</i> would, however, protect him, forming an impenetrable array; and, moreover, death ought not to be an object of terror to him (VII, <b>74</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> remonstrated with <i>Arjuna</i> for his rash vow; the <i>Kurus</i> had expected an attack by <i>Arjuna</i>; now they will protect <i>Jayadratha</i> (who had mentioned <i>Arjuna's</i> encounter with <i>Śiva, Hiraṇyapura</i>, etc.); <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (γ) would be in <i>Jayadratha's</i> van; <i>Droṇa's</i> army would be half a <i>śakaṭa</i> and half a lotus with a needle-mouthed array in the middle (VII, <b>75</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> assured <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> of his competence to accomplish his vow, notwithstanding <i>Droṇa, Sā., R., V., A.</i>, <i>M.</i>, with <i>Indra, V.-D., D., P., G., Garuḍa</i>, etc., by the means of <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> and the weapons he had obtained from <i>Yama</i>, etc. (δ), and the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon (VII, <b>76</b>). The gods with <i>Indra</i> became very anxious. Sinister omens appeared in nature. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> went to <i>Arjuna's</i> abode and comforted <i>Subhadrā</i> (with the <i>kṣatriya</i> duties, etc., and revenge) (VII, <b>77</b>). <i>Subhadrā</i> lamented over <i>Abhimanyu</i>, and said “fie on <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc.” (ε), because they had not protected him. <i>Draupadī</i> and <i>Uttarā</i> came to her, lamenting <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that <i>Abhimanyu</i> had obtained the most laudable and enviable goal. Then he returned to <i>Arjuna</i> (VII, <b>78</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> performed his usual nightly sacrifice to <i>Śiva. Kṛṣṇa</i> with <i>Dāruka</i> repaired to his own tent. None in the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> camp slept that night, thinking of <i>Arjuna</i>. In the middle of the night <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said to <i>Dāruka</i> that he had resolved to fight to-morrow [if necessary]; he should equip his chariot, placing on it <i>Kaumodakī</i>, etc., making room for <i>Garuḍa</i>, and yoking thereto <i>Balāhaka</i>, etc. (ζ); when hearing <i>Pañcajanya</i> emitting the shrill <i>Ṛṣabha</i> note, he should come to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (VII, <b>79</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> in a dream saw <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who told him not to grieve, and mentioned the <i>Pāśupata</i> weapon (with which <i>Śiva</i> slew all the <i>Daityas</i> in battle); if he remembered it now, he would be able to slay <i>Jayadratha</i> to-morrow; otherwise he should pray to <i>Śiva</i>. At the <i>Brāhma</i> hour, <i>Arjuna</i> saw himself sojourning through the sky (<i>Himavat</i>); <i>Maṇimat</i>, frequented by <i>Si</i>. and <i>Cā.</i>, etc. (η) with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, to where <i>Śiva</i> was seated with <i>Pārvatī</i> (description) (δ); <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> hymned <i>Mahādeva</i> (VII, <b>80</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> saw that the offerings he had made every night to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had come to <i>Śiva</i>, and he mentally worshipped both <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Śiva. Śiva</i> then told <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> where to fetch his bow and arrow from a lake of <i>amṛta</i>. In the lake they saw two terrible snakes; when they had uttered the <i>Brahma Śatarudriya</i>, the snakes assumed the forms of a bow and arrow. From <i>Śiva's</i> body there came out a <i>brahmacārin</i> of blue throat and red locks, and having showed <i>Arjuna</i> the use of the bow and arrow, and the <i>mantras</i>, he sped these weapons to that same lake. Having thus once more obtained the <i>Pāśupata</i> weapon, <i>Arjuna</i> with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came back to their own camp (VII, <b>81</b>).—§ 597: THE FOURTEENTH DAY. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> underwent his morning rites (very copious description); <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> visited <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (VII, <b>82</b>). Then also <i>Virāṭa</i>, etc., came (α). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to rescue the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, quoting <i>Nārada. Kṛṣṇa</i> assured <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> of <i>Arjuna's</i> success (VII, <b>83</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> came and acquainted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> of his dream. Then he and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Yuyudhāna</i> (these two in one chariot) set out to <i>Arjuna's</i> pavilion. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> equipped <i>Arjuna's</i> chariot (which had previously been sanctified by <i>manīras</i>), which <i>Arjuna</i> circumambulated, bow and arrows in hand. <i>Arjuna, Yuyu-</i> <i>dhāna</i>, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> mounted the chariot. Many auspicious omens appeared. <i>Arjuna</i> charged <i>Yuyudhāna</i> to protect <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in his absence (only he or <i>Pradyumna</i> is able to do it). <i>Yuyudhāna</i> proceeded to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (VII, <b>84</b>)."
