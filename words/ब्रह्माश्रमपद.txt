Ed. 13. 10. 14: <i>pravrāja-</i> <i>yitum vidhivat svocitaṃ karma tyājayitum</i>); the head of the <i>āśrama</i> told him that it was not possible for him to be an ascetic (<i>pra-</i> <i>vrājaka</i>) and live in the <i>āśrama (na śakyam</i> <i>iha śūdreṇa liṅgam āśritya vartitum)</i> 13. 10. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 16: <i>liṅgaṃ</i> <i>saṃnyāsacihnam</i>); so the Śūdra went some distance from the <i>āśramapada</i> and constructed a cottage for himself; he put up an altar, levelled the ground, and raised abodes for gods (<i>gatvāśramapadād dūram uṭajaṃ</i> <i>kṛtavāṃs tu saḥ / tatra vediṃ ca bhūmiṃ</i> <i>ca devatāyatanāni ca / niveśya /</i>) 13. 10. 17 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 20: <i>vedīṃ pūjārthaṃ, bhūmiṃ śayanādyartham</i>); a certain ascetic (<i>muni, ṛṣi, tāpasa</i>) who acted as a priest for the rites of manes (<i>pitṛkārya</i>) of this Śūdra became in his next birth the Purohita of the king (viz. the Śūdra who was born as a king); when the Purohita was told by the king about his past life he went to the same Brahmāśrama to practise austerities; he obtained great perfection (<i>siddhiṃ parāṃ prāptaḥ</i>) and was respected by the residents of the <i>āśrama</i> 13. 10. 10-59."
