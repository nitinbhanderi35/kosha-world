He was the son of Vasudeva by Devakī, but was transferred from the latter to the womb of Rohiṇī, the other wife of Vasudeva, and hence his name, सङ्कर्षणः. Other names for him are — (Fond of wine) प्रियमधुः <i>m.</i> — (Killer of the boxer Muṣṭika) मुष्टिकान्तकः. — (Secret in motion) गुप्तचरः. — (Strong and good) बलभद्रः."
