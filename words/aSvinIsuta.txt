Once when the wife of Sutapas was on a pilgrimage Sūrya happened to see her. The beautiful and venerable lady refused to accede to the desire of Sūrya and so the latter used force and took her. They had a son who was named Aśvinīsuta. On her return after the pilgrimage with her son she explained all that happened and the sage sent both of them out. Sūrya taught his son Aśvinīsuta astrology and made him a master in that science. Knowing that, Sutapas cursed him and said he would turn to be one very diseased. Later the sage amended his curse and added that he would be free from disease if he worshipped the sun."
