The genealogy of the Kuru Kings is as follows: Sudhanus-Cyavana-KṛtiUparicaravasu-Bṛhadratha-Kuśāgraja-ṚṣabhaPuṣpavān-Juhu. <dvsn n='NI'/>Jarāsandha was another son of Bṛhadratha. Jarāsandha had four sons called Soma, Sahadeva, Turya and Śrutaśru. From Jahnu, the following sons were born:—Suratha-Viḍūratha-Sārvabhauma-Jayatsena,-Ravīya-Bhāvuka-Cakroddhata-DevātithiṚkṣa-Bhīma and Pratīca. Pratīca had three sons called Devāpi, Śantanu and Bālhīka. Śantanu is known as Mahābhiṣak also. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu were the successors of Śantanu, and they came to be known as Kauravas also as they belonged to the dynasty of Kuru. But, since the sons of Pāṇḍu were born of Devas they may not be called Kauravas. 2) <i>Other Information.</i> (1) Kurukṣetra became holy and sanctified on account of Kuru's tapas.
