He therefore asked the Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to realize that it was futile to run after various longings because the door to heaven was closed for such men (<i>kāmān icched kathaṃ</i> <i>naraḥ / svargadvāraṃ hi saṃruddhaṃ mānu-</i> <i>ṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ //</i> 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear, arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder men from going to heaven (<i>tato 'paśyat sa</i> <i>kāmaṃ ca krodhaṃ lobhaṃ bhayaṃ madam /</i> <i>nidrāṃ tandrīṃ tathālasyam āvṛtya puruṣān</i> <i>sthitān // </i> 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned before, stopped men from going to heaven; gods were afraid of such men; (these vices), as ordained by the gods, create obstacles all around (<i>tathaiva devavacanād vighnaṃ</i> <i>kurvanti sarvaśaḥ //</i> 12. 263. 47); no one who was not permitted by gods could be virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his austerities, could confer kingdoms and wealth on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet of the cloud (<i>toyadhāriṇe</i> i. e. Kuṇḍadhāra) and told him that he had done a great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍadhāra to forgive him for having formerly envied him (<i>purā te yad asūyitam</i>) due to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that he had forgiven him and then disappeared; the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the skies due to his austerities to which he was led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness he also gained what he wanted and the highest bliss (<i>vihāyasā ca gamanaṃ tathā</i> <i>saṃkalpitārthatā / dharmāc chaktyā tathā</i> <i>yogād yā caiva paramā gatiḥ //</i>) 12. 263. 53."
