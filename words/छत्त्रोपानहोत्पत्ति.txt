One day, at noontide, when the Sun was in <i>Jyeṣṭhāmūla, Reṇukā</i>, her head and feet being scorched by the heat of the Sun, rested for a moment under a tree, whereafter <i>Jamadagni</i> threatened to shoot the Sun. The Sun, in the guise of a brahman, approached him and reminded him that the Sun produces food, etc. (XIII, <b>95</b>). [Further] questioned by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> said: As <i>Jamadagni</i> did not desist from his anger, the brahman reminded him that the Sun is always in motion and cannot therefore be pierced; <i>Jamadagni</i>, knowing <i>Sūrya</i>, said that the Sun stays at midday for a moment. Then <i>Sūrya</i> sought his protection, and <i>Jamadagni</i> comforted him, saying “he who would slay one who asks for protection would transcend the simplicity that exists in brahmans, etc. (α).” <i>Sūrya</i> presented him with an umbrella and a pair of sandals, saying, “from this day the gift of these articles in all religious rites shall be established as an indispensable usage.” (XIII, <b>96</b>)."
