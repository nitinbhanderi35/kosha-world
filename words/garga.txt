The child from the mother's womb said ‘no’ to the move. But, Bṛhaspati cursed the child and had his own way with Mamatā. Thus two children developed in her womb. Just after delivering the children the mother went away leaving the child by Bṛhaspati behind. The Devas took charge of the forsaken child and named him Bharadvāja. Ultimately they handed over the child (Bharadvāja) to king Bharata, the famous son of Duṣyanta. Children had already been born to Bharata by his three wives, but as all of them were found to be immoral the mothers themselves killed them. It was at such a juncture that Bharata got Bharadvāja as adopted son. (Bharadvāja is known by another name also, Vitatha). From Vitatha was born Manyu, from Manyu Bṛhatkṣetra from Bṛhatkṣetra Jaya and from Jaya Garga. The famous Rantideva was the grandson of Nara. (the brother of Garga) and son of Saṃkṛti.
