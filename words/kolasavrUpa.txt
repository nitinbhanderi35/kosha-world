After the decline of the second Cera empire in Kerala, several royal families such as Perumpaṭappu, Neḍuvirippu, Kolasvarūpa, Veṇāṭu etc. came into power. Some details regarding the family of Kolasvarūpa are given below. <dvsn n='NI'/>In ‘Kerala Māhātmya’, it is given that Paraśurāma had made a Soma-Kṣatriya, as King of Cirakkal or Kolattunāḍu. According to ‘Keralotpatti’ it was Ceramān Perumāl who did this. Logan says that Kolasvarūpa came into being from the children born to the last Perumāl of the Veṇāṭu family. In the edicts Vīrarāghavapaṭṭaya or Jūtaśāsana no mention is made about Kolattunāḍu. Both the families of Veṇāṭu and Kolattunāḍu, from very early times had observed the customary rites of taint, pollution, defilement etc. It is said in ‘Keralamāhātmya’ that Paraśurāma had enthroned the sons of two sisters in both the kingdoms. But no documents are available to prove that there was any connection between the two families till the 5th century M.E. (Malayālam Era). i.e. 14th century A.D. See under Kollavarṣa."
