The <ab>mg.</ab> is regular for <lang>Skt.</lang> deśayati and for upadiśati, pradiśati, but not recorded for the causatives of the two latter. Nevertheless it seems necessary to keep the <ab>mss.</ab> readings, rather than read (upa-, pra-)darśenti, as <ls>Senart</ls> in his note was tempted to do (and that <ab>altho</ab> forms of darśayati are similarly used in the context, <ab>e.g.</ab> 〔170.4, 6〕)."
