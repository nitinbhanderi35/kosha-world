This Usik was the maid of the queen of the old King of Kaliṅga. The king requested Dīrghatamas to beget children by his queen. The queen did not like this. She sent her maid Usik to Dīrghatamas. The hermit Kakṣīvān was the son born to Dīrghatamas by Uśik. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 18, Sūkta 125)."
