Retaining only the control of its internal administration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudragupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify his imperious commands.<sup>647</sup> Samataṭa is the only territory in Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.<sup>648</sup> The first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this inscription.<sup>649</sup> Literally the name means ‘the shore country’ or ‘Level country’.<sup>650</sup> ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.<sup>651</sup> The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him, this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and was more than 3,000 li in circuit.<sup>652</sup> From Samataṭa, the pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and reached Tanmolihti,<sup>653</sup> or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in the Midnāpur district.<sup>654</sup> Samataṭa, therefore, must have been the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna districts.<sup>655</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>It is known from the Baghaura Inscription<sup>656</sup> that the Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūlakalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the Lohitya.<sup>657</sup> The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with Samataṭa.<sup>658</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa comprised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.<sup>659</sup> Its capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12 miles west of Comilla district.<sup>660</sup> After the rule of the Guptas, Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman and Sena dynasties.<sup>661</sup>"
