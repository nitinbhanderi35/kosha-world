One hundred preceptors always used to live in his palace. Given to the study of the <i>Vedas</i>, he was not very well satisfied with the speculations of his instructors on the character of the soul and their doctrines of extinction upon the dissolution of the body or of rebirth after death. Once the great ascetic <i>Pañcaśikha Kāpileya</i> came to <i>Mithilā</i>, having roamed over the earth. He seemed to have assumed the form of that great <i>Ṛ</i>. [and] <i>Prajāpati</i>, whom the <i>Sāṅkhyas</i> call <i>Kapila</i>; they say he was the first disciple of <i>Āsuri</i> [and] long-living. He was performing a mental sacrifice for 1,000 years (cf. Pañcasrotas). He was fully conversant with the <i>Pañcarātra</i> (i.e. “the sacrifice that leads to the state of <i>Viṣṇu”</i>, Nīl.) and the five sheaths that cover the soul, etc. He had approached one day a large concourse [of <i>Ṛ</i>.] following the <i>Sāṅkhya</i> doctrine (<i>Kāpilaṃ</i>), and instructed them about the Unmanifest; <i>Āsuri</i> had inquired of his preceptor (? so Nīl. and PCR.) and understood the distinction between the body and the soul, and had acquired celestial vision. For that assembly of <i>Ṛ., Āsuri</i> made his exposition of <i>Bráhman</i>. <i>Pañcaśikha</i> became a disciple of <i>Āsuri</i>; he lived on human milk; he was accepted as a son by the <i>brāhmaṇī Kapilā</i>, the wife of <i>Āsuri</i>, and used to suck her breasts. This was said to me by the holy one [i.e. Mārkaṇḍeya or Sanatkumāra, Nīl.]. <i>Janaka</i>, abandoning his 100 preceptors, began to follow <i>Kāpileya</i> (i.e. <i>Pañcaśikha</i>) upon the religion of emancipation which is explained in <i>Sāṅkhya</i> treatises. “Some say that, when ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, the destruction of existence itself follows [this opinion also is erroneous].” The king became filled with wonder (XII, <b>218</b>). Continuation of the discourse between <i>Pañcaśikha</i> and the king on the topic of existence and non-existence after death. The <i>Mithilā</i> king (<i>Maithilena</i>), beholding his city burning in a conflagration, himself proclaimed (<i>gītaṃ</i>), “in this conflagration nothing of mine is burning.” The king gave up his sorrows, etc. He who reads this discourse attains to emancipation (XII, <b>219</b>)."
