Ashamed of these sinful creations, Brahmā created seers like Sanaka, Sananda, etc. They also did not proceed with the work of creation as was desired. So Brahmā grew angry and down came Rudra from the midst of his eye-brows. He was assigned places and women. Finding his creation intolerable, Brahmā sent him away for penance, and produced ten mind-born sons, Maricī, Atri and others, and a daughter Sarasvatī. Then came the Vedas and other literature. Further the Creator's body got into two halves — one Svāyambhuva and the other Śatarūpa. These were parents of two sons and three daughters. Their descendants filled up the whole of the earth. Another account of creation. <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. III. 5. 27-36; 6. (whole); 12. (whole); 20. 12 ff."
