But there is no ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pañcāla king; he seems rather to have lived at some distance from the KuruPañcālas. There is no good reason to deny his identity<sup>2</sup> with the Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> king of <b>Kāśi,</b> who was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by <b>Sātrājita Śatānīka.</b> The fact that the latter was a <b>Bharata</b> also points to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's not having been a Kuru-Pañcāla at all. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā he appears as having a dispute with <b>Vaka Dālbhi;</b> but even assuming that the latter was a Pañcāla, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and Pañcāla.<sup>4</sup> It is true that in the Epic <b>Śantanu</b> and Vicitravīrya and Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself are all connected, but this connexion seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derangement of great figures of the past. <F>1) x. 6. <i>Cf.</i> Weber, <i>Indische Studien,</i> 3, 469 <i>et seq.</i></F> <F>2) As does Weber, <i>Indian Literature,</i> 90, 114, 125; <i>Episches im vedischen Ritual,</i> 7, 8.
