Once when Dhanaśarmā went to the forest to get darbha he confronted three fierce evil spirits and getting frightened ran away from them. But the spirits followed him and the Brahmin then cried and said “Oh, please do not harm me. Mahāviṣṇu will bless you.” <dvsn n='NI'/>The moment they heard the name of Viṣṇu there came a change in them. They reiterated their story to Dhanaśarmā. Their names were Vaiśākha, Sudāsa and Advaita. Because of the ingratitude of Vaiśākha he got a nick-name ‘Kṛtaghna’ (ungrateful man) also. All the three were human beings in their previous birth. Not only that, Advaita was a king called Harivīra. All the three became evil spirits because of their sins. <dvsn n='NI'/>From the conversation Dhanaśarmā understood that Vaiśākha was his father and they then knew each other. The son then anxiously enquired what he should do to absolve his father of his sins and save him from hell. Vaiśākha then told him observe the vrata, Vaiśākhapūrṇimā. He did that and all the spirits went to heaven. (Chapter 94, Padma Purāṇa)."
