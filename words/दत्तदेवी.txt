Literally <i>‘Dhruva’</i> means unchangeable or constant. It is also the name of the polar star (personified as son of Uttāna-pāda and grandson of Manu).<sup>120</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>3 (b). <i>Dhruvasvāminī</i> (No. 42, LL. 3-4): We come to know of Dhruvasvāminī only in No. 42. Lines 1-3 mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevī elsewhere appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāragupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāragupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers."
