The holy <i>Ṛṣi (bhagavān ṛṣiḥ) Kaṇva</i> said to <i>Duryodhana</i> in the assembly of the <i>Kurus: Brahmán</i>, the grandsire of the universe (<i>Lokapitāmahaḥ</i>), is indestructible and eternal. The holy <i>Ṛṣis (bhagavantāv ṛṣī) Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> are of the same character. Of all the sons of <i>Aditi, Viṣṇu</i> alone is eternal…In this connection is cited an old story: <i>Mātali</i>, the charioteer of <i>Indra</i>, had, by his wife <i>Sudharmā</i>, one beautiful daughter, <i>Guṇakeśī</i>. As he found no suitable husband for her amongst D., Dai., G., or men and Ṛ., <i>Mātali</i> set out for the <i>Nāgaloka</i> (V, <b>97</b>). On the way <i>Nārada</i>, proceeding to visit <i>Varuṇa</i>, followed <i>Mātali</i>, and first showed him the abode of <i>Varuṇa</i>, surrounded by his sons and grandsons. <i>Varuṇa's</i> son <i>Puṣkara</i> had been chosen as husband by <i>Soma's</i> daughter <i>Jyotsnākālī</i> (who had [before] chosen (so PCR.) the eldest and foremost of <i>Aditi's</i> sons (i.e. Sūrya, Nīl.)). He then showed him the abode, entirely made of gold, of the liquor (<i>Vāruṇyaṃ</i>): to the possession of that liquor (<i>surā</i>) the gods owe their being <i>Surāḥ</i>. He showed him also the weapons that had belonged to the <i>Daityas</i> and had been obtained by the gods as a booty of war; when hurled at the foe they always return into the hand that hurls them. Here dwelt in days of yore many tribes of Rā. and Dai. Here is that fire of blazing flames and the discus of <i>Viṣṇu</i>; and that knotty bow that was created for the destruction of the world; it is always protected with great vigilance by the gods, and it is from this bow that the one wielded by <i>Arjuna</i> has taken its name; it is endued with the strength of 100,000 bows; it punishes all wicked (<i>rakṣo-</i> <i>bandhuṣu</i>) kings; it was first created by <i>Brahmán</i> and praised by <i>Śukra</i> (B. <i>Cakreṇa</i>); it is held by the sons of the Lord of waters. He showed him also <i>Varuṇa's</i> umbrella in the umbrella-house, always dropping water that cannot be seen. Innumerable are the wonders to be seen here (V. <b>98</b>). In the very centre of the <i>Nāgaloka</i> is the city <i>Pātāla</i> with <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Dānavas</i>, the <i>Asura</i> fire, fed by water; here the gods, having first vanquished their foes, quaffed the <i>amṛta</i> and deposited the residue; the <i>Āditya Hayaśiras</i>; from here <i>Airāvata</i> takes up water in order to impart it to the clouds, and it is that water which <i>Indra</i> pours down as rain; aquatic animals, the <i>timi</i>, etc., which subsist on the rays of the moon; here <i>Mahādeva</i> practised ascetic austerities for the benefit of all creatures; <i>maharṣis</i> addicted to the vow of <i>go (govratinaḥ</i>); here in the race of the celebrated elephant <i>Supratīka</i> were born the elephants <i>Airāvaṇa</i> (the king of his tribe), <i>Vāmana, Kumuda</i>, and <i>Añjana</i>; an egg in the waters from the commencement of the creation, whence, when the end of the world comes, a fire bursts forth and consumes the three worlds, etc. <i>Mātali</i> said: “No one here seems to be eligible” (V, <b>99</b>). In <i>Pātāla</i> is <i>Hiraṇyapura</i>, built by the <i>Dānava</i> (so PCR.; B. and C. <i>Viśvakarmaṇā</i>) <i>Maya</i>, belonging to the <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Dānavas</i>, who in days of yore lived here having obtained boons, exhibiting 1,000 different kinds of illusion, incapable of being vanquished by <i>Śakra</i>, <i>Yama, Varuṇa</i>, or <i>Kubera</i>, etc. The <i>Kālakhañjas</i> (<i>Asuras</i>, who sprang from <i>Viṣṇu(?</i>), so PCR.: <i>Asurāḥ Kālakhañjāś ca</i> <i>tathā Viṣṇupadodbhavāḥ</i>; C. <i>Kālaka°</i>) and the <i>Yātudhānas</i> (<i>Rākṣasas</i>, who sprang from the feet of <i>Brahmán(?</i>), so PCR.: <i>Nairṛtā Yātudhānāś ca Brahmapadodbhavāś ca ye</i>) (description); the <i>Nivātakavacas (Dānavas</i>); “many times, O <i>Mātali!</i> thou with thy son <i>Gomukha</i> and <i>Indra</i> hadst to retreat before them”; description of their abodes (the gems <i>arkasphaṭika, vajrasāra, padmarāga</i>, etc.). <i>Mātali</i> would not choose a son-in-law among the <i>Dānavas</i>, the enemies of the gods; “as regards thyself (i.e. Nārada), I know that thy heart is ever set on fomenting quarrels (<i>hiṃsātmakaṃ</i>)” (V, <b>100</b>). Then the world of the <i>Suparṇas</i>, who subsist on snakes and have sprung from the six sons of <i>Garuḍa</i>: <i>Sumukha</i>, etc. (α), of <i>Kaśyapa's</i> and <i>Vinatā's</i> race, adorned with the <i>Śrīvatsa</i>, belonging to the <i>kṣatriya</i> order, for they never attain to brahmanhood (<i>brāhmaṇyaṃ</i>) in consequence of their preying upon their kinsmen; they are shown favour by <i>Viṣṇu</i>, and adore <i>Viṣṇu</i>. The names of the principal are: <i>Suvarṇacūḍa</i>, etc. (β) (V, <b>101</b>). <i>Rasātala</i> is the seventh stratum below the earth; here dwells <i>Surabhī</i>, the mother of kine, born of the <i>amṛta</i>; her milk springs from the essence of the six different kinds of tastes; she sprang of old from the mouth of <i>Brahmán</i>, who was gratified with drinking the <i>amṛta</i> and vomited the best of things (i.e. the cow and the brahman, PCR.). A jet of her milk created the Milky Ocean (<i>kṣīranidhi</i>), covered with white foam that is the food of the ascetics (<i>munisattamāḥ) Phenapāḥ</i> (“Foamdrinkers”); the very gods fear them because of their austerities. From <i>Surabhī</i> are born the four kine that support the quarters (<i>diśāṃ pālyaḥ</i>): in the East <i>Surūpā</i>, in the South <i>Haṃsikā</i>, in the West <i>Subhadrā</i>, in the North (<i>dharmyām</i> <i>Ailavilasañjñitāṃ) Sarvakāmadughā</i>. The gods and the <i>Asuras</i>, making <i>Mandara</i> their pole, churned the Ocean, and obtained <i>Vāruṇī, Lakṣmī, amṛta, Uccaiḥśravas</i>, and <i>Kaustubha. Surabhī</i> milks <i>sudhā</i> to those who live on <i>sudhā</i> (i.e. the Nāgas, PCR.), <i>svadhā</i> to those who live on <i>svadhā</i> (i.e. the Pitṛs, PCR.), and <i>amṛta</i> to those who live on <i>amṛta</i> (i.e. the gods, PCR.). The <i>gāthā</i> that was sung by the dwellers of <i>Rasātala</i> in days of old is still heard to be recited in the world by persons of learning: “Neither in the <i>Nāga-loka</i>, nor in <i>Svarga</i>, nor in a <i>vimāna</i>, nor in heaven (<i>Tripiṣṭape</i>) is residence so happy as in <i>Rasātala</i>” (V, <b>102</b>). The city of <i>Bhogavatī</i> resembles <i>Indra's</i> city <i>Amarāvatī</i>; it is ruled over by <i>Vāsuki</i>, the king of the <i>Nāgas</i>; here dwells <i>Śeṣa (b</i>); here dwell the innumerable <i>Nāgas</i> (description), the sons of <i>Surasā</i>, wearing <i>svastika</i>, etc. The principal are <i>Vāsuki</i>, etc. (γ). <i>Mātali</i> wished to get for his son-in-law the <i>Nāga Sumukha</i> of <i>Airāvata's</i> race, the son of <i>Cikura</i> (who had been not long before slain by <i>Garuḍa</i>), and the grandson of <i>Āryaka Kauravya</i> and the daughter's son of <i>Vāmana</i> (V, <b>103</b>). <i>Nārada</i> introduced <i>Mātali</i> to <i>Āryaka</i> as the friend and charioteer of <i>Indra</i>, who drives his chariot drawn by 1,000 steeds, and thereby has vanquished the enemies of the gods. <i>Āryaka</i> objected that <i>Garuḍa</i>, who had slain <i>Cikura</i>, when he left these regions had said that after a month he would devour <i>Sumukha</i> also. According to a proposal of <i>Mātali</i>, they all visited <i>Indra</i> and <i>Viṣṇu</i>; <i>Viṣṇu</i> proposed to give <i>amṛta</i> to <i>Sumukha</i>; but <i>Indra</i> disagreed on account of the prowess of <i>Garuḍa</i>; instead he gave him an excellent lease of life, and having married <i>Mātali's</i> daughter he returned home (V, <b>104</b>). <i>Garuḍa</i> made remonstrances to <i>Indra</i>, saying that he, like him, can without any fatigue bear the weight of the three worlds; that he had slain the <i>Daityas Śrutaśrī</i>, etc. (δ); that he not only perches on <i>Viṣṇu's</i> flagstaff, but sometimes carries him with all his friends on his back, and he can carry <i>Viṣṇu</i> without fatigue on only one of his feathers. <i>Viṣṇu</i> shows him that he cannot bear the weight of his one right arm; then he threw <i>Sumukha</i> with the toe of his foot upon <i>Garuḍa's</i> breast. And from that time <i>Garuḍa</i> has ever lived (in friendship?) with that snake. <i>Kaṇva</i> continued: “In the same way, O <i>Duryodhana!</i> thou canst not encounter <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (ε).” <i>Duryodhana</i>, fixing his eyes on <i>Karṇa</i>, burst into laughter, saying: “I am precisely what the creator has made me” (V, <b>105</b>)."
