This name-ending was not known in the time of Pāṇini. According to Sankalia names directly after deities were probably after the family-god,<sup>23</sup> which in the present case seems to have been Śiva. It is possible that the first part of the name was connected with same deity and than the name of the family-deity was added as the name-ending surname. <dvsn n='P'/>The word nandin is generally used to refer to ‘an attendant of Śiva’ or the <i>vāhana ‘nandīn’</i> bull of Śiva. So the name Divākarnandin may literally mean ‘an attendant of god Sun’. The word <i>Nandin</i> also means ‘gladdening’.<sup>24</sup> So another interpretation can be ‘one who pleases or wins over Lord Sun’."
