The <i>Haihayas</i>, very afflicted, set out inquiring as to whose son the <i>muni</i> might be. Arriving at the hermitage of <i>Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi</i>, they told him the matter, and learnt that it was his son, and that he had been revived, because these <i>munis</i> had no fear of death, as they spoke well of <i>brahmans</i>, etc. (III, <b>184</b>).—§ 455: <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> continued: When the <i>rājarṣi Vainya</i> was performing the horse-sacrifice, <i>Atri</i> desired to go and ask him for alms, but gave up his desire of wealth and proposed to his wife and sons that they should all retire to the woods. His wife prevailed upon him that (though he had heard from <i>Gautama</i> that there were <i>brahmans</i> about <i>Vainya</i> who were jealous of him) he should first acquire riches and distribute them to his sons and servants, and so he went to <i>Vainya</i> and praised him as the foremost of sovereigns and the ruler of their destinies (<i>vidhātṛ</i>). The <i>ṛṣi Gautama</i> blamed him for thus flattering the king, and said that it was <i>Indra</i> who was the foremost of sovereigns and ruler of their destinies (<i>vidhātṛ</i>). The <i>munis</i> (having let the pious <i>Kāśyapa</i> inquire about the matter) applied to <i>Sanatkumāra</i>, who said that the <i>brahmans</i> and <i>kṣattriyas</i> ought to act together, and that the king (enumeration of honourable appellations) might rightly be styled as <i>Atri</i> had done. <i>Vainya</i> then gave to <i>Atri</i> 1000 maidservants and 100 millions of gold [coins] and ten <i>bhāras</i> of gold. Having given this to his sons <i>Atri</i> retired to the forest (III, <b>185</b>)."
