[Arjuna was so called because he was ‘white’ or ‘pure in actions’ (पृथिव्यां <lbinfo n='caturaM#tAyAM'/> चतुरंतायां वर्णोमे दुर्लभः समः । करोमि कर्म शुद्धं च तेन मामर्जुनं विदुः). He was taught the use of arms by Droṇa and was his favourite pupil. By his skill in arms he won <lbinfo n='Drau+padī'/> Draupadī at her Svayaṃvara (see Draupadī). For an involuntary transgression he went into temporary exile and during that time he learnt the science of arms from Paraśurāma. He married Ulūpī, a Nāga Princess, by whom he had a son named Irāvat, and also Citrāṅgadā, daughter of the king of Maṇipura, who bore him a son named Babhruvāhana. During this exile he visited Dvārakā, and with the help and advice of Kṛṣṇa succeeded in marrying Subhadrā. By her he had a son named Abhimanyu. Afterwards he obtained the bow Gāṇḍīva from the god Agni whom he assisted in burning the Khāṇḍava forest. When Dharma, his eldest brother, lost the <lbinfo n='king+dom'/> kingdom by gambling, and the five brothers went into exile, he went to the <lbinfo n='Himā+layas'/> Himālayas to propitiate the gods and to obtain from them celestial weapons for use in the contemplated war against the Kauravas. There he fought with Śiva who <lbinfo n='appear+ed'/> appeared in the disguise of a Kirāta; but when he discovered the true character of his adversary he worshipped him and Śiva gave him the Pāśupatāstra. Indra, Varuṇa, Yama and Kubera also <lbinfo n='present+ed'/> presented him with their own weapons. In the 13th year of their exile, the <lbinfo n='Pāṇḍa+vas'/> Pāṇḍavas entered the service of the King of Virāṭa and he had to act the part of a cunuch, and music and dancing master. In the great war with the Kauravas <lbinfo n='Ar+juna'/> Arjuna took a very distinguished part. He secured the assistance of <lbinfo n='Kṛsh+ṇa'/> Kṛshṇa who acted as his charioteer and <lbinfo n='re+lated'/> related to him the Bhagavadgītā when on the first day of the battle he hesitated to bend his bow against his own kinsmen. In the course of the great struggle he slew or vanquished several redoubtable warriors on the side of the Kauravas, such as Jayadratha, Bhīṣma, Karṇa &c. After Yudhiṣṭhira had been installed sovereign of Hastināpura, he <lbinfo n='re+solved'/> resolved to perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice, and a horse was let loose with Arjuna as its guardian. Arjuna followed it through many cities and countries and fought with many kings. At the city of Maṇipura he had to fight with his own son <lbinfo n='Babhru+vāhana'/> Babhruvāhana and was killed; but he was <lbinfo n='restor+ed'/> restored to life by a charm supplied by his wife Ulūpī. He traversed the whole of Bharata khaṇḍa and returned to Hastināpura, loaded with spoils and tributes, and the great horse-sacrifice was then duly performed. He was afterwards called by Kṛṣṇa to Dvārakā amid the intestine struggles of the Yādavas and there he performed the funeral ceremonies of Vasudeva and Kṛṣṇa. Soon after this the five Pāṇḍavas repaired to heaven having installed Parīkṣit-the only surviving son of Abhimanyu-on the throne of <lbinfo n='Hast+ināpura'/> Hastināpura. Arjuna was the bravest of the Pāṇḍavas, high-minded, generous, <lbinfo n='up+right'/> upright, handsome and the most prominent figure of all his brothers. He has several appellations, such as Pārtha, Guḍākeśa, Savyasācī, Dhanaṃjaya, Phālguna, <lbinfo n='Ki+rīṭin'/> Kirīṭin, Jiṣṇu, Śvetavāhana, Gāṇḍīvin &c. &c.] <b>--6</b> <ab>N.</ab> of Kārtavīrya, slain by Paraśurāma.

The gods and ṛṣis asked Viṣṇu to kill him. On his celestial vimāna. Arjuna affronted Indra, when he was sporting with Śaśī. After having held a consultation with Indra, Viṣṇu went to his hermitage Badarī (for continuation v. Jamadagni), 10135 (<i>Haihayādhipatiḥ</i>), 10140.—§ 397 (Jamadagni): III, <b>116</b>: Once, when the sons of Jamadagni had gone out, Arjuna Kārtavīrya, the lord of the country near the sea-shore (<i>Anūpapatiḥ</i>), came to the hermitage, and, being received hospitably by Reṇukā (the wife of Jamadagni), carried off the calf of the <i>homadhenu</i> and pulled down the trees. As Jamadagni told Rāma this, Rāma rushed towards Arjuna, and cut down his 1,000 arms with his arrows, and killed him. The heirs of Arjuna came while Rāma was away, and shot Jamadagni to death with their arrows. When they had gone away Rāma returned to the hermitage (III, <b>116</b>), 10195.— § 398 (Paruśa-Rāma): III, <b>117</b>: After having lamented for and cremated his father, Rāma vowed the slaughter of the entire kṣattriya caste, killed Kārtavīrya's sons, etc.—§ 638<i>b</i> (Rāmop.): XII, <b>49</b>: Meanwhile the virtuous kṣattriya, the Haihaya king Arjuna Kārtavīrya, with 1,000 arms through the grace of Dattātreya, having subjugated the whole earth with its mountains and seven islands, became a powerful emperor, and gave away the earth to the brahmans in a horse-sacrifice. Solicited by Agni, he once gave alms to that deity, who sprung from the point of his shaft, i.e. Agni burnt villages, etc., and he burnt also the retreat of Āpava (= Vasiṣṭha), who cursed Arjuna, saying that Rāma should lop off his arms. Always devoted to peace, always regardful of brahmans, etc., Arjuna did not mind that curse. His sons, always haughty and cruel, seized and brought away the calf of Jamadagni's <i>homa-</i>cow, without the knowledge of Arjuna. Rāma lopped off the arms of Arjuna and brought back the calf; the sons of Arjuna came and slew Jamadagni in the absence of Rāma, who vowed to free the earth of kṣattriyas, and slaughtered all the sons and grandsons of Arjuna, and 1,000 Haihayas, and freed the earth of all kṣattriyas, etc., 1750 (<i>Kṛtavīryātmajo, Haiha-</i> <i>yādhipaḥ</i>), 1757, 1758, 1759, 1763, 1764 (<i>°sya sutāḥ</i>).— § 772<i>b</i> (Pavanārjunas.): XIII, <b>153</b><i>ff</i> : The Haihaya king Arjuna Kārtavīrya with 1,000 arms became the lord of this whole world (i.e. the earth), residing in Māhiṣmatī; he gave large gifts to Dattātreya, who granted him four boons: that he should have 1,000 arms in battle, but only two at home; that he should subjugate the whole earth righteously; and reign with vigilance; and that whenever he might happen to go wrong, the righteous should set him right. <i>A</i>. now regarded himself as having no equal. An invisible voice said that the brahman is superior to the kṣattriya; <i>A</i>. maintained that the brahmans take refuge with the kṣattriyas; “I shall bring the skin-clad brahmans under my sway.” Vāyu (Wind) warned <i>A.</i>, addressing him from the air, etc. At last Arjuna praised the brahmans, mentioning Dattātreya.

After Pāṇḍu had been cursed, that he should have no progeny, he caused Dharma to procreate Yudhiṣṭhira in Kuntī, then Vāyu to procreate Bhīmasena, and then Indra to procreate Arjuna.— § 190<i>d</i> (Pāṇḍavotp.): I, <b>123</b>: In order to propitiate <i>Indra</i> (before summoning him), <i>Pāṇḍu</i>, took counsel with the <i>maharṣis</i>, and caused <i>Kuntī</i> to observe an auspicious vow for a full year, while he himself began to stand upon one leg, etc. After the birth of <i>A</i>. a bodyless voice said that he should subjugate the <i>Madras</i>, the <i>Kurus</i>, the <i>Somakas</i>, the <i>Cedis</i>, <i>Kāśis</i>, and <i>Karūṣas</i>, and satiate <i>Havyavāhana</i> (Fire) in the <i>Khāṇḍava</i> wood with the fat of all beings, and, with his brothers, perform three sacrifices; in battle he would gratify <i>Śaṅkara</i>, and receive from him the <i>Pāśupata</i> weapon, and, at the command of <i>Indra</i>, slay the <i>Nivātakavacas</i>, and acquire all sorts of celestial weapons: 4791, 4795.—§ 191: On hearing this voice, the ascetics dwelling on <i>Śataśṛṅga</i> became exceedingly glad. There was heard the sound of <i>dundubhis</i>, and flowers were showered down. The various tribes of celestials (<i>devagaṇāḥ</i>), etc. (α), came there (enumeration, among others, of <i>Devagandharvas, Apsarases</i>, the twelve <i>Ādityas</i>, the <i>Rudras</i>, the <i>Vainateyas</i>). Then the Aśvins procreated the twins Nakula and Sahadeva in Mādrī.— § 192 (Pāṇḍavotp.): I, <b>124</b>, 4854 (the third son of Kuntī). Having been procreated on Śataśṛṅga in behalf of Pāṇḍu by the gods Dharma (Yudhiṣṭhira), Vāyu (Bhīmasena), Indra (Arjuna; the mother of these three was Kuntī), and the Aśvins (Nakula and Sahadeva, who were twins and sons of Mādrī) in Pāṇḍu's wives Kuntī and Mādrī, the five Pāṇḍavas after the death of Pāṇḍu were brought to Hāstinapura and educated by Droṇa, under the supervision of Bhīṣma. Their cousins (the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra) hated them, especially Duryodhana, who tried to murder Bhīmasena and later on all the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī (Mādrī had burnt herself with the corpse of Pāṇḍu), and Karṇa hated Arjuna from jealousy.—§ 203<i>b</i> (cf. Droṇa): I, <b>132</b>: One day <i>Droṇa</i> asked his pupils to promise to accomplish what he had on his heart; only <i>Arjuna</i> promised it. <i>Arjuna</i> became the foremost of all his fellow-pupils. <i>Droṇa</i> gave every one of his pupils a narrow-mouthed vessel (<i>kamaṇḍalu</i>) for fetching water, in order that much time might be spent in filling it, but to <i>Aśvatthāman</i> he gave a broad-mouthed vessel (<i>kumbha</i>), and in the intervals so gained he used to instruct his son in several superior methods; but <i>Arjuna</i> filled the vessel by means of the <i>Vāruṇa</i> weapon, and used to come at the same time as <i>Aśvatthāman. Droṇa</i> told the cook never to give <i>Arjuna</i> his food in the dark, but not to tell him that it was he (<i>Droṇa</i>) that had ordered this. One day a wind put the lamp out when <i>Arjuna</i> was taking his food; but his hand went up to his mouth from habit. His attention being thus called to the force of habit, <i>Arjuna</i> practised with his bow in the night, and <i>Droṇa</i> promised him that there should not be a bowman equal to him in the world. He taught him also to fight on horseback, etc., with the mace, etc.: 5217, 5218, 5224, 5225, 5230, 5232, 5233, 5238.—§ 204 (Ekalavya): I, <b>132</b>, 5252 (Droṇa took from Ekalavya as his fee the thumb of his right hand in order that he might not surpass Arjuna).—§ 205<i>e</i> (cf. Droṇa): I, <b>132</b>, 5273, 5274: Arjuna excelled everyone in every respect, and alone became an <i>atiratha</i> (“a charioteer capable of fighting at one time with 60,000 foes,” PCR.).—§ 206 (Droṇa): I, <b>132</b><i>f</i>, 5293, 5296. One day Droṇa caused an artificial bird to be placed on the top of a tree, and first repeatedly asked Yudhiṣṭhira to tell what he did see, while aiming at the bird. He answered that he saw the tree, Droṇa, his brothers, and the bird. Droṇa reproachfully told him to stand apart. Then Droṇa repeated the experiment with his other pupils, with the same result (ch. <b>132</b>). At last Arjuna's turn came; he said first that he saw only the vulture, and then that he saw only its head, and, when Droṇa gave the order, he struck off its head with his shaft (I, <b>133</b>).—§ 207 (do.): I, <b>133</b>: Arjuna rescued the life of Droṇa by shooting with five arrows an alligator in the Gaṅgā that had seized his thigh. Droṇa gave him the weapon Brahmaśiras on the condition that he should not use it against a human foe, as it might burn the whole universe. —§ 208<i>b</i> (cf. Astradarśana): I, <b>135</b>: Then <i>Arjuna</i> appeared, while <i>Kuntī</i> wept with joy, and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> learned from <i>Vidura</i> who it was. By the <i>Āgneya</i> weapon <i>Arjuna</i> created fire, by the <i>Vāruṇa</i> water, by the <i>Vāyavya</i> air, by the <i>Pārjanya</i> clouds; by means of the <i>Pārvata</i> a mountain came into being (v. 5366, read with V. <i>“abhavadgiriḥ”</i> or with B. <i>“asṛjadgirīn”</i>), and by the <i>Antardhāna</i> weapon it again disappeared, etc.; he at one time shot five shafts together into the mouth of a moving iron boar, and discharged twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow's horn hung up in a rope and swaying to and fro (v. 5370, instead of <i>“bale”</i> read with B. and V. <i>“cale”</i>).—§ 208 (Astradarśana): I, <b>137</b>, 5440, 5442: At the show of arms Karṇa in vain challenged Arjuna.—§ 209 (Drupadaśāsana): I, <b>138</b>, 5484, 5492, 5499, 5500, 5501. Arjuna helped Droṇa to subjugate Drupada, which favour Droṇa had asked as his fee.— § 210<i>c</i> (cf. Sambhavaparvan): I, <b>139</b>: <i>Droṇa</i> taught <i>Arjuna</i> Brahmaśiras (that he had learnt from <i>Agniveśa</i>, the disciple of <i>Agastya</i>), on the condition that he should not hurl it at any human being (cf. § 207), and obtained from him as his fee the promise that he would fight with him [in the great battle]. Then <i>Arjuna</i> went away to the northern region.—§ 211 (Sambhavap.): I, <b>139</b>, 5537, 5538. Headed by Arjuna, the Pāṇḍavas in war slew Sauvīra, who had performed a three years' sacrifice at the inroad of the Gandharvas. The Yavana king, whom even Pāṇḍu had failed to subject, was subdued by Arjuna; as was also the Sauvīra Vitula (B. <i>Vipula</i>), who had always shown a disregard for the Kurus; and the Sauvīra Sumitra, called Dattāmitra (LIA. i, pp. 656/804, n. 2); assisted by Bhīma, Arjuna with only a single chariot subjugated all the kings of the east (<i>prācyāḥ</i>) backed by 10,000 chariots; and in the same way the south. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sentiments towards the Pāṇḍavas suddenly became poisoned, and from anxiety he could not sleep (I, <b>139</b>).—§ 213 (Jatugṛhap.): I, <b>151</b>, 5911 (has escaped from the lac house).—§ 214 (Hiḍimbav.): I, <b>154</b>, 6019, (6027), (6034), 6039 (<i>A</i>. offered to assist Bhīmasena against Hiḍimba, and exhorted him to kill him without delay; then he caused the Pāṇḍavas to proceed to a town not far off); <b>156</b>, 6096.—§ 217 (Caitrarathap.): I, <b>166</b>, 6346 (a brahman related how Bhīṣma prevailed upon Droṇa to teach the princes, etc.; both Arjuna and the others promised to do whatever he might ask as his fee, etc.).— § 219 (do.): I, <b>168</b>, 6419 (the brothers set out for the town of Drupada).—§ 221 (do.): I, <b>170</b>, (6451), (6462), (6472), 6474, (6493), 6499 (while the Pāṇḍavas were wandering from Ekacakrā to the town of the Pāñcālas, Arjuna walking before them torch in hand, the Gandharva king Citraratha opposed them at the Gaṅgā, but was vanquished by Arjuna, whom he then gave the Gandharvic māyā called Cākṣuṣī, and on whom and each of his brothers he bestowed 100 Gandharva horses; he gave them the counsel to select a fit purohita; Arjuna in return gave him the Āgneya weapon).— § 222 (Tapatyup.): I, <b>171</b>, (6516) (as Citraratha had called <i>A</i>.

An incorporeal voice said that Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, being really the old ṛṣis and gods Nara and Nārāyaṇa, were invincible.

Duryodhana had chosen Karṇa as the antagonist of Arjuna. Kṛṣṇa described Arjuna's banner, made by Bhaumana by means of celestial illusion; his Aindra, Āgneya, and Māruta weapons, etc. Karṇa promised Kuntī, that except Arjuna, her other sons should not be slain by him.—§ 570 (Sainyaniryānap.): V, <b>151—159</b>: <b>153</b>, 5197; <b>154</b>, 5232; <b>157</b>, 5318, 5328: At the commencement of the battle Anādhṛṣṭi, etc. (ζ), marched surrounding Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, all of them blowing their conchs on entering Kurukṣetra.

Bhīṣma said that he did not know of any warrior upon earth who was equal to him, except Arjuna; but Arjuna would never openly fight with him. Karṇa wanted to fight with Arjuna, but not before Bhīṣma was slain. Arjuna “of curly hair” was made the leader of all the leaders of the Pāṇḍava army, and Kṛṣṇa the leader of Arjuna and the driver of his steeds. Bhīṣmaka's son Rukmin offered Arjuna his assistance if he was afraid; <i>A.</i>, mentioning his exploits, and that he had paid his homage to Rudra, etc. (ν), for battle's sake, would not say he was afraid.—§ 571 (Ulūkadūt.): V, <b>160—164: 160</b>, 5460, 5513; <b>161</b>, 5558; <b>162</b>, 5578, 5586, 5640; <b>163</b>, 5651, 5695, 5697; <b>164</b>, 5704, 5706: Ulūka had to state before <i>A</i>. that among the Kuru troops were the Kāmbojas, etc. (γ); “I know that thy Gāṇḍīva is full 6 cubits long”; Ulūka repeated the statement to the Pāṇḍavas, etc., and once more repeated his words to <i>A.; A</i>. said that Duryodhana's contrivance of seeking cover behind Bhīṣma would be of no avail, as he would himself slay Bhīṣma.—§ 572 (Rathātirathas.): V, <b>165—172: 172</b>, 5935.—§ 573 (Ambop.): V, <b>173—196: 185</b>, 7308; <b>193</b>, 7560; <b>194</b>, 7587: “<i>A</i>. had been ordained by Svayambhū to slay Bhīṣma.” Karṇa having said that he could annihilate Bhīma and Arjuna in the course of five nights, Bhīṣma ridiculed him, saying that he would think otherwise when he had encountered Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa; to Yudhiṣṭhira Arjuna said that with Kṛṣṇa as his ally he might exterminate the three worlds with the gods, etc., in the twinkling of an eye, etc. In the array of Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma and Arjuna were in the second division, then, with Kṛṣṇa, in the middle division together with Virāṭa, etc.—§ 576 (Bhagavadg.): VI, <b>13—42</b>: <b>19</b>, 713, (714), 723; <b>20</b>, 754, 759; <b>21</b>, 761, 765; <b>22</b>, 785; <b>23</b>, 793, 795, (796), 813; <b>25</b>, 833, 878; <b>26</b>, 880, 923, (932); <b>27</b>, (951), 957, (986); <b>28</b>, (997), 998, 1002, 1030; <b>29</b>, 1036; <b>30</b>, 1080, 1096, (1097), (1101), 1110; <b>31</b>, 1127, 1137; <b>32</b>, (1142), 1157, 1168; <b>34</b>, (1216), 1236, 1243, 1246; <b>35</b>, (1247), 1293, 1296, (1297), 1300; <b>36</b>, (1302); <b>37</b>, (1322); <b>38</b>, (1375); <b>41</b>, (1427); <b>42</b>, (1455), 1463, 1515, (1527), 1530: Yudhiṣṭhira told Arjuna to array the troops in a needle-mouthed (<i>śucīmukha</i>) array in conformity with the words of M.-ṛ.

Yudhiṣṭhira sorrowfully addressed Arjuna, who consoled him, mentioning his truthful— ness, righteousness, etc. At Kṛṣṇa's instance Arjuna recited a hymn to Dūrgā, who appeared and gave him assurance of victory. Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to place his chariot between the two armies, so that he might see who had assembled to fight. Beholding his relatives, etc., Arjuna was filled with compassion and overcome with despondency, and refused to fight. Kṛṣṇa appeals to Arjuna to shake off his despondency, but in vain. Kṛṣṇa then explained to Arjuna the nature and the attributes of the soul, and the folly of grieving for the dead, and exhorted him to fulfil the duties of his caste by fighting like a man, and to concern himself with work for work's sake and not for the sake of its results, etc. (Bhagavadgītā).

Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna to fight Bhīṣma; he and Arjuna were both wounded by Bhīṣma, and the Pāṇḍava army was routed; Bhīṣma ordered Droṇa, etc. (μ), to attack Arjuna; the grandson of Śini (i.e. Sātyaki = Yuyudhāna) came to Arjuna's assistance. Kṛṣṇa jumped down from the chariot with his discus Sudarśana in his hand, and rushed towards Bhīṣma, but was held back by Arjuna; then Duryodhana, etc. (ν), attacked Arjuna, who invoked the Māhendra weapon and checked the Kaurava host; <i>A</i>. then produced a river of blood, with Rākṣasa on its banks. At sunset the Kurus (Bhīṣma, etc.) withdrew their forces; Arjuna did the same.

(§ 582<i>b</i>, VI, <b>71</b>): <i>A.'s</i> standard bore the device of a lion's tail and looked like a blazing mountain in the welkin…of celestial workmanship…with various hues; looking like a rising comet it could not be obstructed by trees. The Kurus were afraid and seemed to melt away. Arjuna encountered Droṇa (ζ). Duryodhana urged 25,000 to slay Arjuna, who, however, slew them all. The Matsyas and Kekayas surrounded Arjuna and Abhimanyu.

When the Kuru army had been routed by Arjuna, and Bhīṣma had proceeded against the chariot of Arjuna, Duryodhana exhorted the kings to protect Bhīṣma. Fighting with Alambuṣa, Sātyaki employed the Aindra weapon which he had obtained from Arjuna, and destroyed the productions of Alambuṣa's illusive force. Arjuna caused Kṛṣṇa to drive the chariot towards Bhīṣma; <i>A</i>. fought with Suśarman, and slew many. The Trigarta king and thirty-two others attacked Arjuna, who slew sixty of them and then hastened to slay Bhīṣma. The Trigarta king attacking Arjuna, Śikhaṇḍin, etc., came to his aid.

Arjuna, etc., slew many; he complained of Irāvat's death before Kṛṣṇa; he fought Bhīṣma, etc. (ηη). When dark night set in, both parties withdrew their armies. “Yudhāmanyu protects Arjuna's left wheel, Uttamaujas his right wheel, and Arjuna protects Śikhaṇḍin”; <i>A</i>. told Dhṛṣṭadyumna to place Śikhaṇḍin before Bhīṣma; he would himself be his protector.—§ 586 (do.), VI, <b>99—107</b>: NINTH DAY: <b>101</b>, 4589, 4597, 4622, 4642; <b>102</b>, 4650, 4655; <b>104</b>, 4729; <b>106</b>, 4848, 4871; <b>107</b>, 4912, 4924, 4968, 4976, (4989): <i>A</i>. fought Bhīṣma, Kṛpa, and Droṇa; then the Trigarta king and his son; <i>A</i>. employed the Vāyavya weapon; the Trigarta division turned their backs; Duryodhana, etc. (ι), surrounded <i>A</i>. <i>A</i>. slew all the followers of Suśarman; fought Duryodhana.

The Pāṇḍavas and Kṛṣṇa went away with rejoicing hearts.—§ 587 (do.), VI, <b>108—120</b>: TENTH DAY: <b>108</b>, 5011; <b>110</b>, 5094, 5114, 5115, 5125, 5139; <b>111</b>, 5195; <b>112</b>, 5213, 5218; <b>113</b>, 5284, 5287, 5289, 5290; <b>114</b>, 5298, 5308, 5324; <b>115</b>, 5340, 5341; <b>116</b>, 5428, 5429, 5430, 5433, 5434, 5435; <b>117</b>, 5455, 5459, 5465, 5470, 5472; <b>119</b>, 5627, 5632, 5642: The Pāṇḍavas went out for battle, placing Śikhaṇḍin in their van; Bhīmasena and Arjuna became the protectors of his wheels, etc.; headed by Arjuna, they proceeded against Bhīṣma; Arjuna urged Śikhaṇḍin to slay Bhīṣma, while he himself would check Droṇa, etc. (δ); <i>A</i>. defeated the Kuru army; Duryodhana complained of <i>A</i>. before Bhīṣma, etc. Urged by <i>A.</i>, Śikhaṇḍin, etc., attacked Bhīṣma; Duḥśāsana attacked Arjuna and Śikhaṇḍin; <i>A</i>. could not advance further than to the chariot of Duḥśāsana; <i>A</i>. compelled Duḥśāsana to turn back, and then crushed the Kuru troops; Duḥśāsana again resisted him; Arjuna and Śikhaṇḍin approached Bhīma (for aid); Duryodhana urged the Trigarta king Suśarman to slay Arjuna and Bhīmasena; <i>A</i>. fought Śalya, etc. (κ); Droṇa, etc., fought Arjuna and Bhīmasena; so did Bhīṣma; Droṇa, etc., (ξ), fought the Pārthas, especially Arjuna, etc. (ο); the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra fought with Śikhaṇḍin and <i>A.; A</i>. fought with Bhīṣma and Bhagadatta, and urged Śikhaṇḍin to slay Bhīṣma; the Kurus attacked Arjuna; no chariot-warrior ventured to approach Bhīṣma except Arjuna and Śikhaṇḍin; Bhīṣma did not defend himself against Śikhaṇḍin, whom Arjuna urged quickly to slay Bhīṣma; Duḥśāsana fought with Arjuna and all the Pārthas, but was vanquished by <i>A.</i>; the Videhas, etc. (ρ), attacked Arjuna, who defeated them all by means of celestial weapons; then <i>A</i>. fought with Duḥśāsana, etc., Bhīṣma, etc.; Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. to slay Bhīṣma; the Pāñcāla king Dhṛṣṭaketu, etc. (υ), were afflicted by Bhīṣma and rescued by Arjuna; protected by Arjuna, Śikhaṇḍin rushed against Bhīṣma; <i>A</i>. slew all Bhīṣma's followers, and then rushed at him himself; Droṇa, etc. (employing celestial weapons), fought with <i>A.</i>; Bhīṣma said to Duḥśāsana that <i>A</i>. was invincible, and that he himself was not able to be vanquished by D., Dā., and Rā.; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons surrounded Bhīṣma, but fled before Arjuna. Bhīṣma fell down from his chariot a little before sunset, but put off his death, as the sun was in the southern solstice; both parties desisted from battle; as Bhīṣma's head hung down he asked for a pillow; Arjuna supported his head with three arrows shot from the Gāṇḍīva and consecrated by means of mantras, at which Bhīma was highly gratified.—§ 588 (do.), VI, <b>121—122</b>: ELEVENTH DAY: <b>121</b>, 5776, 5780, 5781: The next morning, as Bhīṣma asked for water, Arjuna mounted his chariot and from the Gāṇḍīva shot an arrow consecrated with mantras and identified with the Pārjanya weapon, therewith piercing the earth, and there arose a jet of pure and cold water; Bhīṣma praised Arjuna: “even Nārada spoke of thee as an ancient ṛṣi…”; he said to Duryodhana that the weapons appertaining to Agni, etc., were known only to Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. Bhīṣma tried to win over Karṇa to the side of his uterine brothers, but he said that he would fight Arjuna, etc., though protected by Kṛṣṇa.—§ 589 (Droṇābhiṣ.), VII, <b>1—11: 2</b>, 67, 82; <b>3</b>, 110; <b>6</b>, 164; <b>7</b>, 197; <b>8</b>, 226; <b>10</b>, 327; <b>11</b>, 419, 422: Karṇa waited upon Bhīṣma, mentioning the danger menacing the Kurus from Arjuna with the Gāṇḍīva, etc., Arjuna's battle with Śiva, etc. Yudhiṣṭhira disposed his troops in the form of a krauñca (crane), with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna at the head. The Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjaya were defeated by Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira asked <i>A</i>. to check Droṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra regretted that Duryodhana did not know Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.—§ 590 (do.), VII, <b>12—16</b>: ELEVENTH DAY (Sañjaya begins his narrative in detail): <b>12</b>, 453; <b>13</b>, (472): Droṇa promised to seize Yudhiṣṭhira, if he was not protected by Arjuna (with his weapons received from Indra and Rudra, etc.); Arjuna must therefore be withdrawn from Yudhiṣṭhira. Yudhiṣṭhira learnt through his spies that Droṇa had promised to seize him; <i>A</i>. consoled him. A fierce battle commenced; protected by Droṇa and Arjuna, both hosts seemed to stand inactive. In order to rescue Yudhiṣṭhira, <i>A</i>. attacked Droṇa's division. When the sun set, both parties withdrew their troops. The Pāṇḍavas, etc., praised Arjuna.—§ 591 (Saṃśaptakavadhap.), VII, <b>17</b>, 680, 688, 709: Droṇa confessed his inability of seizing Yudhiṣṭhira if Arjuna were by; the Trigarta king, saying that Arjuna had always injured them, said that they would take an oath that either Arjuna or the Trigartas should be slain. Then they summoned Arjuna to the southern part of the field. Arjuna told Satyajit to guard Yudhiṣṭhira, and went out against the Trigartas.—§ 592 (do.), VII, <b>18—32</b>: TWELFTH DAY: <b>18</b>, 728, 733, 734, 736, 737; <b>19</b>, 753, 756, 763, 764, 765, 770, 773; <b>23</b>, 1017; <b>26</b>, 1130; <b>27</b>, 1208, 1212, 1219; <b>28</b>, 1232, 1234, 1235, 1241; <b>29</b>, 1265, 1266, 1274; <b>30</b>, 1303, 1306, 1312, 1319, 1321, 1324, 1325, 1326, 1328, 1329, 1336, 1339; <b>32</b>, 1418, 1423, 1426, 1428, 1443: The Saṃśaptakas rejoiced at the prospect of fighting with <i>A.</i>, who terrified them with the sound of Devadatta, and attacked them; Subāhu and Suśarman, etc. (α), fought with <i>A.</i>; they fled to Duryodhana, but, urged by the Trigarta king, they once more returned to the field with the Nārāyaṇa cowherds. Kṛṣṇa conveyed Arjuna to the Saṃśaptakas. The Nārāyaṇas fought with Arjuna. <i>A</i>. blew the Devadatta and employed the Tvāṣṭra weapon, that confounded the foes, who began to strike each other; Arjuna crossed the Lalitthas, etc. (β), and used the Vāyavya weapon to frustrate the downpour of arrows shot by his foes, and Vāyu bore away crowds of Saṃśaptakas with their steeds, etc. Yudhiṣṭhira disposed his troops in the form of a semicircle. Yudhiṣṭhira fled. Arjuna's son Śrutakīrti fought with the son of Duḥśāsana. <i>A.</i>, etc. (υ), fought with Bhagadatta (upon his elephant). Urged by Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa began to proceed against Bhagadatta; the Saṃśaptakas (14,000, including 10,000 Gopālāḥ or Nārāyaṇāḥ) challenged Arjuna, and he encountered them, discharged the Brāhma weapon, defeated and slew them, and then turned against Bhagadatta; but as Suśarman with his brothers followed him from behind, he again attacked Suśarman, and then again Bhagadatta; Bhagadatta, at last, consecrated his hook with mantras so as to become the Vaiṣṇava weapon; Kṛṣṇa received it on his breast, and it became a garland. As <i>A</i>. taxed Kṛṣṇa for fighting himself, Kṛṣṇa related the history of the Vaiṣṇavāstra (<i>c</i>); “the great Asura has now been divested of that supreme weapon; now slay Bhagadatta, that enemy of the gods, just as I formerly slew the Asura Naraka for the good of the worlds”; <i>A</i>. then slew both Bhagadatta and the elephant. Then <i>A</i>. slew the two brothers Vṛṣa and Acala. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons attacked Arjuna, and Śakuni employed magics in order to confound him and Kṛṣṇa: producing clubs, etc., and asses, etc., which <i>A</i>. slew with celestial weapons; then darkness, whence harsh voices were heard; this <i>A</i>. dispelled with the weapon Jyotiṣka; then waves of water, which were dried up with the Āditya weapon; Śakuni fled. <i>A</i>. slaughtered the Kuru army: some followed Droṇa, others Duryodhana; a fierce battle took place on the southern side between Arjuna and the Kurus. The Pāṇḍavas regretted that Arjuna was engaged on the southern part of the field in slaughtering the Saṃśaptakas and the Nārāyaṇa force. Having slain the Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna fought with Droṇa, etc., employing the Āgneya weapon; <i>A</i>. slew three of Karṇa's brothers (γγ). At sunset the armies retired.—§ 593 (Abhimanyuvadhap.), VII, <b>33—51</b>: THIRTEENTH DAY: <b>33</b>, 1456, 1466, 1468; <b>35</b>, 1520, 1521; <b>36</b>, 1545; <b>40</b>, 1661; <b>45</b>, 1824; <b>51</b>, 1989, 1991: Being overcome by <i>A.</i>, and Droṇa having failed to seize Yudhiṣṭhira, the Kurus were regarded as defeated; they heard everybody praise <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa. Next morning Duryodhana blamed Droṇa for not having seized Yudhiṣṭhira; Droṇa said that nobody could defeat the force protected by Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa, save Mahādeva. The Saṃśaptakas challenged Arjuna and took him away to the southern side of the field. The Pāṇḍavas were headed by Bhīmasena. Abhimanyu defeated all the warriors that encountered him with the weapons he had received from Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. At last Abhimanyu was slain by Duḥśāsana's son, after Jayadratha had checked those who tried to follow Abhimanyu.—§ 595 (do.), VII, <b>71</b>, 2465: Vyāsa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira, who became free from grief; but “what shall we say to Arjuna?” —§ 596 (Pratijñāp.), VII, <b>72—81: 72</b>, 2485, 2537, 2562, 2563; <b>73</b>, 2581, 2610; <b>74</b>, 2636, 2637; <b>75</b>, 2666, 2667, 2672; <b>76</b>, (2679), 2704; <b>77</b>, 2716; <b>78</b>, 2774; <b>79</b>, 2775, 2787, 2790, 2791, 2795, 2799, 2801, 2803, 2808; <b>80</b>, 2842, 2868, 2872, (2874), 2885; <b>81</b>, 2889, 2895, 2905, 2909: In the evening Arjuna, after having slain large numbers of Saṃśaptakas, proceeded towards his tent and told Kṛṣṇa that his heart was afflicted; he saw indications of disaster; Abhimanyu did not come out with smiles to receive him, etc. He remembered that Droṇa had this day formed the circular array, which none save Abhimanyu could break; but he had not taught him how to come out of it after having pierced it; he had heard the leonine shouts of the Dhārtarāṣṭras, and Kṛṣṇa had heard Yuyutsu censuring them for having slain a child instead of Arjuna, and then Yuyutsu had cast up his weapons afflicted with rage and grief. Kṛṣṇa consoled Arjuna, talking about the kṣattriya duties and heaven. None save Kṛṣṇa and Yudhiṣṭhira (who were always acceptable to him) could address Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira addressed him and told (VII, <b>72</b>) him the particulars of Abhimanyu's heroism and fall. Arjuna vowed to slay Jayadratha before the sun set the following day (his oath); even as to As., D., men, birds, snakes, P., wanderers of the night, B.-ṛ., and D.-ṛ., etc., he said that they would not succeed in protecting him, even if he entered Rasātala, or ascended the firmament, or repaired to the city of the gods (<i>Devapuraṃ</i>) or the city of Diti (<i>Diteḥ puraṃ</i>); if the sun set before he had slain him, he would himself enter the fire. Arjuna bent the Gāṇḍīva, Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñcajanya, Arjuna the Devadatta (VII, <b>73</b>). Having been informed by spies, Jayadratha was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear, thinking that not even Droṇa (α), not even D., G., As., U., Rā., could protect him against Arjuna. He wished to return home. Duryodhana comforted him saying that he, Karṇa, etc. (β), would protect him. Accompanied by Duryodhana, Jayadratha that very night repaired to Droṇa and questioned him about the difference between himself and Arjuna. Droṇa said they had got the same instruction, but Arjuna was superior to Jayadratha in consequence of yoga and the hard life he had led; Droṇa would, however, protect him, forming an impenetrable array; and, moreover, death ought not to be an object of terror to him (VII, <b>74</b>). Kṛṣṇa remonstrated with <i>A</i>. for his rash vow; the Kurus had expected an attack by <i>A.</i>; now they would protect Jayadratha (who had mentioned <i>A.'s</i>) encounter with Śiva, Hiraṇyapura, etc.); Karṇa, etc. (γ), would be in Jayadratha's van; Droṇa's array would be half a śakaṭa and half a lotus with a needle-mouthed array in the middle (VII, <b>75</b>). <i>A</i>. assured Kṛṣṇa of his competence to accomplish his vow, notwithstanding Droṇa, Sā., R., V., A., M., with Indra, V.-D., D., P., G., Garuḍa, etc., by means of the Gāṇḍīva and the weapons he had obtained from Yama, etc. (δ) (VII, <b>76</b>). The gods, including Indra, became very anxious. Sinister omens appeared in nature. Kṛṣṇa went to <i>A.'s</i> abode and consoled Subhadrā (mentioning the kṣattriya duties, etc., and revenge) (VII, <b>77</b>). Subhadrā bewailed Abhimanyu, and said “Shame on Bhīmasena, etc. (ε),” because they had not protected him. Draupadī and Uttarā came to her, lamenting. Kṛṣṇa said that Abhimanyu had attained the most laudable and enviable goal. Then he returned to <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>78</b>). <i>A</i>. performed his usual nightly sacrifice to Śiva. Kṛṣṇa with Dāruka repaired to his own tent. None in the Pāṇḍava camp slept that night, thinking of <i>A</i>. In the middle of the night Kṛṣṇa said to Dāruka that he had resolved to fight the next day [if necessary]; he must equip his chariot, placing Kaumodakī, etc., on it, making room for Garuḍa, and yoking Balāhaka, etc. (ζ), to it; when hearing Pāñcajanya emitting the shrill Ṛṣabha note, he should come to Kṛṣṇa (VII, <b>79</b>). <i>A</i>. saw Kṛṣṇa in a dream, who told him not to grieve, and mentioned the Pāśupata weapon (with which Śiva slew all the Daityas in battle); if he remembered it now, he would be able to slay Jayadratha next day; otherwise he must pray to Śiva. At the Brāhma hour <i>A</i>. saw himself sojourning through the sky (Himavat, Maṇimat, frequented by Si. and Cā., etc. (η)), with Kṛṣṇa, to where Śiva was seated with Pārvatī (description) (θ); Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. praised <is>Mahādeva</is> (VII, <b>80</b>). <i>A</i>. beheld the offerings that <is>Śiva</is> made every night to <is>Kṛṣṇa</is>, and he mentally adored both Kṛṣṇa and Śiva. Śiva told them to bring Śiva's bow and arrow from a lake of <is>amṛta</is>. In the lake they saw two terrible snakes; when they had uttered the <is>Brahma Śatarudriya</is>, the snakes assumed the forms of a bow and arrow; from Śiva's body there came out a <is>brahmacārin</is> with blue throat and red locks, and having showed <i>A</i>. the use of the bow and arrow and the mantras, he sped these weapons to that same lake. Having thus once more obtained the Pāśupata weapon, <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa came back to their own camp (VII, <b>81</b>).— § 597 (do.), VII, <b>82—84</b>: FOURTEENTH DAY: <b>83</b>, 2958, 2969, 2970; <b>84</b>, 2975, 2977, 2982, 2983, 2995, 2998: Yudhiṣṭhira underwent his <is>morning rites</is> (very copious description); Kṛṣṇa visited Yudhiṣṭhira (VII, <b>82</b>). Then also Virāṭa, etc. (α), arrived. Yudhiṣṭhira asked Kṛṣṇa to rescue the Pāṇḍavas, quoting Nārada. Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhiṣṭhira of Arjuna's success (VII, <b>83</b>). <i>A</i>. came and acquainted Yudhiṣṭhira with his dream, then he and Kṛṣṇa and Yuyudhāna (these two on one chariot) set out for <i>A.'s</i> pavilion. Kṛṣṇa equipped <i>A.'s</i> chariot (which had previously been sanctified with mantras), which <i>A</i>. circumambulated with his bow and arrow in hand. <i>A.</i>, Yuyudhāna, and Kṛṣṇa mounted the chariot. Many and auspicious omens appeared. <i>A</i>. charged Yuyudhāna to protect Yudhiṣṭhira in his absence (only he or Pradyumna was able to do it). Yuyudhāna proceeded to Yudhiṣṭhira (VII, <b>84</b>).—§ 598 (Jayadrathavadhap.), VII, <b>85—88: 85</b>, 3047, 3053, 3056; <b>86</b>, 3082; <b>87</b>, 3095: The warriors of Droṇa shouted in anger “where is <i>A.?</i>” etc. (η).

Śrutāyudha (<i>b</i>) attacked <i>A</i>. and was slain by Kṛṣṇa. Then <i>A</i>. slew Sudakṣina; all the troops fled away (VII, <b>92</b>). <i>A</i>. slew the Abhīṣāhas, etc. (γ), and slew Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus with the Aindra weapon, and then their sons Niyatāyus and Dīrghāyus. <i>A</i>. caused a great carnage among the Aṅgas (on elephants), the Kaliṅga king, etc. (on elephants), the Mlecchas, Yavanas, etc. (δ); <i>A</i>. slew the Ambastha king Śrutāyus (VII, <b>93</b>). Droṇa acknowledged his inability to oppose Arjuna, clad Duryodhana in invulnerable armour and urged him to oppose <i>A</i>. Duryodhana and the Trigartas, etc., proceeded towards the chariot of <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>94</b>). <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa steadily proceeded towards Jayadratha (description). <i>A</i>. slew Vinda and Anuvinda. While Kṛṣṇa led Arjuna's steeds, <i>A</i>. on foot kept the whole Kuru army in check, and piercing the earth with a weapon made a lake for his steeds to drink from and a hall of arrows for them to rest within; Nārada came to see the lake (VII, <b>99</b>). Si. and Cā., etc., applauded (VII, <b>100</b>). The progress of Arjuna (with Kṛṣṇa) became irresistible. Duryodhana (VII, <b>101</b>) fought with Arjuna (VII, <b>102</b>), who had also got the same invulnerable armour from Indra; <i>A</i>. shot terrible shafts consecrated with mantras at Duryodhana; this weapon could not be used again lest it should slay <i>A</i>. himself; <i>A</i>. deprived Duryodhana of his chariot, steeds, and weapons; when Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñcajanya and <i>A</i>. bent the Gāṇḍīva, the Kurus fell down on the ground. The protectors of Jayadratha attacked Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>103</b>). <i>A</i>. fought Bhūriśravas, etc. (μ), (and blew the Devadatta), Duryodhana, Aśvatthāman (VII, <b>104</b>), and slew many chariot-warriors. <i>A.'s</i> standard bore the sign of an ape with fierce face and tail like that of the lion (ν) (VII, <b>105</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira heard the blare of Pāñcajanya and thought <i>A</i>. to be in distress; he requested Sātyaki to go to <i>A</i>. and bring him intelligence of his safety; <i>A</i>. had said in the Dvaita wood to Yudhiṣṭhira, “even if Kṛṣṇa, etc. (σ), assists us, I shall yet appoint Sātyaki for our aid, since there is none equal to him,” and Yudhiṣṭhira had witnessed his reverence for <i>A</i>. at Dvārakā, after his return from the tīrthas, etc.; “the day is about to end”; Pradyumna and Sātyaki are equal to <i>A</i>. in bravery (VII, <b>110</b>). Sātyaki hesitated to comply with Yudhiṣṭhira's request on the ground of a counter-command by <i>A.</i>; “the Sauvīrakas, etc. (τ), D., As., men, Rā., K., M.-U., etc., cannot cope with <i>A</i>. in battle” (VII, <b>111</b>). Sātyaki agreed to obey Yudhiṣṭhira's order; “the distance from here is 3 yojanas”; he would crush the elephants of the Añjana breed mounted by Mlecchas (named Rukmarathas), who at Karṇa's command had returned from the pursuit of <i>A</i>. and were waiting for Sātyaki, and likewise crush those 700 elephants mounted by Kirātas (<i>c</i>) and formerly given by the Kirāta king to <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>112</b>). Yuyudhāna proceeded towards the chariot of <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>120</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira was anxious because he had not obtained any news of <i>A</i>. and Sātyaki, and thought of sending Bhīma after Sātyaki; Bhīma penetrated to Arjuna, making his presence known by a roar; <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa uttered loud roars in return; Yudhiṣṭhira understood that all was safe, and recalled <i>A.'s</i> feats (ππ) (VII, <b>128</b>). <i>A</i>. bent the Gāṇḍīva, and Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñcajanya (VII, <b>129</b>). Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas proceeded towards <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>130</b>). Bhīma was attacked by Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. became anxious for Bhīma (VII, <b>132</b>). Bhīma gladdened <i>A.</i>, etc. (ψψ) (VII, <b>136</b>). Bhīma's weapons being exhausted, he fled away from Karṇa and defended himself with the bodies of the elephants slain by <i>A.</i>; but, recollecting <i>A.'s</i> vow, he did not take the life of Karṇa; and Karṇa, recollecting his promise to Kuntī, did not take the life of Bhīma; <i>A</i>. then turned Karṇa and then Aśvatthāman to flight (VII, <b>139</b>). Sātyaki slew the steeds of Duḥśāsana, gladdening <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa (VII, <b>140</b>). Sātyaki approached <i>A.</i>, who was anxious for Yudhiṣṭhira (εεε) (VII, <b>141</b>). As Sātyaki succumbed to Bhūriśravas, <i>A.</i>, urged by Kṛṣṇa, cut off one of the arms of Bhūriśravas (VII, <b>142</b>). Bhūriśravas rebuked <i>A</i>. (ηηη); <i>A</i>. justified his conduct (θθθ). Bhūriśravas (<i>d</i>) desired to die in <is>prāya</is> (description); he acknowledged the justice of <i>A.'s</i> plea, and was blessed by Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. (ιιι). Though forbidden by Kṛṣṇa, etc. (κκκ), Sātyaki slew Bhūriśravas sitting in prāya (VII, <b>143</b>). <i>A</i>. proceeded to Jayadratha's chariot; Duryodhana, etc. (μμμ), encountered <i>A</i>. Duryodhana prevailed upon Karṇa to protect Jayadratha (ννν); <i>A</i>. deprived Karṇa of his steeds, chariot, and charioteer. <i>A</i>. invoked the Vāruṇa weapon and caused a great carnage (VII, <b>145</b>). <i>A</i>. employed the <is>Aindra</is> weapon, etc. (description). <i>A</i>. cut off Jayadratha's standard and slew his charioteer; Jayadratha was put into their centre by six chariot-warriors. Kṛṣṇa covered the sun by means of his yoga power, so that all, except <i>A.</i>, thought the sun to have set, and he urged <i>A</i>. to cut off Jayadratha's head without delay; <i>A</i>. caused such a carnage that the warriors abandoned Jayadratha in fear and fled away; Kṛṣṇa again urged <i>A</i>. to cut off Jayadratha's head without delay, telling him about the curse of Jayadratha's father <is>Vṛddhakṣattra</is> (<i>g</i>), who was still engaged in penances outside Samantapañcaka; therefore <i>A</i>. should make the head fall upon the lap of Vṛddhakṣattra himself, lest <i>A.'s</i> head should crack into 100 pieces; this <i>A</i>. did, and as the head fell down from Vṛddhakṣattra's lap the latter's head split into 100 pieces. Kṛṣṇa then withdrew the darkness he had created; Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. blew their conchs, etc.; <i>A</i>. fought with many mighty chariot-warriors (VII, <b>146</b>); Kṛpa (at whose death-like swoon <i>A</i>. grieved), Aśvatthāman (who fled), Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa told <i>A</i>. to avoid Karṇa, because the latter was still in possession of the lance that Indra had given him. “In this world there are only three mighty archers, Kṛṣṇa, <i>A.</i>, and Sātyaki,” said Sañjaya (VII, <b>147</b>). Bhīma tried to induce <i>A</i>. to permit him to slay Karṇa; <i>A</i>. vowed to slay Karṇa's son Vṛṣaseṇa in his presence. Kṛṣṇa congratulated <i>A</i>. (ϕϕϕ), who attributed the victory to Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to <i>A</i>. the results of that day's battle (VII, <b>148</b>). Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. congratulated Yudhiṣṭhira (ψψψ) (VII, <b>149</b>). A fierce battle ensued (VII, <b>152</b>).— § 600 (Ghaṭotkacavadhap.), VII, <b>153—183</b>: THE NIGHT COMBAT AFTER THE FOURTEENTH DAY: <b>159</b>, 7024, 7044, 7049, 7107; <b>164</b>, 7325, 7346, 7350; <b>165</b>, 7371; <b>167</b>, 7479, 7502, 7503, 7505, 7508; <b>170</b>, 7660, 7661; <b>171</b>, 7704, 7705, 7706, 7707, 7709; <b>172</b>, 7760; <b>181</b>, (8213); <b>182</b>, 8275; <b>183</b>, 8298: A dreadful battle took place between the Pāñcālas and the Kauravas (VII, <b>153</b>); <i>A.</i>, etc. (β), fought with Droṇa (VII, <b>154</b>); do.; Duryodhana urged Śakuni to proceed against <i>A</i>. together with Karṇa, etc. (κ) (VII, <b>156</b>).

Aśvatthāman, etc. (ββ), fought with <i>A</i>. in order to rescue Karṇa; <i>A</i>. slew the steeds and driver of Karṇa, etc.; Duryodhana fought with <i>A.</i>; Kṛpa urged Aśvatthāman to proceed against <i>A.</i>; he made Duryodhana desist from an encounter with <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>159</b>). <i>A</i>. slew the Yaudheyas, etc. (ζζ); the Pāñcālas fled, but were rallied by Bhīma and <i>A.</i>; the Kauravas fled (VII, <b>161</b>). Kṛṣṇa told Yudhiṣṭhira not to fight with Droṇa, he should go to Duryodhana, <i>A.</i>, and Bhīma (VII, <b>162</b>). Duryodhana commanded his troops to take up lighted lamps and torches (VII, <b>163</b>). “Karṇa will vanquish <i>A.</i>, etc.,” said Droṇa; <i>A</i>. fought against the Kauravas (VII, <b>164</b>). Alambuṣa fought with <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>165</b>). <i>A</i>. vanquished Alambuṣa and attacked Droṇa (VII, <b>167</b>). A new battle ensued (description) (VII, <b>169</b>); the Gāṇḍīva and the rattle of <i>A.'s</i> chariot were heard; Duryodhana despatched Śakuni against <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>170</b>). <i>A</i>. deprived Śakuni of his chariot, etc.; Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. blew their conchs (VII, <b>171</b>). The Pāṇḍava host fled; <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa rallied the retreating troops (σσ) (VII, <b>172</b>). Dhṛṣṭadyumna was deprived of his chariot by Karṇa, and ascended the chariot of <i>A. A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa and Yudhiṣṭhira conversed about Karṇa; <i>A</i>. asked Kṛṣṇa to proceed towards Karṇa. Kṛṣṇa said that none except <i>A</i>. and Ghaṭotkaca could encounter him; but <i>A</i>. must not do it as long as he retained the lance presented by Indra; “but Ghaṭotkaca will vanquish Karṇa.” They prevailed upon Ghaṭotkaca to encounter Karṇa (ττ) (VII, <b>173</b>). Ghaṭotkaca slew Alambuṣa and fought with Karṇa (VII, <b>174</b>). Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. to proceed in Bhīma's wake and resist Droṇa's division (VII, <b>177</b>). <i>A</i>. shot many Kṣattriyas (VII, <b>178</b>). Karṇa slew Ghaṭotkaca with his celestial dart (VII, <b>179</b>). Kṛṣṇa with transports of delight embraced <i>A.</i>, because Karṇa's dart could no more kill <i>A</i>. (VII, <b>180</b>). Kṛṣṇa's policy was the reason why Karṇa had never hurled the fatal dart at <i>A</i>.

The battle was revived (VII, <b>187</b>). D., G., Ṛ., Si., Aps., Y., and Rā. applauded Droṇa and <i>A.</i>, saying that “this is no human, etc. (μ), but an exalted Brāhma encounter”; both employed the Brāhma weapon; the engagement became general (VII, <b>188</b>). <i>A</i>. attacked the Kurus, and Droṇa attacked the Pāñcālas (VII, <b>189</b>). The Pāṇḍavas feared, thinking that <i>A</i>. would not fight with Droṇa. Kṛṣṇa told <i>A</i>. to abandon virtue and let some one tell Droṇa that Aśvatthāman had been slain in battle. <i>A</i>. did not approve; others approved, Yudhiṣṭhira, however, with great difficulty (VII, <b>190</b>). A fierce encounter took place between Droṇa and Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Sātyaki rescued Dhṛṣṭadyumna and was applauded by Kṛṣṇa, <i>A.</i>, and Si., etc. (VII, <b>191</b>). Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off Droṇa's head, though forbidden by <i>A</i>. and blamed by everybody (VII, <b>192</b>).—§ 603 (Nārāya— ṇāstram.), VII, <b>193—202</b>: THE LAST PART OF THE FIFTEENTH DAY: <b>193</b>, 8957, 8958; <b>195</b>, 9002; <b>196</b>, 9037, (9054); <b>197</b>, 9082, 9119, 9123, 9125; <b>198</b>, 9132; <b>199</b>, 9246, (9247); <b>200</b>, 9259, 9267, †9337; <b>201</b>, 9426, 9429, 9431, 9444, 9479; <b>202</b>, 9645: Aśvatthāman was filled with rage; he said there was none equal to him and <i>A</i>. in knowledge of arms; he had a weapon (the Nārāyaṇa weapon) that neither <i>A.</i>, etc. (δ), knew, presented by Nārāyaṇa to his father, with the promise that no man should ever be his equal in battle; only this weapon must never be used in haste, etc., and never be hurled upon persons that abandoned their chariots and weapons in battle, etc.; with this he would rout and slay the Pāṇḍavas, etc. (ι) (VII, <b>195</b>). Terrible signs appeared in nature. Yudhiṣṭhira spoke about the matter to <i>A</i>. (κ); <i>A</i>. in reply described the prowess of Aśvatthāman and the unrighteousness of the Pāṇḍavas in slaying Droṇa (λ); “all of us have passed the greater parts of our lives; the days that remain to us are few; this exceedingly unrighteous act has stained what is left;…I did not interfere, as he was about to be slain; for this fault I have already sunk into hell, overcome with shame” (VII, <b>196</b>). Bhīmasena, reproaching <i>A.</i>, vindicated the deed (μ) (VII, <b>197</b>). <i>A</i>. cast oblique glances upon Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Dhṛṣṭadyumna taunted Sātyaki for the slaughter of Bhūriśravas (ρ); Sātyaki would slay Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Dhṛṣṭadyumna asked Bhīma to let him slay Sātyaki (τ); then he and <i>A</i>. would slay the enemies. Kṛṣṇa and Yudhiṣṭhira restored peace (VII, <b>198</b>). Aśvatthāman invoked the Nārāyaṇa weapon (description). Kṛṣṇa prevailed upon the troops to lay down their weapons and alight from their chariots; Bhīmasena alone refused to do so. <i>A</i>. said that his vow was that the Gāṇḍīva should not be used against the Nārāyaṇa weapon, kine, and brahmans. Bhīma attacked Aśvatthāman, but was overwhelmed by the energy of the Nārāyaṇa weapon (VII, <b>199</b>). <i>A</i>. covered Bhīmasena with the Vāruṇa weapon; he and Kṛṣṇa forcibly brought Bhīma down from his chariot, making him abandon his weapons. Then the Nārāyaṇa weapon became pacified. It could not be used twice. <i>A.</i>, etc. (γγ), fought with Aśvatthāman (VII, <b>200</b>). <i>A</i>. addressed Aśvatthāman in harsh words (δδ), though <i>A</i>. and Aśvatthāman loved each other. Aśvatthāman became angry with <i>A</i>. and especially with Kṛṣṇa, touched water, and invoked the Āgneya weapon, the result being sinister omens and a great slaughter in the Pāṇḍava army; <i>A</i>. invoked the Brāhma weapon; the darkness was dispelled, etc., a full akṣauhiṇī of the Pāṇḍava troops had been felled; Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. were unwounded; Aśvatthāman lost heart and ran away; he met Vyāsa, who told him the history of Nārāyaṇa (<i>b</i>); “Nara and Nārāyaṇa are <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa” (VII, <b>201</b>). <i>A</i>. met with Vyāsa and inquired of him about the invisible person who aided him in the battle. Vyāsa said that it was Mahādeva himself, and related the tale of the sacrifice of Dakṣa, the destruction of Tripura (<i>d</i>), etc. —§ 604 (Karṇap.), VIII, <b>1—9</b>: THE NIGHT AFTER DROṆA'S DEATH, AND THE SIXTEENTH MORNING, AND BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH DAY: <b>3</b>, 72; <b>5</b>, 101, 143, 146; <b>9</b>, 267, 313: The Kurus made Karṇa their leader; he fought for two days and was then slain by <i>A</i>.

On the approach of the evening twilight the Kauravas retired to their encampment; they held a consultation in the night; Karṇa was installed as generalissimo (ι) (VIII, <b>10</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira asked <i>A</i>. to array the Pāṇḍava army and slay Karṇa. The Pāṇḍava army was arranged after the form of a half-moon, <i>A</i>. in the middle (ω); Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas became the protectors of <i>A.'s</i> chariot-wheels (VIII, <b>11</b>). <i>A</i>. fought with the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, <b>13, 16</b>) and Aśvatthāman (VIII, <b>16</b>). The Kaliṅga, Vaṅga, and Niṣāda heroes attacked <i>A</i>. with a division of elephants, which was broken; Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. not to spare Aśvatthāman, who was at last borne away by his steeds; Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. proceeded towards the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, <b>17</b>). Urged by Kṛṣṇa, <i>A</i>. slew the Magadha chief Daṇḍadhāra (lord of Girivraja), (on an elephant), and then his brother Daṇḍa; <i>A</i>. once more proceeded against the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, <b>18</b>), whom he slaughtered; <i>A</i>. slew Ugrāyudha's son; urged by Kṛṣṇa, <i>A</i>. defeated the remnant of the Saṃśaptakas in order not to lose any time in slaying Karṇa (VIII, <b>19</b>). Kṛṣṇa said to <i>A</i>. that he did not see Yudhiṣṭhira (VIII, <b>21</b>). <i>A</i>. fought the Trigartas, etc. (λλ), slew king Śatruñjaya, and Suśruta's son and Candradeva; king Satyasena wounded Kṛṣṇa and was slain by <i>A.</i>, who then slew Citravarman and Mitrasena, etc., and wounded Suśarman; all the Saṃśaptakas attacked <i>A.</i>, who invoked the Aindra weapon (description); the hostile army fled away almost entirely (VIII, <b>27</b>). Karṇa slaughtered the Pāñcālas, <i>A</i>. the Trigartas, etc., when the sun had passed the meridian (VIII, <b>28</b>). In the afternoon <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa (having said their daily prayers and worshipped Bhava) destroyed the Kurus; <i>A</i>. fought Duryodhana, Aśvatthāman, Karṇa. At the close of the day both armies withdrew; Rā. and Pś., etc., came (VIII, <b>30</b>). Dhṛtarāṣṭra exalted the prowess of <i>A</i>. (οο). Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would slay <i>A</i>. next day; at dawn he repeated his pledge: “<i>A</i>. is superior to me only by having Kṛṣṇa, the creator of the universe, for his charioteer, the chariot given him by Agni, his steed, and his standard with the ape.” He wanted Śalya (“who is superior to Kṛṣṇa”) as his charioteer (VIII, <b>31</b>).—§ 606 (do.), VIII, <b>35</b>, 1657: Duryodhana prevailed upon Śalya to be Karṇa's charioteer by relating how Brahmán had acted as such to Rudra, and by pointing to the fact that Kṛṣṇa had become the charioteer of <i>A.</i>, and would fight if <i>A</i>. were slain (VIII, <b>35</b>).—§ 607 (do.), VIII, <b>36—45: 36</b>, 1688; <b>37</b>, †1722, †1728, †1735, †1740, †1741, †1745; <b>38</b>, 1756, 1757, 1758, 1760, 1763, 1766, 1768, 1771, 1774; <b>39</b>, 1791, †1794, †1796, †1797, †1798, 1806; <b>40</b>, 1818, 1829; <b>41</b>, 1958, 1960, 1961; <b>42</b>, 1962; <b>45</b>, 2111: When the morning came, Duryodhana prevailed upon Śalya to become Karṇa's charioteer. Karṇa told Śalya to urge the steeds that he might slay <i>A.</i>, etc. (β) (VIII, <b>36</b>). Karṇa boasted (γ); Śalya ridiculed him and praised <i>A</i>. (δ). Karṇa proceeded on his chariot and inquired after <i>A</i>. (VIII, <b>37</b>), promising every Pāṇḍava soldier that he who pointed out to him <i>A</i>. would receive whatever wealth he desired (VIII, <b>38</b>). Śalya said that Karṇa would have a sight of <i>A</i>. without troubling to make a search, and asked him to abandon his desire for a single combat with <i>A</i>. (VIII, <b>39</b>). Karṇa said that Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. were well known to him but did not inspire him with fright; notwithstanding the curse of Paraśu-Rāma he would slay <i>A.</i>; he would employ the Brāhma weapon, which <i>A</i>. would never be able to escape, if only the wheels of Karṇa's chariot did not sink into the earth that day according to the brahman's curse whose homa-cow' calf he had inadvertently struck (VIII, <b>42</b>).—§ 608 (do.), VIII, <b>46—96</b>: THE SEVENTEENTH DAY'S BATTLE: <b>46</b>, 2130, 2132, 2152, 2154, 2161, 2177, 2193, 2197, 2199, 2201, 2206; <b>47</b>, 2212, 2217, 2219; <b>50</b>, 2415, 2421; <b>53</b>, 2574, 2598, 2604; <b>56</b>, 2774, 2784, 2801, 2810, 2828; <b>57</b>, 2849; <b>58</b>, 2857, 2858, 2894, 2898, 2903; <b>59</b>, 2955, 2966, 2970; <b>60</b>, 3039, 3055, 3063; <b>61</b>, 3079; <b>62</b>, 3142; <b>63</b>, 3198; <b>64</b>, 3217, 3219, 3223, 3230, 3231, 3240, 3241, 3272; <b>65</b>, †3292, †3293, †3294, 3307; <b>66</b>, 3309, 3317, 3335; <b>68</b>, 3386; <b>69</b>, (3440), (3470), 3483; <b>70</b>, 3492, 3515; <b>71</b>, 3562; <b>72</b>, 3605, 3615; <b>73</b>, 3634; <b>74</b>, 3791, 3803; <b>76</b>, 3842, 3859, 3860; <b>77</b>, 3861, 3862, 3874, 3875, 3876, 3878, 3879, 3881; <b>79</b>, 4004, 4025, 4032, 4037, 4066, 4067, 4068, 4072, 4075, 4085; <b>80</b>, 4118; <b>81</b>, 4124, 4145, 4146, 4157, 4159, 4161; <b>83</b>, 4257; <b>84</b>, 4301; <b>85</b>, 4329, 4340, 4347; <b>86</b>, 4349, (4364); <b>87</b>, 4383, 4408, 4409, 4415, 4416, 4421, 4423, 4425, 4429, 4430, 4437, 4461, 4462, 4476, 4479; <b>88</b>, 4505; <b>89</b>, 4524, 4532, 4533, 4534, 4535, 4536, 4539, 4559, 4591; <b>90</b>, 4623, 4625, 4626, 4632, 4633, 4635, 4658, 4662, 4664, 4667, 4670, 4671, 4672, 4675, 4685, 4688, 4690, 4696, 4698, 4701, 4715, 4718, 4720, 4725, 4731, 4736, 4741; <b>91</b>, 4766, 4780, 4807, 4811, 4816; <b>92</b>, 4819, 4826, 4829; <b>93</b>, 4834, 4851, 4867; <b>94</b>, 4905, 4919, 4947, 4956, 4960; <b>95</b>, 4977; <b>96</b>, 4990, 4992, 4997, 5008, 5016, 5027: Yudhiṣṭhira spoke to <i>A</i>. of the hostile array; <i>A</i>. should proceed against Karṇa, etc.; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa the chariot of <i>A.

How the Saṃśaptakas threatened to slay <i>A.</i>, etc.; Śalya dissuaded Kaṛna from trying to slay <i>A</i>. (VIII, <b>46</b>). <i>A</i>. arrayed his troops, headed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna (with steeds white like pigeons); by the side of Dhṛṣṭadyumna were the Draupadeyas. <i>A</i>. fought the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, <b>47</b>). <i>A</i>. fought the Saṃśaptakas, etc. (ηη); <i>A</i>. fought Suśarman; <i>A</i>. repeatedly invoked the Nāga weapon, paralyzing the legs (encircled with snakes) of the Saṃśaptakas; Suśarman invoked the Sauparṇa weapon; birds came down and devoured the snakes; <i>A</i>. sat down, recovered, and invoked the Aindra weapon; the battle became awful (VIII, <b>53</b>). <i>A</i>. fought the Saṃśaptakas; he addressed Kṛṣṇa upon beholding Karṇa's (<i>e</i>) prowess, and as the Saṃśaptakas were defeated (when the sun had ascended the meridian), <i>A</i>. pierced through the Kuru host. Duryodhana once more urged the Saṃśaptakas against him. Having slain 10,000 kṣattriyas, <i>A</i>. came to the further wing of the Saṃśaptakas, which was protected by the Kāmbojas; the younger brother of the Kāmboja chief Sudakṣiṇa was slain by <i>A.</i>; the Kāmbojas, etc. (ττ), were slain. <i>A</i>. fought Aśvatthāman; Si. and Cā. arrived; Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. not to spare Aśvatthāman, who swooned away and was borne away by his charioteer; <i>A</i>. slaughtered the Kuru troops, etc. (VIII, <b>56</b>). <i>A</i>. pointed out to Kṛṣṇa that the Pāṇḍava army was fleeing before Karṇa, and that Yudhiṣṭhira was nowhere to be seen; “the third part of the day still remains.” <i>A</i>. proceeded to Yudhiṣṭhira; Kṛṣṇa described the field of battle to <i>A</i>. (γγ). A terrible battle ensued (VIII, <b>58</b>). A remnant only of the Saṃśaptakas were left unslaughtered. Dhṛṣṭadyumna was worsted by Aśvatthāman and rescued by <i>A.; A</i>. proceeded towards the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, <b>59</b>). Kṛṣṇa pointed out to <i>A</i>. that Yudhiṣṭhira was being pursued by many Dhārtarāṣṭras and was in great danger; Karṇa would soon come against <i>A</i>. and was protected by Duryodhana; he should be slain. <i>A</i>. then destroyed the remnant of his foes; the Saṃśaptakas fled (VIII, <b>60</b>). <i>A</i>. fought against Aśvatthāman (VIII, <b>61</b>). <i>A</i>. appeared (VIII, <b>62</b>). Śalya exhorted Karṇa to fight with <i>A.</i>, but in vain; he once more reminded Karṇa of <i>A.</i>, etc. (ηη) (VIII, <b>63</b>). <i>A</i>. fought with Aśvatthāman; Aśvatthāman employed the Aindra weapon, which <i>A</i>. neutralized with a mighty weapon created by Indra; at last Aśvatthāman was borne away by his steeds. The Sṛñjayas called upon <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa. <i>A</i>. spoke to Kṛṣṇa about Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa asked him first to find Yudhiṣṭhira (VIII, <b>64</b>). <i>A</i>. met with Bhīma and asked him to bring intelligence of Yudhiṣṭhira; but they agreed that <i>A</i>. should go to Yudhiṣṭhira while Bhīma should resist the Saṃśaptakas. <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa found Yudhiṣṭhira lying on his bed (VIII, <b>65</b>). <i>A</i>. swore to slay Karṇa and all the foes that day (VIII, <b>67</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira censured <i>A.</i>, thinking that he had run away from the battle leaving Bhīma unsupported (λλλ), several times invoking him to give up the Gāṇḍīva to somebody else (VIII, <b>68</b>). <i>A</i>. drew his sword in order to strike off Yudhiṣṭhira's head in fulfilment of his vow regarding the person who would tell him to give up the Gāṇḍīva (μμμ); Kṛṣṇa addressed <i>A</i>. on the nature of truth (ννν); <i>A</i>. said he must keep his vow (ξξξ); Kṛṣṇa suggested that <i>A.</i>, by insulting Yudhiṣṭhira, by addressing him with “thou,” would be regarded as having slain him (οοο) (VIII, <b>69</b>). Urged by Kṛṣṇa, <i>A</i>. insulted Yudhiṣṭhira in a long speech (πππ); then he became despondent and desired to cut off his own head; Kṛṣṇa urged him to utter his own praises, as self-praise was equal to self-destruction. <i>A</i>. praised himself (ρρρ) and asked for Yudhiṣṭhira's forgiveness, promising to slay Karṇa and rescue Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa induced him to forgive both himself and <i>A</i>. (σσσ) (VIII, <b>70</b>). Speeches of Kṛṣṇa, <i>A.</i>, and Yudhiṣṭhira on the same topic (τττ) (VIII, <b>71</b>). <i>A</i>. proceeded to slay Karṇa, having obtained Yudhiṣṭhira's leave; Kṛṣṇa addressed <i>A</i>. in order to raise his spirits (υυυ) (VIII, <b>72</b>); continuation (υυυ) (VIII, <b>73</b>). <i>A.'s</i> cheerful reply to Kṛṣṇa (ψψψ) (VIII, <b>74</b>). Sañjaya related; <i>A</i>. slew many (VIII, <b>75</b>). Bhīma said to his charioteer Viśoka that he was anxious about <i>A</i>. and Yudhiṣṭhira; Viśoka pointed out to Bhīma that <i>A</i>. was returning to battle (ωωω) (VIII, <b>76</b>). <i>A</i>. and Bhīma attacked the Kaurava army (description) (VIII, <b>77</b>). <i>A</i>. produced a river of blood (description). Requested by <i>A</i>. (ζ), Kṛṣṇa brought him to Karṇa; Duryodhana attacked <i>A.; A</i>. vanquished Aśvatthāman, Kṛpa, and Kṛtavarman; Śikhaṇḍin, etc. (ιʹ), proceeding towards <i>A.</i>, checked the foes (VIII, <b>79</b>). <i>A.</i>, avoiding Karṇa, proceeded to the rescue of Bhīma; he informed Bhīma that Yudhiṣṭhira was well; he slew ten sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (VIII, <b>80</b>). <i>A</i>. was assailed by ninety Saṃśaptakas as he was proceeding towards Karna's chariot; he slew them; so also many Kauravas and a force of Mlecchas, mounted on 1,300 elephants under the command of Duryodhana. Bhīma rushed towards <i>A.</i>, and destroyed a small unslaughtered remnant of the Kauravas; then he followed <i>A</i>. in his rear (VIII, <b>81</b>). Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. to slay Karṇa; <i>A</i>. proceeded with Bhīmasena (VIII, <b>82</b>). Bhīmasena took up a little of Duḥśāsana's blood and drank it (μʹ), addressing Kṛṣṇa and <i>A.</i>, and vowing soon to slay Duryodhana (VIII, <b>83</b>). Urged by Bhīma and Nakula, <i>A</i>. proceeded towards Vṛṣasena (VIII, <b>84</b>). <i>A</i>. slew Karṇa's son Vṛṣasena, and threatened to slay Karṇa, as Bhīma would slay Duryodhana; <i>A</i>. attacked Karṇa (VIII, <b>85</b>); Kṛṣṇa addressed <i>A</i>. (τʹ); <i>A.'s</i> reply (υʹ) (VIII, <b>86</b>); description of <i>A</i>. and Karṇa (ϕʹ); As., Yātudhānas, Gh., etc., sided with Karṇa; the Vedas, etc. (χʹ), took the side of <i>A.</i>; the smaller snakes all sided with Karṇa; V., M., Sā., R., V.-D., A., and Agni, etc. (χʹ), sided with <i>A.</i>, while all Ā. sided with Karṇa; the Vaiśyas, etc. (ψʹ), sided with Karṇa; P., etc. (χʹ), with <i>A.</i>; the Pretas, Pś., Rā., etc., with Karṇa; D.-ṛ., B.-ṛ., R.-ṛ., with <i>A.</i>, as also G. headed by Tumburu. With the Prādheyas and Mauneyas, G., and Aps., and many wise sages, having wolves for their vehicles, came to witness the encounter that was also witnessed by D., Dā., G., N., Y., etc., M.-ṛ., P. (subsisting upon Svadhā), etc., and Brahmán with B.-ṛ., and Prajāpatis, and Bhava. Indra wished that <i>A</i>. should vanquish Karṇa; Sūrya, that Karṇa should vanquish <i>A.</i>; the gods urged Brahmán that the success of both should be equal, Indra that <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa should win; Brahmán and Īśāna (i.e. Śiva) said that the victory of <i>A</i>. was certain (ωʹ): “let Karṇa obtain identity with V. or M., let him be worshipped in heaven with Droṇa and Bhīṣma.” Indra acquiesced by their words. Description of Karṇa's and <i>A.'s</i> chariots; the ape on <i>A.'s</i> banner attacked the elephant's rope on Karṇa's banner. Kṛṣṇa and Śalya darted keen glances at each other, and so did <i>A</i>. and Karṇa. Śalya said that he would slay both Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>. if Karṇa was slain; Kṛṣṇa said that Karṇa could not slay <i>A.</i>; otherwise, the destruction of the universe would be at hand, and he would himself slay Karṇa and Śalya. <i>A</i>. said that that day the wives of Karṇa would become widows (ααʹ) (VIII, <b>87</b>). In the welkin D., N., As., Si., Y., G., Rā., Aps., and B.-ṛ., etc., looked on. The battle commenced. <i>A</i>. defeated Duryodhana, etc. (VIII, <b>88</b>); description of the battle between <i>A</i>. and Karṇa; <i>A</i>. employed an Āgneya weapon, which was neutralized by Karṇa with a Vāruṇa weapon by means of clouds, which was in its turn dispelled by <i>A</i>. by means of a Vāyavya weapon; <i>A</i>. employed the Aindra weapon (<i>? dayitaṃ deva-</i> <i>rājñaḥ; Mahendrasyāstraṃ</i>), Karṇa the Bhārgava weapon. Seeing <i>A.'s</i> weapons neutralized by Karṇa, Bhīma (αεʹ) and Kṛṣṇa (αζʹ) urged <i>A</i>. to put forth his strength. <i>A</i>. bowed to Brahmán and invoked the Brāhma weapon, which could be applied by the mind alone; Karṇa neutralized it; urged by Bhīma, <i>A</i>. applied a second Brāhma weapon, which caused a great carnage among the Kaurava troops (description). <i>A</i>. shot at Karṇa and Śalya and slew Sabhāpati, etc. The Kauravas urged Karṇa to slay <i>A</i>. Yudhiṣṭhira appeared in order to witness the encounter. <i>A.'s</i> bowstring burst; Karṇa pierced <i>A</i>. (αδʹ). Karṇa employed five snakes as arrows; they were cut off by <i>A.</i>, who slew 2,000 Kurus. The Kurus fled, leaving Karṇa to fight alone with <i>A</i>. (VIII, <b>89</b>). The snake Aśvasena entered into Karṇa's quiver in the form of an arrow. Karṇa and <i>A</i>. were fanned and sprinkled with fragrant sandal-water by many Aps., staying in the welkin, and Śakra and Sūrya gently brushed their faces with their hands. Karṇa aimed that arrow which he had long kept for <i>A.'s</i> destruction. Omens appeared; Karṇa did not know that Aśvasena had entered his arrow. Kṛṣṇa with his feet pressed <i>A.'s</i> car about a cubit into the earth and the snakearrow only broke his diadem (made by Svayambhū for Indra > <i>A</i>.); incapable of being crushed by Rudra, etc. (αιʹ). Karṇa would not shoot the same weapon again. Aśvasena then of his own accord came towards <i>A</i>. in the shape of an arrow; Kṛṣṇa informed <i>A.; A</i>. cut off the snake, and Kṛṣṇa raised the chariot from the earth. Once, when Karṇa was stupefied, <i>A</i>. did not wish to slay him, but he was taught by Kṛṣṇa never to spare an enemy. Karṇa invoked the Brāhma weapon and <i>A</i>. the Aindra weapon, which was neutralized by Karṇa; urged by Kṛṣṇa to shoot “high weapons,” <i>A</i>. shot the Brāhma weapon. Karṇa cut off eleven bowstrings of <i>A.'s</i> one after another, not knowing that <i>A</i>. had 100 strings to his bow; urged by Kṛṣṇa to strike Karṇa with “superior weapons,” <i>A</i>. then consecrated another celestial weapon with mantras, uniting the Raudra weapon with it. At that time the earth swallowed up Karṇa's wheels. Karṇa asked <i>A</i>. to wait for a moment till he had raised his sunken wheel (VIII, <b>90</b>). Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. to pierce Karṇa with a celestial weapon; <i>A</i>. kindled with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate from all the pores of his body. Both Karṇa and <i>A</i>. invoked the Brāhma weapon; <i>A</i>. shot an Agni weapon, which was neutralized by Karṇa with the Vāruṇa weapon, spreading darkness in all directions, which <i>A</i>. dispelled with the Vāyavya weapon. Pierced by a shaft of Karṇa's, <i>A</i>. began to reel, etc.; Karṇa in vain endeavoured to extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses, <i>A</i>. took up an Añjalika weapon. Urged by Kṛṣṇa, <i>A</i>. cut off Karṇa's standard, and then struck off Karṇa's head with an Añjalika weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out “Peace be to the universe!”) (VIII, <b>91</b>). <i>A</i>. fought the chariots of the Kauravas. <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa blew their conchs; D., G., men, Cā., M.-ṛ., Y., and M.-U. congratulated <i>A</i>. (VIII, <b>94</b>). Urged by Kṛṣṇa (αϕʹ), <i>A</i>. presented himself to Yudhiṣṭhira, who greeted <i>A</i>. and Kṛṣṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira, with Kṛṣṇa and <i>A.</i>, came back to the field to have a look at Karṇa's body (VIII, <b>96</b>).—§ 609 (Śalyap.), IX, <b>1—2: 2</b>, 119: Śalya was made the commander of the army (IX, <b>1</b>).

Duryodhana fought with <i>A</i>. (IX, <b>11</b>). <i>A</i>. fought with Aśvatthāman (IX, <b>12</b>). <i>A</i>. fought against Aśvatthāman and the Trigartas; he destroyed 2,000 cars (IX, <b>14</b>). The Pāṇḍavas (in the very sight of Kṛṣṇa and <i>A</i>.) were afflicted by the Kurus; <i>A</i>. fought with Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman. Yudhiṣṭhira said that <i>A</i>. should protect his rear; <i>A</i>. began to slay the Kaurava troops (IX, <b>16</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira slew Śalya with a celestial dart (IX, <b>17</b>). <i>A.</i>, etc. (ββ), began to slaughter the Madrakas (IX, <b>18</b>). Also the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra almost all turned away from the fight at midday; <i>A</i>. fought against the chariots; Duryodhana rallied a small force by a spirited address (ζζ); the Pāṇḍavas, and especially <i>A.</i>, rushed against them (IX, <b>19</b>). The whole army of Duryodhana fled except Duryodhana (IX, <b>21</b>). <i>A</i>. (desiring to exterminate the Kurus) addressed Kṛṣṇa, recounting the loss sustained by the Kurus (νν), and attacked the remnant of the Kuru army, and caused a great slaughter (IX, <b>24</b>). <i>A</i>. and Bhīma, etc. (οο), slew 3,000 elephants, encompassing the Pāṇḍava brothers; <i>A</i>. had afflicted Sañjaya's men; Bhīma and <i>A</i>. destroyed the elephants (IX, <b>25</b>). Kṛṣṇa urged <i>A</i>. to destroy the remnant of Duryodhana's troops (σσ); <i>A</i>. ascended his chariot (ττ); <i>A</i>. fought against Suśarman and Śakuni, the Trigartas, slew Satyakarman, Satyeṣu, and the Prasthala ruler Suśarman, and the latter's thirty-five sons, etc., and then proceeded against the remnant of the Bharata host (IX, <b>27</b>).—§ 612 (Hradapr.), IX, <b>29—31: 29</b>, 1568, 1600; <b>30</b>, 1725: the followers of Śakuni attacked the Pāṇḍavas; <i>A</i>. and Bhīmasena came to the rescue of Sahadeva; <i>A</i>. slew them. Duryodhana abandoned his slain steed, and fled away without a companion, on foot towards a lake, taking up his mace. The Pāṇḍavas with <i>A</i>. baffled the purpose of the Kurus. In Duryodhana's army no great chariot-warrior was alive save Aśvatthāman, Kṛpa, and Kṛtavarman (IX, <b>29</b>). When the sun had set, <i>A.</i>, etc. (ε), started towards the lake (IX, <b>30</b>).

Kṛṣṇa caused <i>A</i>. to take down the Gāṇḍīva and his inexhaustible quivers, and then to dismount; then Kṛṣṇa also dismounted; the celestial Ape on his standard disappeared, and the chariot (burnt by Droṇa and Karṇa with the Brāhma weapon) with its steeds, etc., was reduced to ashes. At Kṛṣṇa's suggestion the Pāṇḍavas and Sātyaki resolved to pass the night at a spot outside the camp, on the banks of the Oghavatī.

When <i>A</i>. had caused Vasudeva and his four wives to be burnt, he visited the place where the Vṛṣṇis had been slaughtered, and caused the last rites to be performed and Rāma and Kṛṣṇa to be burnt. On the seventh day he set out with the ladies and children, the Yādava troops and other inhabitants, with Kṛṣṇa's 16,000 wives, and Vajra; they numbered many millions in all; then the ocean flooded Dvārakā; they proceeded in slow marches; at Pañcanada the Ābhīras (Mlecchas) conspired to rob the cavalcade. <i>A</i>. only with great difficulty succeeded in stringing his bow. His celestial weapons would not come to his mind; the women were snatched away by the robbers; <i>A.'s</i> shafts soon became exhausted; formerly they had been inexhaustible. <i>A</i>. became very distressed; he escorted the remnant of the cavalcade to Kurukṣetra; he established the son of Kṛtavarman in the city of Mārttikāvata with the remnant of the women of the Bhoja king; the remainder, with children and old men and women, at Indraprastha with Vajra for their ruler; the son of Yuyudhāna (with old men, etc.) on the banks of the Sarasvatī, etc.; then <i>A</i>. entered the retreat of Vyāsa. <b>8</b>, 254, 255, (261): <i>A</i>. informed Vyāsa of what had passed (ν) (“500,000 warriors have thus been laid down”). Vyāsa said that Kṛṣṇa, as also the Pāṇḍavas, had finished their work; “the time has come for your departure from this world,” etc. (ξ). <i>A</i>. entered Hāstinapura and informed Yudhiṣṭhira of what had taken place.—§ 794 (Mahāprasthān.), XVII, <b>1</b>, 2, 5, 20, 31, 37, 38: The Pāṇḍavas set their heart on leaving the world; the kingdom was made over to Yuyutsu, and Parikṣit installed as king in Hāstinapura, while Vajra ruled in Indraprastha. Kṛpa was installed as the preceptor of Parikṣit. The subjects tried in vain to dissuade them; they and Draupadī divested themselves of their ornaments and dressed in the barks of trees; then they threw their sacred fires into the water. Then they set out on their journey: the five Pāṇḍavas, Draupadī, and a dog; wandering towards the east they reached the sea of red water. Agni came (α) and caused <i>A</i>. to throw the Gāṇḍīva and his inexhaustible quiver into the water and thus restore them to Varuṇa.

He fought, Kṛṣṇa serving as charioteer.<sup>10</sup> Victory due to Kṛṣṇa.<sup>11</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Heard of Abhimanyu's death and vowed to kill Jayadratha the following day, which he did.<sup>12</sup> Was taken by Kṛṣṇa to Kailāsa where Śiva blessed him. Took part in the <i>svayamvaram</i> of Lakṣmaṇā. His arrow touched the fish target but did not hit it.<sup>13</sup> In the course of his pilgrimage he heard at Prabhāsa that his uncle's daughter Subhadrā was being proposed by Balarāma to Duryodhana. He wished to marry her, and with this object spent four months in Dvāraka as <i>Tridaṇḍī</i> ascetic. At this time Rāma invited him one day for <i>bhikṣā.</i> When he and Subhadrā met, both exchanged their love by their eyes. On a day of festive occasion Subhadrā came out, when Arjuna carried her off in a chariot with the approval of Kṛṣṇa. Rāma protested but Kṛṣṇa pacified him. Finally Rāma sent presents to his sister.<sup>14</sup> On a visit to Syamantapañcaka.<sup>15</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Once a Brāhmaṇa of Dvāraka preferred a complaint during Kṛṣṇa's <i>aśvamedha</i> that his children died immediately after their birth. Arjuna offered to recover them for him, though Kṛṣṇa had his own doubt. Accompanying the Brāhmaṇa, Arjuna guarded the delivery room. The child was born and soon died. At this Arjuna went to Indra's place, and Yama's, and to the abodes of all gods, with the resolution to fall in a fire in case he did not rescue the child. Unable to recover it, Arjuna was about to plunge into the flames when Kṛṣṇa prevented him. He was taken to the abode of Nārāyaṇa and all the children were recovered. Returned to Dvārakā to attend Kṛṣṇa's <i>aśvame-</i> <i>dha,</i> after bringing joy to the Brāhmaṇa.<sup>16</sup> Other exploits of Arjuna were defeating Indra at Khāṇḍava, pleasing Śiva in Kirāta's disguise, and vanquishing Nivātakavacas.<sup>17</sup> Went once to Heaven to please Indra, when he slew singlehanded 60,000 <i>dānavas</i> who obstructed <i>yajñas.</i><sup>18</sup> Went to Dvārakā to see his relations. Was advised to take Yādavas to Indraprastha as Dvārakā was about to be swallowed by the sea. Performed the last rites to the dead in Dvārakā, and took the remainder to his place. Was defeated by robbers and Ābhiras after the departure of Kṛṣṇa to Heaven. Informed Yudhiṣṭhira of Kṛṣṇa's departure to Heaven and of his great sorrow, and also of the almost end of the Yādava stock. Crowned Vajra king.<sup>19</sup> Arjuna knew and realised the <i>māyā</i> of <i>Hari.</i><sup>20</sup> Observed the <i>Ādityaśayanam</i> vow. Visited the Vāmana temple at Kurukṣetra during his <i>tīrtha-</i> <i>yātrā</i> and asked Śaunaka to narrate the circumstances of that <i>Avatār</i> after Vārāha.<sup>21</sup> Was asked by Vyāsa to perform penance expelling death.<sup>22</sup> Put down the prowess of Kārtavīrya by the curse of Āpava.<sup>23</sup> Known as Pārtha, Dhanamjaya, Jiṣṇu. <F>1) Bhā.
