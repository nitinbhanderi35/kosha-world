Gaṅgā brought down by Bhagīratha to the earth first fell on Śiva's head and thence on Bindusaras, and therefrom flowed in seven tributaries. Three tributaries, Hlādinī, Pāvanī and Nalinī flowed eastwards, Sucakṣus, Sītā and Sindhu westwards, and the seventh tributary followed Bhagīratha. The mortal remains of the sons of Sagara were flooded with its waters, and their souls attained heaven."
