Questioned by Janamejaya why Agni desired to consume the forest of Khāṇḍava, Vaiśampāyana related: It has been heard in the <is>Purāṇa</is> that King <is>Śvetaki</is> performed sacrifices so incessantly that his ṛtvijes left him, their eyes being afflicted with the continued smoke; he then had his sacrifice completed by other ṛtvijes. He then desired to perform another sacrifice, which should extend over 100 years. But he could not obtain any priests to assist him; they told him to apply to <is>Rudra</is>. He then went to <is>Kailāsa</is>, and by observing the most rigid austerities he prevailed upon Rudra that his sacrifice should be completed, on the condition that he could for twelve years without intermission pour libations of clarified butter into the fire, himself leading all the while the life of a brahmacārin. When this had been done Rudra said that he would not himself assist at the sacrifice, which properly belonged to the brahmans; but he caused <is>Durvāsas</is> (<i>b</i>) to complete it. [When the time came Śvetaki ascended to heaven (Svarga) with the ṛtvijes and sadasyas who had helped him in life, B.] But <is>Agni</is> became sick, because he had drunk clarified butter for twelve years, and applied to <is>Brahmán</is>. Brahmán told him to consume the forest of <is>Khāṇḍava</is>, that abode of the enemies of the gods, which he had of old once burnt to ashes at the request of the gods, together with its living population; then he would regain his own nature. Seven times Agni, assisted by <is>Vāyu</is>, set the forest on fire; but the inhabitants extinguished the fire (the elephants bringing water in their trunks, and the Nāgas in their hoods, etc.) (I, <b>223</b>).—§ 256<i>a</i>: I, <b>224</b>, 8157—8165<i>a</i>. Agni again applied to Brahmán, who told him to solicit the old deities <is>Nara</is> and <is>Nārāyaṇa</is> (now <is>Arjuna</is> and <is>Kṛṣṇa</is> to aid him."
