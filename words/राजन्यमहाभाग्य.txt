After the sacrifice was completed, these four took <i>Nārada</i> on their chariot and asked him who of them (as they were all blessed with long life and virtuous) should first fall from Heaven? <i>Nārada</i> answered that <i>Aṣṭaka</i> should first come down, because he had praised himself for having given away thousands of kine; then <i>Pratardana</i>, because he, though he had given to <i>brahmans</i> successively the four horses yoked to his chariot, and then had drawn the chariot himself, had done so with detraction (<i>asūyati</i>); then <i>Vasumanas</i>, because he, though he had twice at the <i>svastivācana</i> for the sake of a flowery chariot (<i>puṣparathasya</i>, v. 13313, see the note of PCR., p. 601) given the chariot to <i>Nārada</i>, because he praised it, had not done so on a third occasion; <i>Nārada</i> himself would come down before <i>Śibi</i>, because <i>Śibi</i>, at the request of <i>Vidhātṛ</i> in the disguise of a <i>brahman</i>, who was desirous of trying <i>Śibi</i>, had cooked his son <i>Bṛhadgarbha</i> as food for the <i>brahman</i> without being angry, though the <i>brahman</i> meanwhile had set fire to <i>Śibi's</i> abode and treasury and arsenal, and when the <i>brahman</i> ordered <i>Śibi</i> himself to eat his son's body <i>Śibi</i> was willing to do it; but the <i>brahman</i> said, “Thou hast conquered wrath, there is nothing that thou canst not give to the <i>brahmans</i>,” and withdrew his hand, and then <i>Śibi</i> beheld his son like a child of the gods, while the <i>brahman</i> disappeared; and that <i>Śibi</i> had not done this for fame or wealth, etc., but because this is not practised by the sinful (III, <b>198</b>)."
