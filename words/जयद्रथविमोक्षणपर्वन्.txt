Draupadīhar.): <i>Bhīma</i> seized <i>Jayadratha</i> by the hair, and holding him high up in the air thrust him on the ground, etc., and regretted that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had forbidden to kill him. He then with his arrow shaved <i>Jayadratha's</i> head, leaving only five tufts of hair, and made him promise to say in public assemblies, “I am the slave of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>.” They then bound him and thrust him into the chariot; then they drove towards the hermitage and presented him to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Draupadī</i> set him free with his army. § 524: <i>Jayadratha</i> went to <i>Gaṅgādvāra</i>, and pleased <i>Śiva</i> so that he deigned to accept his offerings in person and granted him a boon. <i>Jayadratha</i> asked that he might be able to defeat in battle all the five <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> on their chariots. This <i>Śiva</i> declared to be impossible, as <i>Arjuna (b</i>) was invincible, and was protected by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who was <i>Viṣṇu (c). Śiva</i> then briefly reminded <i>Jayadratha</i> of four incarnations of <i>Viṣṇu (d</i>). “Thou shalt, however, be able to vanquish for a single day only the rest of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> forces and the four <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, but not <i>Arjuna</i>.” Then <i>Śiva</i> vanished with <i>Umā, Jayadratha</i> returned home, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> continued to dwell in <i>Kāmyaka</i> (III, <b>272</b>)."
