            "content": "[<b>Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda(ḥ)</b>]¦ (“the discourse between Bali and Indra”). (<i>a</i>) § 671<i>b</i> (Mokṣadh.): One day, after having subjugated all As., <i>Indra</i> asked <i>Brahmán</i> where <i>Bali</i> now was, he who was <i>Vāyu</i>, etc. (α). <i>Brahmán</i> said that <i>Bali</i> might now have taken his birth among camels or bulls, etc., and be staying in a deserted house; he told <i>Indra</i> not to slay him, but to ask him for instruction in morality. <i>Indra</i> roamed over the earth on <i>Airāvata</i>, and found <i>Bali</i> in a deserted house in the form of an ass. <i>Indra</i> scoffed at him, and asked if he did not grieve, and where his 42,000 <i>Gandharvas</i> had gone who in former days used to dance before him, and also about the garland given to him by <i>Brahmán. Bali</i> said: “When thou becomest like me, thou wilt not indulge in speech like this” (XII, <b>223</b>). <i>Bali</i> said that D., men, P., G., snakes, and Rā. were under his sway in days gone by, and that all creatures used to flatter him; but he did not grieve at all; in reality it is Time that creates and destroys all things, though living creatures brag of doing this or that; “this royal glory (<i>rājya-śrī</i>) …does not dwell long in one place; she had dwelt in thousands of <i>Indras</i> before thee, who were very much superior to thee;…knowing thee to be full of vanity, she will very soon desert thee” (XII, <b>224</b>). <i>Indra</i> saw <i>Śrī</i>, adorned with head-plumes, etc., issue out of <i>Bali</i>, who did not know whether she was an As. damsel or a celestial one or a human one; <i>Indra</i> asked her who she was, as she stood there like <i>Māyā</i> herself; she said: “<i>Virocana</i> did not know me; <i>Bali</i> does not know me; the learned called me <i>Duḥsahā</i>. (‘difficult to be borne’), etc. (β); thou knowest me not, O <i>Indra</i>, nor does any one of the deities know me; nor the Creator (<i>Dhātā</i>), nor the Ordainer (<i>Vidhātā</i>) rules over me; it is <i>Time</i> that moves me from one place to another; do not disregard <i>Bali. Bali</i> has fallen off from truth, etc.; formerly he was devoted to the <i>brahmans</i>, etc.; but latterly he began to cherish feelings of animosity towards the <i>brahmans</i> and touched clarified butter with soiled hands; therefore I desert him and shall henceforth dwell in thee; there is none among D., G., As., or Rā. that can keep me for ever.” Requested by <i>Indra</i>, she told him how she might be able to reside in him permanently, dividing herself into four parts, according to the ordinance laid down in the <i>Vedas</i>: one to be established on earth, one in the waters, one in Fire, one among the good, while <i>Indra</i> should continue to protect her. <i>Bali</i> said that when the Sun would shine only upon the region of <i>Brahmán</i> in the middle of <i>Sumeru</i>, then a great battle between the gods and the <i>Asuras</i> would again occur, and in that fight <i>Bali</i> would certainly vanquish them all. <i>Indra</i> said that <i>Brahmán</i> had commanded him never to kill him; “never will come the day when the Sun will shine only from the meridian (<i>madhyataḥ sthitaḥ); Brahmán</i> has before this laid down the laws that regulate the Sun's motions…” <i>Bali</i> proceeded towards the South; <i>Indra</i> proceeded towards the North and ascended the skies (XII, <b>225</b>).—(<i>b</i>) § 673<i>b</i> (Mokṣadh.): <i>Bhīṣma</i> said: After the battle between the gods and the <i>Asuras</i>, in which a large number of Dai. and Dā. fell, <i>Bali</i> became king. He was deceived by <i>Viṣṇu</i>, who once more established his sway over all the worlds. <i>Indra</i> was once more invested with the sovereignty of the gods, etc.; the three worlds once more swelled with prosperity, and <i>Brahmán</i> became glad of heart. At that time <i>Indra</i>, accompanied by R., V., Ā., A., D.-ṛ., G., Si., etc., seated on the four-tusked <i>Airāvata</i>, made a progress through all the worlds. Once he saw <i>Bali Vairocani</i> within a certain mountain cave on the sea-shore. <i>Bali</i> showed no signs of sorrow or agitation. <i>Indra</i> asked him how it was that he was so unmoved; “thou art bound with <i>Varuṇa's</i> noose and hast been struck with my thunderbolt.” <i>Bali</i> said: “What I am now, thou wilt be in the future,” explaining that only time (not merit) rules the destiny of men; “that thou regardest thyself as the actor is the root of all sorrow”; “in the course of time many thousands of <i>Indras</i> and of deities have been swept away <i>yuga</i> after <i>yuga</i>, and will be swept away in future…, just as <i>Pṛthu</i>, etc. (α),” though they were devoted to the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Vedio</i> rites, etc., and though all of them were the offspring of <i>Dakṣa's</i> daughters; “those 1,000 [celestial years], that are the measure of thy sway, will surely come to an end”; “Ā., R., Sā., V., and M. were all vanquished by me,” etc. <i>Indra's</i> panegyric on <i>Bali. Indra</i> left the spot and was praised by the M.-ṛ.; <i>Fire</i> once more began to bear the libations [to the gods], etc. (XII, <b>227</b>)."
