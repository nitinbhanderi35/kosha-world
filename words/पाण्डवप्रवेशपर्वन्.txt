Then he asked <i>Arjuna</i> to select some spot where they might dwell undiscovered. <i>Arjuna</i> mentioned some countries surrounding the kingdom of the <i>Kurus</i> (α). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> chose the city of king <i>Virāṭa</i>, who was attached to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> would introduce himself as a brahman named <i>Kaṅka</i>, who was skilled in dice and had been the friend of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (IV, <b>1</b>). <i>Bhīmasena</i> as a cook and wrestler named <i>Vallava</i>, who had served <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna (b-e</i>) as a hermaphrodite, <i>Bṛhannalā</i> by name, who had served <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> as a waiting-maid (IV, <b>2</b>). <i>Nakula</i> as a keeper of horses, named <i>Granthika</i>, who had formerly been employed by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Sahadeva</i> as a cowherd, named <i>Tantripāla</i>; <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> would serve <i>Sudeṣṇā</i> (the queen of <i>Virāṭa</i>) as a <i>sairindhrī</i>, skilled in dressing hair, who had waited upon <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (IV, <b>3</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> said: “Let our priest, with our charioteers and cooks, repair to the abode of <i>Drupaḍa</i> and there maintain our <i>agnihotra</i> fires, and <i>Indrasena</i>, etc., with the empty chariots proceed to <i>Dvāravatī</i>, and the maidservants go to the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, together with the charioteers and the cooks. Let all of them say that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had left them at the <i>Dvaitavana</i> lake.” <i>Dhaumya</i> advised the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> as to how they should behave at court and performed the rites ordained in respect of departure, and then set out for the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, taking with him their sacred fires; <i>Indrasena</i>, etc., proceeded to the <i>Yādavas</i> (IV, <b>4</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> then proceeded in the direction of the southern bank of the river <i>Kālindī</i> and passed through the countries of the <i>Yakṛllomas</i> and the <i>Śūrasenas</i>, leaving behind on the right the country of the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and on the left that of the <i>Daśārṇas. Arjuna</i> carried <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>. When they had reached the capital of <i>Virāṭa, Arjuna</i>, as <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> was known to all men, caused them to stow away their weapons in a <i>śamī-</i>tree near a cemetery. Nakula ascended the tree and tied the weapons fast. In the tree they hung up a corpse and said to the inquirers: “This is our mother, aged 180 years.” They kept for themselves the names <i>Jaya</i>, <i>jayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, Jayadbala</i> (IV, <b>5</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> praised <i>Durgā (f</i>), who then showed herself to him and promised him victory, etc. (IV, <b>6</b>). They then entered the city and were successively received by <i>Virāṭa. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (naming himself <i>Kaṅka Vaiyāghrapadya</i>) was accepted as a courtier (IV, <b>7</b>). <i>Bhīmasena</i> (naming himself <i>Vallava</i>) was accepted as a cook and a wrestler (IV, <b>8</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> was seen by the queen <i>Sudeṣṇā Kaikeyī</i> and accepted as a <i>sairindhrī</i>; she said: “My five husbands, who are <i>Gandharvas</i> and sons of a <i>Gandharva</i> king, always protect me” (IV, <b>9</b>). <i>Sahadeva</i> came clad in a cowherd's dress and speaking the dialect of cowherds, and said that he was a <i>vaiśya</i> named <i>Ariṣṭanemi</i>. He was accepted as the king's head cowherd (IV, <b>10</b>). Then <i>Arjuna</i> appeared dressed as an eunuch and naming himself <i>Bṛhannalā</i>, and was accepted as a dancing master (IV, <b>11</b>). <i>Nakula</i>, who named himself <i>Granthika</i>, likewise was accepted as the king's head horsekeeper (IV, <b>12</b>)."
