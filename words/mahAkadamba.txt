These rivers fall on the top of Supārśva mountain and flow through the western side of Ilāvṛta. The region around this place to a distance of a hundred yojanas is filled with the fragrant air breathed out by the gods who feed upon the essence of the waters in these rivers. The Devī who lives in this sacred place is called “Dhāreśvarī”. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha)."
