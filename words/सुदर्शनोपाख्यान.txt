Duryodhana</i> begat the beautiful <i>Sudarśanā</i> upon the river <i>Narmadā</i>; <i>Agni</i>, taking the shape of a brahman, demanded her hand from the king, who would not give her to him; then <i>Agni</i> vanished from his great sacrifice. <i>Duryodhana</i> repaired to the brahmans, who became informed of the matter by <i>Agni</i>; then the king consented, and <i>Agni</i> gave, as a marriagedower, the boon to the king that he would always remain there, and <i>Agni</i> has always been present there to this day, and was seen by <i>Sahadeva</i> on his digvijaya. She bore to <i>Agni</i> the beautiful <i>Sudarśana</i>, who, even in his childhood, knew <i>Bráhman. Sudarśana</i> married <i>Oghavatī</i>, the daughter of king <i>Oghavat</i> and the sister of <i>Ogharatha</i>, and dwelt in <i>Kurukṣetra</i>; he took the vow of conquering death by leading the life of a householder. He instructed <i>Oghavatī</i> that, for pleasing a guest, she must not spare even her own person. One day, when <i>Sudarśana</i> went out to fetch firewood, a graceful brahman came to <i>Oghavatī</i> and required and obtained her own person. <i>Mṛtyu</i>, with his iron club, was always at the side of <i>Sudarśana</i>, watching him in order to find out his flaws. When <i>Sudarśana</i> came home he showed no anger. The brahman turned out to be <i>Dharma</i>, who was pleased with <i>Sudarśana</i>, and said: “you have conquered <i>Mṛtyu</i>”; <i>Oghavatī</i> has been protected from defilement by your virtue and by her own chastity; you will attain to all the worlds in this your body, and, as <i>yoga</i> is in the control of <i>Oghavatī</i>, she will follow you with half her corporeal self, being with the other half [the river] <i>Oghavatī</i>. Then <i>Indra</i> came, riding in a fine chariot, and approached that brahman."
