A jackal, black as a raven, rebuked them for not waiting till the sun had set, as the child might possibly revive. The vulture and the jackal alternately endeavoured to persuade them. The jackal mentioned that by <i>Rāma's</i> [i.e. <i>Dāśarathi's</i>] slaying the <i>Śūdra</i> named <i>Śambuka</i>, a <i>brahmaṇa</i> child was restored to life; similarly the son of R.-ṛ. <i>Śveta</i>. The vulture said that if only <i>Rudra</i>, etc. (α), would grant him a boon, the child might come back to life, and mentioned the spirits and Y. and Rā., etc., who haunt the burning-place, while the jackal reminded them that it was here on this “quiet and peaceful” spot that the <i>Pitṛs</i> by thousands took leave of the world. The jackal and the vulture continued to dispute, exhausted with hunger and thirst, wishing to get opportunity of devouring the child. Then <i>Śaṅkara</i> (i.e. <i>Śiva</i>) exhorted by his consort came, and, taking up a quantity of water in his hands, restored the child to life for a hundred years, and to the jackal and the vulture he granted a boon, in consequence of which their hunger was appeased. Blessing upon the reader (XII, <b>153</b>)."
