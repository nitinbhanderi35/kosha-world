By a curse of Devendra she was born on earth as Kaliṅgasenā and lived serving in the palace of Udayana, King of Vatsa. She desired to make Udayana her husband. In the meantime a Gandharva named Madanavega fell in love with Kaliṅgasenā. Knowing that Kaliṅgasenā was in love with Udayana the Gandharva followed her in the garb of the King Udayana and at last they were married. Kaliṅgasenā soon delivered Madanamañcukā, an incarnation of Ratidevi. When she grew up she married Naravāhanadatta, son of Udayana. (Madanamañcukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 8)."
