The Maharṣi Atibala was the cause of the death of Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>After the war with Rāvaṇa, Śrī Rāma returned to Ayodhyā with his retinue and began his reign. After renouncing Sītā while Śrī Rāma was living in the palace with Lakṣmaṇa, Śatrughna and their families, one day Brahmā summoned Yama and said: “Śrī Rāma is the incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. He has fulfilled all the purposes of the incarnation. Now Viṣṇu has to be recalled to Vaikuṇṭha”. <dvsn n='NI'/>On hearing this, Yama assuming the guise of a Sannyāsi named Atibala appeared before Śrī Rāma. He said he had to tell a secret to Śrī Rāma. Accordingly Śrī Rāma sent everyone else out of the audience chamber. Lakṣmaṇa was asked to guard the entrance. It was announced that if anyone entered the hall, Lakṣmaṇa would be killed. <dvsn n='NI'/>At this stage, Maharṣi Durvāsas arrived at the entrance accompanied by many of his disciples. He had come after having performed penance for a thousand years and in great hunger and thirst. He wanted to see the King to ask for sumptuous food. Lakṣmaṇa requested him to wait a little but Durvāsas refused to do so. He even threatened that he would reduce all of them to ashes by his curse. Finding no alternative, Lakṣmaṇa entered the hall and informed Śrī Rāma of the situation. Durvāsas was given a sumptuous meal. But for the fulfilment of the condition Lakṣmaṇa's death became necessary. Śrī Rāma cried with a broken heart. The honest Lakṣmaṇa went alone to the Sarayū river and drowned himself in its depths. Soon after, Śrī Rāma entrusting the affairs of the state to others and in the presence of thousands of spectators plunged into the Sarayū river and renouncing his earthly life, returned to Vaikuṇṭha. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa)."
