Ghoṣayātrā). § 512: When the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had arrived at the lake (of <i>Dvaitavana</i>, Nīl.), and were dwelling in the woods visited by <i>veda</i>-knowing ascetics, there came to them a brahman, who afterwards went away to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and told him how the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had become emaciated and reduced by wind and sun. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was much afflicted, considering that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who had formerly used to sleep on beds of <i>raṅku</i> skins and to be wakened by <i>sūtas</i> and <i>māgadhas</i>, now slept on the bare ground; he lamented the treatment he had permitted to be meted out to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, and feared lest they would avenge themselves; <i>Arjuna</i>, he thought, would not have left heaven, where he received the celestial weapons, if it were not for this purpose. This <i>Śakuni</i> told to <i>Duryodhana</i>, who was sitting with <i>Karṇa</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i> was filled with grief (III, <b>236</b>). <i>Śakuni</i> and <i>Karṇa</i> proposed to <i>Duryodhana</i> that they should go to <i>Dvaitavana</i> to exult over the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (III, <b>237</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> gladly approved the proposal, but feared that he might not obtain the permission of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, who thought that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had become more powerful than before in consequence of their ascetic austerities. He asked them, with <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, to find out some skilful pretext. The next morning <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śakuni</i> agreed with <i>Duryodhana</i> that they should go there under the pretext of supervising their cattle stations (III, <b>238</b>). They then all saw <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra</i>. A cowherd, named <i>Samaṅga</i>, who had been instructed beforehand, came to the king and spoke to him of the cattle. <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Śakuni</i> asked him to give permission to <i>Duryodhana</i> to go thither. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> suggested to send some faithful men, fearing some collision with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> if they were to go thither themselves; for though <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> would not suffer his wrath to be awakened, <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Draupadī</i> were naturally passionate. <i>Śakuni</i> promised that they would not go to the spot where the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> resided, and obtained the permission. <i>Duryodhana</i> then started with <i>Karṇa</i>, <i>Duḥśāsana, Śakuni</i>, etc., and ladies by the thousand, followed by the citizens and their wives, with 8,000 chariots, etc., and took up his quarters at the distance of a <i>gavyūti</i> from the lake of <i>Dvaitavana</i> (III, <b>239</b>). Having caused the calves to be marked, etc., <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., began to sport and go a-hunting, and came to the lake. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was then, together with <i>Draupadī</i>, celebrating the diurnal <i>rājarṣi</i> sacrifice according to the ceremonial used in the forest. When the attendants of <i>Duryodhana</i> came to the banks of the lake to construct pleasure-houses, they were forbidden to enter by a number of <i>Gandharvas</i>, who told them that the king of the <i>Gandharvas</i> had come from the abode of <i>Kubera</i>, with his followers and several hosts of <i>Apsarases</i>, etc., and when <i>Duryodhana</i> sent a number of his warriors, they also were prevailed upon by the <i>Gandharvas</i> to return (III, <b>240</b>). A battle ensued between the soldiers of <i>Duryodhana</i> and the <i>Gandharvas</i>, headed by their king <i>Citrasena</i>; the soldiers of <i>Duryodhana</i> fled, except <i>Karṇa</i>, who killed hundreds of <i>Gandharvas. Duryodhana, Śakuni, Duḥśāsana</i>, and <i>Vikarṇa</i> returned to assist <i>Karṇa</i>, and the battle was renewed. <i>Citrasena</i> made use of illusion; it seemed as if every warrior of the <i>Kuru</i> army were surrounded by ten <i>Gandharvas</i>. The entire army of <i>Duryodhana</i> again fled, except <i>Karṇa</i>. The <i>Gandharvas</i> then destroyed the chariot of <i>Karṇa</i>, who, mounting the chariot of <i>Vikarṇa</i>, was forced to drive away (III, <b>241</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> refused to fly, but the <i>Gandharvas</i> destroyed his chariot and slew his charioteer and horses; thereupon <i>Citrasena</i> took him prisoner, and <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, who was seated on his chariot, and <i>Citrasena, Viviṃśati, Vinda</i>, and <i>Anuvinda</i>, and the royal ladies, were taken by other Gandharvas, [and <i>Durviṣaha, Durmukha</i>, and <i>Durjaya</i>, v. 14924]. The flying soldiers and ministers of <i>Duryodhana</i> took refuge with <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (III, <b>242</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, saying that the honour of the family was being destroyed by the <i>Gandharvas'</i> seizing <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., in their presence, prevailed upon his brother to rescue <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc. (v. 14947: “the liberation of a foe from distress is equal to the bestowal of a boon, sovereignty, and the birth of a son, all the three put together”), if possible, by conciliation or lightly skirmishing, otherwise by all means, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> being prohibited from partaking in the combat by his sacrifice. <i>Arjuna</i> promised to rescue <i>Duryodhana</i> or kill the king of the <i>Gandharvas</i> (III, <b>243</b>). The four <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, cased in mail and riding in chariots drawn by fleet horses, encountered the <i>Gandharvas</i>; as these would not set <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., free, as requested by <i>Arjuna</i>, a fierce battle ensued (III, <b>244</b>). The <i>Gandharvas</i>, in vain, attempted to break the chariots of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; especially <i>Arjuna</i>, by means of his <i>Āgneya</i> weapon, sent millions of them to the abode of <i>Yama</i>. The <i>Gandharvas</i> then rose up to the skies, taking the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> with them, and showering maces, darts, etc., upon <i>Arjuna</i>, who killed them with his weapons <i>Sthūlākarṇa</i> (B. Sthūṇākarṇa), <i>Indrajāla, Saura, Āgneya</i>, and <i>Saumya</i>. At last <i>Citrasena</i> rushed at <i>Arjuna</i>, armed with a mace of iron; as <i>Arjuna</i> cut that mace in seven pieces with his arrows, <i>Citrasena</i>, by means of his science, concealed himself from the view of <i>Arjuna</i>, and thus continued to fight with him; but <i>Arjuna</i> destroyed his power of concealing himself by shooting at him with his celestial arms guided by the sound (<i>śabdave-</i> <i>dhaṃ samāśritya</i>). Then <i>Citrasena</i> showed himself to <i>Arjuna</i>, reminding him of his being his friend, and there was put an end to the battle (III, <b>245</b>). <i>Citrasena</i> related to <i>Arjuna</i> that, staying in his abode, he had become acquainted with the purpose of <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc., and had been requested by <i>Indra</i> to bring <i>Duryodhana</i> thither in chains together with his counsellors. <i>Arjuna</i> entreated him to set <i>Duryodhana</i> free, but, at the request of <i>Citrasena</i>, they left it to be decided by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Yudhiṣṭhira</i> then liberated all the <i>Kauravas</i>. The <i>Gandharvas</i> went away with the <i>Apsarases</i>, and <i>Indra</i> revived the slain <i>Gandharvas</i> by sprinkling <i>amṛta</i> upon them. Friendly admonished by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Duryodhana</i>, overwhelmed with shame, returned to his capital (III, <b>246</b>). When <i>Duryodhana</i>, afflicted with grief, was approaching <i>Hāstinapura</i> with his army, <i>Karṇa</i> congratulated him on the honourable victory over the <i>Gandharvas</i> (III, <b>247</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> told <i>Karṇa</i> that, as the <i>Gandharvas</i> had resorted to illusion and ascended the skies, he had been captured with his army, and that it was the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> who had vanquished the <i>Gandharvas</i> (III, <b>248</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> continued his narrative and declared that he would stay there abstaining from food, and that the others, headed by <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, should go to <i>Hāstinapura</i>. He then offered the royal power to <i>Duḥśāsana. Duḥśāsana</i>, his voice choked in tears, refused to accept it. <i>Karṇa</i> reproached them for weeping thus, and declared that the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, who resided in the dominions of <i>Duryodhana</i> and enjoyed happiness under his protection, only did their duty in liberating him (III, <b>249</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> continued explaining his opinion, that those who resided in the king's realm should always exert themselves to the best of their ability for the king; if the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had not followed <i>Duryodhana</i> to the battle it would have been an improper act on their part. <i>Duryodhana</i>, firmly resolved to leave the world, desired not to rise from where he sat (III, <b>250</b>). <i>Śakuni</i> reproached <i>Duryodhana</i> for his foolish despair, saying that he ought rather to reward the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> by granting them their paternal kingdom. <i>Duryodhana</i> embraced <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, but did not waver from his purpose; he spread <i>kuśa</i> grass on the earth, etc., and began to pray and worship mentally.—§ 513: The <i>Daiteyas</i> and <i>Dānavas</i> who had formerly been vanquished by the gods and were dwelling in <i>Pātāla</i>, having ascertained <i>Duryodhana's</i> purpose, commenced a sacrifice with formulas, revealed by <i>Bṛhaspati</i> and <i>Uśanas</i>, according to the rites indicated in the <i>Atharvaveda</i> and the <i>Upaniṣad</i>, assisted by <i>brahmans</i> of rigid vows, well versed in the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Vedāṅgas</i>. After these rites were ended a sorceress (<i>kṛtyā</i>) arose, whom the <i>Daityas</i> caused to bring <i>Duryodhana</i> to them in the night (III, <b>251</b>). The <i>Dānavas</i> said to him: “Do not do such a rash act as the vow of starvation. The suicide ever sinks into hell (<i>adho yāti</i>), and is blamed…In days of old we had obtained thee by ascetic austerities from <i>Maheśvara</i>; the upper part of thy body is wholly made of <i>vajras</i>, and is, therefore, invulnerable to weapons of every description; the lower part of thy body was made of flowers by <i>Devī</i> herself …Brave <i>kṣatriyas</i>, headed by <i>Bhagadatta</i>, will slay thy foes…In order to aid thee many <i>Dānavas</i> (v. 15172: <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Rakṣases</i>) have been born on earth. Other <i>Asuras</i> will also possess <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa</i>, and others; possessed by those <i>Asuras</i> these heroes will abandon their kindness and fight with thy foes…We have already settled the means of slaying <i>Arjuna</i>; the slain <i>Naraka</i> has assumed the form of <i>Karṇa</i>; recollecting his former hostility he will encounter both <i>Keśava</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) and <i>Arjuna</i>, and vanquish <i>Arjuna</i> in battle. <i>Indra</i> in disguise will deprive <i>Karṇa</i> of his earrings and coat of mail. We also have appointed innumerable <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Rākṣasas</i>, the so-called <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>, who will slay <i>Arjuna</i>…Thou art ever our refuge, as the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> are the refuge of the gods.” Then the <i>Dānavas</i> embraced and cheered him, and that very goddess (<i>kṛtyā</i>) carried him back to the spot where he had sat down intent upon putting an end to his life, and there she vanished. Now <i>Duryodhana</i> considered all as a dream, and thought he should defeat the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in battle. And also <i>Karṇa</i>, being possessed by the soul of <i>Naraka</i>, and the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>, possessed by the <i>Rākṣasas</i>, were desirous of slaying <i>Arjuna</i>; and <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa</i>, etc., influenced by the <i>Dānavas</i>, were not so affectionate towards the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> as they had been. <i>Duryodhana</i> did not tell anyone of this.—§ 514: When the night had passed away <i>Karṇa</i> again exhorted <i>Duryodhana</i>, and promised to slay <i>Arjuna</i> in battle. <i>Duryodhana</i> arose and arranged his army, and went to <i>Hāstinapura</i>, accompanied by <i>Karṇa, Śakuni</i>, his brothers headed by <i>Duḥśāsana</i> and <i>Bhūriśravas</i>, and <i>Somadatta</i>, and <i>Bāhlīka</i> (III, <b>252</b>).— § 515: <i>Karṇadigvijaya</i> (q.v.).—§ 516: <i>Duryodhanayajña</i> (q.v.).—§ 517: Hearing the vow of <i>Karṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, filled with anxiety, made up his mind to abandon <i>Dvaitavana</i>. <i>Duryodhana</i> with his brothers, and <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa</i>, and <i>Karṇa</i> ruled the earth justly and worshipped the brahmans by sacrifices and profuse gifts (III, <b>257</b>)."
