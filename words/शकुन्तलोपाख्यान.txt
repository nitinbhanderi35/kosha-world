Duṣyanta</i>, during the absence of <i>Kaṇva</i>, wedded <i>Śakuntalā</i> according to the <i>Gāndharva</i> form, promising her that her son should be the heir apparent, and departing told her that he should send troops to take her to his capital. <i>Kaṇva</i>, by his spiritual knowledge, knew what she had done, and approved of it, and bestowed on her the boon that the <i>Paurava</i> monarchs might ever be virtuous and never be deprived of their thrones (I, <b>73</b>). <i>Śakuntalā</i>, after three years, brought forth a beautiful boy, for whom <i>Kaṇva</i> caused all the religious rites to be performed, and who, when he was only 6 years of age, used to seize and bind to the trees lions, etc., wherefore he was called <i>Sarvadamana</i>. Then <i>Kaṇva</i> caused his disciples to bring <i>Śakuntalā</i> and the boy to <i>Hāstinapura</i> and introduce them to <i>Duṣyanta</i>. Then they returned to the hermitage. <i>Duṣyanta</i> feigned not to remember anything. Then <i>Śakuntalā</i> became angry (“But knowest thou not the Ancient Wise [<i>muniṃ purāṇaṃ</i>, i.e. Nārāyaṇa] who lies in the heart? He who sins is observed by the gods and by him also who occupies every heart. The sun, the moon, the air, fire, earth, sky, water, the heart, <i>Yama</i>, the day, the night, both twilights, and <i>Dharma</i>, all witness the acts of man. <i>Yama Vaivasvata</i> takes no account of the sins of that person with whom [Nārāyaṇa] the witness of all acts is gratified. But that person with whom he [Nārāyaṇa] is not gratified is tortured for his sins by <i>Yama…</i> The son that is born to persons cognizant of the <i>Vedic mantras</i> rescues the spirits of deceased ancestors. Because the son rescues the father from the hell which is called <i>Put</i>, therefore he has been called <i>puttra</i> by <i>Svayambhū</i> himself… Even <i>ṛṣis</i> cannot create creatures without women… ‘He shall perform a hundred horse sacrifices,’ were the words uttered in the skies when I was in the lying-in room… <i>Urvaśī, Pūrvacitti, Sahajanyā, Menakā, Viśvācī</i>, and <i>Ghṛtācī</i>, these are the six foremost <i>Apsarases</i>; amongst them, again, <i>Menakā</i>, born of <i>Brahmán</i>, is the first…I can repair to the abodes of <i>Indra, Kubera, Yama</i>, and <i>Varuṇa…</i> The <i>Pitṛs</i> have said that the son continues the race, and he is therefore the best of all religious acquirements…<i>Manu</i> has said that there are five kinds of sons…”). Then she left his presence. But a voice from the sky commanded <i>Duṣyanta</i> to cherish (<i>bhara</i>) his son, who should therefore be called <i>Bharata</i>. It was this voice of the <i>Devadūta</i> that <i>Duṣyanta</i> had waited for, that the people should not regard his son as of impure birth. <i>Bharata</i> reduced to subjection all the kings of the earth and became a <i>sārvabhauma-cakravartin</i>, and performed many sacrifices with <i>Kaṇva</i> as the chief priest. From him has come the <i>Bharata</i> race, of whom the principal ones shall be mentioned (I, <b>74</b>)."
