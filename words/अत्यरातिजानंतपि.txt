When Vāsiṣṭha reminded him of his indebtedness, and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that he intended to conquer the <b>Uttara Kurus,</b> and that Vāsiṣṭha would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being his general (<i>senā-pati</i>). Vāsiṣṭha replied that as no mortal man could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward. He consequently procured Atyarāti's defeat and death at the hands of <b>Amitratapana Śuṣmiṇa Śaibya.</b><sup>1</sup> <F>1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 23. <i>Cf.</i> Weber, <i>Indische Studien,</i> 1, 214.</F>"
