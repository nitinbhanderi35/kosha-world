But <lang>Tib.</lang> on both <ls>Mvy</ls> and <ls>LV</ls> says simply <i>hare- (sheep-, cow-)speck</i> (<tib>rdul</tib>); to be sure, <ls>Das</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> <tib>rdul</tib> declares that <tib>glaṅ rdul</tib> means <i>a mote in the dung of an ox, a small particle of cowdung</i>. But this, as well as the different guess from <lang>Chin.</lang>, can hardly be anything but implausible guesswork. Why should a speck on the skin, or in the dung, of an animal vary with the size of the animal? The <lang>Tib.</lang> itself gives no such indication. It seems safe to assume that <i>hare-speck, sheep-speck</i>, and <i>cow-speck</i> mean only three different sizes of small particles."
