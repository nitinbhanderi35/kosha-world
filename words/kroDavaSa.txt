Most of these Krodhavaśas were employed to guard the lotus-lake of Kubera. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 154). Bhīmasena once entered the lotus-lake of Kubera and plucked the “Saugandhika” flower. The Krodhavaśas ran to Kubera to inform him of this theft. It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 285, Stanza 2 that these Krodhavaśas were present in the army of Rāvaṇa."
