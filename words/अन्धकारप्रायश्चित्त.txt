(-त्तम्) A penance mentioned in the Varāha-Purāṇa, to atone for the offence of approaching, in the dark, the image of Viṣṇu in his incarnation as a boar, without a lamp and without the Śāstra; such an offence degrading the offender and exposing him to becoming blind: the penance consists in veiling the eyes during fifteen days, taking only one meal on the following twentieth day and one meal on each twelfth day of the half of a month, and when the penitent is half dead in consequence of such diet, sitting in the water and ultimately eating a dish of barley and rice cooked in cow's urine. He is promised to be rid then of his crime. Another reading of this word is अन्धका- रस्पृष्टप्रायश्चित्त. E. अन्धकार and प्रायश्चित्त."
