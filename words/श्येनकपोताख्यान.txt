Śyenakapotīya (§ 411 = III, <b>130</b> foll.), but here the birds are not <i>Indra</i> and <i>Agni</i>]. The three worlds together with <i>Indra</i> came to behold the king; he was bathed in a shower of nectar, etc.; D., G., and Aps. began to sing and dance around him, just, as they do around <i>Brahmán</i>; he then ascended a celestial chariot and proceeded to the eternal heaven. Blessing upon the reader."
