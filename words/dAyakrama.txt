The system of inheritance as described by Manu is as follows:— <dvsn n='NI'/>1) After the death of the parents, all the children should divide their wealth among themselves. When either the father or the mother is alive, the sons should not take their wealth. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) If the wealth is not divided, the eldest brother should keep the whole of it in his custody and maintain his brothers and sisters like a father. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) Of the entire wealth, the eldest brother may take onetwentieth part, the second brother, one-fortieth part and the third brother, one-eghtieth part and the balance is to be divided equally among all of them. <dvsn n='NI'/>4) If there are more than three sons, the eldest and the youngest may take one-twentieth and one-eightieth (of the entire wealth) respectively, and each of the other brothers may take one-fortieth. The rest of the property must be divided equally among all of them. <dvsn n='NI'/>5) After dividing like this, if there are unmarried sisters, each of the brothers should give one-fourth of his share for their marriage. <dvsn n='NI'/>6) The ornaments which the mother had received by way of her dowry etc. may be taken after her death by her unmarried daughters. <dvsn n='NI'/>7) If, after his marriage, one of the brothers dies, the brother who keeps his movable and immovable properties, must beget children by the brother's wife and hand over the above properties to her issue. (See under Manusmṛti)."
