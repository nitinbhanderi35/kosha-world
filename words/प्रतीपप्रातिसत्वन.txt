The identification cannot, however, be regarded as at all certain, and while the Epic may have derived its genealogy from the Atharvaveda, it may have preserved an independent tradition. Böhtlingk<sup>5</sup> renders <i>prātisatvanam</i> as ‘in the direction opposed to the Satvans’, and this may be right. <F>1) So Khila, v. 15, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33, 2.</F> <F>2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. <i>Cf.</i> Scheftelowitz, <i>Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda,</i> 161; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 18, 1.</F> <F>2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. <i>Cf.</i> Scheftelowitz, <i>Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda,</i> 161; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 18, 1.</F> <F>3) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 131.</F> <F>4) xx. 127.</F> <F>5) Dictionary, <i>s.v.</i></F>"
