At that time, he made an attempt to steal lotus flower from Brahmasaras in Kauśikī tīrtha. Indra struck down at a single blow, Yātudhānī, the woman guard of the saras, who opposed him. From this time when Indra went about in the company of the dog, he got the name “Śunassakha”. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 94)."
