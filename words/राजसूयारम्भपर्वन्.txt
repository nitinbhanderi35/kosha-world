Rājasūyasya ārambhaḥ.)—§ 272: <i>Yudhiṣ-</i> <i>ṭhira</i> consulted his counsellors, brothers, <i>ṛtvijes</i>, ministers, <i>Dhaumya, Dvaipāyana</i>, etc., as to the <i>rājasūya</i> (“in which <i>ṛṣis</i> of austere vows establish six fires singing <i>mantras</i> of the <i>Sāmaveda</i>; at the conclusion thereof the performer, when installed in the sovereignty, is rewarded with the fruit of all sacrifices, including the <i>darvīhomas</i>”). They all encouraged him to perform it. All people lived happily under his sway and loved him (therefore he was called <i>Ajātaśatru</i>); <i>Bhīma</i> ruled over all men justly, <i>Arjuna</i> protected the people from enemies, <i>Sahadeva</i> administered justice impartially, <i>Nakula</i> behaved towards everybody with humility. There was no extortion, disease, etc. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> sent a messenger to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> in <i>Dvāravatī</i>, and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came to <i>Indraprastha</i> accompanied by <i>Indrasena</i>, and was consulted by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (II, <b>13</b>).—§ 273: <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, in order to become <i>samrāj</i>, ought to slay the <i>Magadha</i> king <i>Jarāsandha</i>, and deliver the princes whom <i>Jarāsandha</i> held shut up in a mountain hole in order to sacrifice them to <i>Mahādeva</i> (i.e. Śiva). “The now existing <i>kṣatriyas</i> are descended from the remnants of those who were exterminated by <i>Rāma</i>. They represent themselves to be the descendants of <i>Aila</i> and <i>Ikṣvāku</i>; of those there are 100 families. The <i>Bhojas</i>, descendants of <i>Yayāti</i>, are great and scattered all over the earth; but now <i>Jarāsandha</i>, ruling the middle land (i.e. Mathurā, Nīl.), has overpowered them. His allies are (1) <i>Śiśupāla</i>, who has become his <i>senāpati</i>; (2) the <i>Karūṣa</i> king <i>Vakra</i>, who fights by illusion (<i>māyāyodhin</i>); (3—4) <i>Haṃsa</i> and <i>Ḍimbhaka</i> (see below); (5—8) <i>Dantavakra, Karūṣa, Karabha, Meghavāhana</i>; (9) <i>Bhagadatta</i>, the <i>Yavana</i> king, the ruler of the west, who bears on his head the most wonderful gem on earth, the old friend of thy father, and who chastises <i>Muru</i> and <i>Naraka</i>; he obeys <i>Jarāsandha</i>, but in his heart he is tied by affection to thee; (10) the king of <i>Aṅga, Vaṅga, Puṇḍra</i>, and of the <i>Kirātas, Pauṇḍraka Vāsudeva</i>, who among the <i>Cedis</i> is called <i>Puruṣottama</i>, and always bears, from foolishness, the distinctive signs of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>; (11) <i>Bhīṣmaka</i>, king of the <i>Bhojas</i>, the friend of <i>Indra</i>, who governs a fourth part of the world, who by his learning has conquered the <i>Pāṇḍyas, Krathas</i>, and <i>Kaiśikas</i>, and whose brother <i>Ākṛti</i> is like to <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>, has placed himself under <i>Jarāsandha</i>, though <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc., his relatives, are engaged every day in doing what is agreeable to him. Only <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> maternal uncle, the <i>Kunti</i> king <i>Purujit</i>, who has his dominions in the west and the south, regards <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with affection. The following peoples have fled for fear of <i>Jarāsandha</i>: (1) the eighteen tribes of the northern <i>Bhojas</i> have fled towards the west; (2—10) the <i>Śūrasenas</i>, <i>Bhadrakāras, Bodhas, Śālvas, Paṭaccaras, Susthalas, Mukuṭṭas</i> (B. Su°), <i>Kulindas</i>, and <i>Kuntis</i>; (11—13) the <i>Śālvāyana</i> kings with their brethren and followers, the southern <i>Pāñcālas</i>, and the eastern <i>Kośalas</i>, have all fled to the <i>Kuntis(?</i>); (14—15) the <i>Matsyas</i> and the <i>Sannyastapādas</i> (? so B.; C. Sanya°) have left their dominions in the north and fled into the southern country; (16) all the <i>Pāñcālas</i> have fled in all directions.” <i>Jarāsandha's</i> relations to the <i>Yādavas</i> were the following: <i>Kaṃsa</i>, having persecuted the <i>Yādavas</i>, married <i>Asti</i> and <i>Prāpti</i>, daughters of <i>Jarāsandha</i> and sisters of <i>Sahadeva</i>, and began also to oppress the old chiefs of the <i>Bhojas</i>, who sought the help of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc.; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> bestowed upon <i>Akrūra</i> the daughter of <i>Āhuka</i>, and with <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa</i> (i.e. Balarāma) he slew <i>Kaṃsa</i> and <i>Sunāman</i>. Then <i>Jarāsandha</i> took up arms, and the eighteen tribes (<i>kulair aṣṭādaśāvaraiḥ</i> (?), differently Nīl.) thought they would be unable to check him even in 300 years. His friends <i>Haṃsa</i> and <i>Ḍimbhaka</i> were incapable of being slain by weapons. Some other king, named <i>Haṃsa</i> (differently Nīl.), was slain by <i>Rāma</i> in the battle of the eighteen tribes (<i>aṣṭādaśāvare?</i>); then <i>Ḍimbhaka</i>, thinking that he could not live without <i>Haṃsa</i>, killed himself in the <i>Yamunā</i>, and <i>Haṃsa</i>, hearing that, also jumped into the <i>Yamunā</i>; then <i>Jarāsandha</i> returned to his kingdom, and the <i>Yādavas</i> continued to live at <i>Mathurā</i>. But the widow of <i>Kaṃsa</i> (PCR. <i>Haṃsa</i>), the daughter of <i>Jarāsandha</i>, urging him to revenge the death of her husband, the <i>Yādavas</i> fled from <i>Mathurā</i>, and took up their abode in <i>Kuśasthalī</i> (i.e. <i>Dvāravatī</i>), adorned by <i>Raivata</i>, and strongly fortified the <i>Gomanta</i> mountains, three <i>yojanas</i> in length. “In the race of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> there are 8,000 brothers [and cousins, PCR.]. <i>Āhuka</i> has 100 sons. <i>Cārudeṣṇa</i> with his brother, <i>Cakradeva</i>, <i>Sātyaki, Kṛṣṇa, Rauhiṇeya</i> (i.e. <i>Balarāma</i>), and <i>Śāmba</i> (like <i>Śauri</i> in battle) are seven heroes (<i>rathāḥ); Kṛtavarman</i>, <i>Anādhṛṣṭi, Śamīka, Samitiñjaya, Kaṅka, Śaṅku</i>, and <i>Kunti</i> are seven <i>mahārathas</i>; then there are also two sons of <i>Andhakabhoja</i> and himself; all these heroes, remembering the middle country, are now living among the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>” (II, <b>14</b>).—§ 274: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had some scruples, which were opposed by <i>Bhīma</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who cited from the <i>Kṛta</i> age five kings, who had become emperors (<i>samrāj</i>): <i>Yauvanāśvi</i> (i.e. <i>Māndhātṛ</i>) by the remission of taxes (B. <i>jitvā jayyān</i>, “by victories”), <i>Bhagīratha</i> by protection, [Arjuna-] <i>Kārtavīrya</i> by asceticism, <i>Bharata</i> by strength, and <i>Marutta</i> by prosperity; 100 families of kings have been unable to oppose <i>Jarāsandha</i>; he has already brought eighty-six kings to the house of <i>Paśupati</i> (i.e. Śiva); when he has fourteen more he will offer them as sacrifices (II, <b>15</b>).— Some further objections of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> are refuted by <i>Arjuna</i> (II, <b>16</b>).—§ 275: The origin of <i>Jarāsandha</i> was the following: The <i>Magadha</i> king <i>Bṛhadratha</i>, who had three akṣauhiṇīs of troops, married the two twin daughters of the king of <i>Kāśi</i>, making an engagement never to show a preference for either. As he was childless he repaired to the ṛṣi <i>Caṇḍa-Kauśika</i>, the son of <i>Kākṣīvat Gautama</i>, who was sitting under a mango-tree. He gave a mango fruit to the king, who gave it to his queens. They then brought forth each one half of a child, which were thrown away, but, found and laid together by the <i>rākṣasī Jarā</i>, became one living child (II, <b>17</b>).—<i>Jarā</i> had been created by <i>Svayambhū</i> for the destruction of the <i>Dānavas</i> and named <i>Gṛhadevī</i> (<i>gṛhe gṛhe manuṣyāṇāṃ nityaṃ tiṣṭhāmi rākṣasī</i>, v. 730), and always lived in the king's house and did him good, because there was on the walls a likeness of her endued with youth and in the midst of children, and she was daily worshipped with scents, etc. The king ordered a great festival to be held in <i>Magadha</i> in honour of <i>Jarā</i>, and named the boy <i>Jarāsandha</i> (<i>Jarayā sandhito</i>, v. 739) (II, <b>18</b>). Some time after <i>Caṇḍa-Kauśika</i> again came to <i>Magadha</i>, and foretold the greatness of <i>Jarāsandha</i>, that weapons should not hurt him, and that he should see <i>Rudra</i>. After having installed <i>Jarāsandha, Bṛhadratha</i> with his two wives retired to the woods and, after practising ascetic penances, ascended to heaven. When king <i>Kaṃsa</i> was slain by <i>Vāsudeva</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇa), <i>Jarāsandha</i>, from <i>Girivraja</i>, whirling a mace ninety-nine times, hurled it towards <i>Mathurā</i>, where <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> was residing at that time; the mace fell at <i>Gadāvasāna</i>, near <i>Mathurā</i>, at a distance of ninety-nine <i>yojanas</i> [from Girivraja, PCR.]. He, with <i>Haṃsa</i> and <i>Ḍimbhaka</i> (who were skilled in the <i>nītiśāstra</i>, v. 765), were more than a match for the three worlds; therefore, from policy, the <i>Kukuras, Andhakas</i>, and <i>Vṛṣṇis</i>, chose not to fight with him (II, <b>19</b>)."
