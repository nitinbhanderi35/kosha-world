Asked as to the reason of his strength, his Purohita, Vasiṣṭha explained that in the previous birth he was a goldsmith in the service of a Śaivite courtesan, Līlāvatī. She performed the gift of Lavanācala when he helped her in making up the salt mountain in gold without receiving anything as wages. The present position was its consequence. Then he made gifts of ten Merus to Vasiṣṭha. <dvsn n='P'/>M. 92. 17-33."
