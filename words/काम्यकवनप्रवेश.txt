Arjunābhigamanap.). § 328: As <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> declared that <i>Bhūriśravas, Śala, Jalasandha</i>, etc., and <i>Karṇa</i> (master of all weapons, etc.), and the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, together with the kings who had been injured by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, could not now be vanquished, that all the <i>Kaurava</i> soldiers and their families had been honoured with wealth and luxuries by <i>Duryodhana</i>, and would sacrifice their lives for him, and that, although <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Kṛpa</i>, all knowing celestial weapons and being invincible, behaved equally towards both parties, they would certainly, to pay off the royal favours they enjoyed, lay down their very lives in battle, <i>Bhīma</i> remained silent.—§ 329: While they were conversing thus <i>Vyāsa</i> appeared, and, taking <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> into a corner, taught him, after he had purified himself (<i>śuddhaye</i>), the science of <i>Pratismṛti</i>, by means of which <i>Arjuna</i> (<i>b</i>) should proceed to <i>Mahendra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Kubera</i>, and <i>Yama</i>, to receive weapons from them. He also advised him to go to some other forest in order not to cause uneasiness to the ascetics and exterminate the deer and destroy the plants. Then <i>Vyāsa</i> disappeared. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> went to the forest of <i>Kāmyaka</i> on the banks of the <i>Sarasvatī</i>, followed by numerous brahmans versed in <i>śikṣā</i> and <i>akṣara</i> (see § 322), and lived there devoted to the <i>Dhanurveda</i>, and sacrificing to the <i>Pitṛs</i>, the gods, and the brahmans (III, <b>36</b>)."
