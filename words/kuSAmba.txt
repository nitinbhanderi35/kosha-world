(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 2). <dvsn n='NI'/>(ii) Two sons, Śakra and Gādhi were born to Kuśāmba and to Gādhi was born a daughter, Satyavatī. Viśvāmitra was Gādhi's son. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 57). <dvsn n='NI'/>This statement is not quite correct. Certain other Purāṇas maintain that Gādhi, the father of Viśvāmitra was the son of Kuśanābha, who was the son of Kuśika and brother of Kuśāmba. (See under Kuśanābha)."
