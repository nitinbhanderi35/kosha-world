            "word": "वर्णार्थवत्त्व",
            "content": "the theory or view that individual letters are severally possessed of different senses. For instance, the difference in the meanings of the words कूप, यूप, and सृप is due to the difference in their initial letter. The theory is not acceptable to the Vaiyakaranas nor the theory वर्णानर्थवत्व given above. They follow the theory of संघातार्थवत्त्व i. e. sense given by a group of words together. See M.Bh, on Siva Sutra 5, Varttikas 9 to 15."
