Then <i>Svāhā</i>, the daughter of <i>Dakṣa</i>, who had in vain loved <i>Agni</i> from her childhood, prevailed upon <i>Skanda</i> that she should live for ever with <i>Agni</i>, in so far as offerings with <i>mantras</i> to the gods and <i>pitṛs (havyaṃ</i> <i>kavyañ ca</i>) should always be coupled with the name of <i>Svāhā</i>. —§ 504. Then <i>Skanda</i> was sent by <i>Brahmán</i> to his father <i>Rudra</i>; for <i>Rudra</i> and <i>Umā</i> had entered <i>Agni</i> and <i>Svāhā</i>, and from this combination <i>Skanda</i> had sprung; <i>Rudra's</i> semen had been thrown back upon the hill, whence sprang forth <i>Miñjikā</i> and <i>Miñjika</i>, and portions of it fell into the Blood Sea, into the rays of the sun, upon the earth, and upon the trees, whence sprang forth the various troops of his <i>pāriṣadas</i>, living on flesh. These five classes of spirits should be honoured with sun-flowers (<i>arkapuṣpaiḥ</i>: Calotropis gigantea) for the sake of wealth and healing of diseases; <i>Miñjikā</i> and <i>Miñjika</i> must be honoured for the welfare of children; the females, named <i>Vṛddhikās</i>, who were produced in the trees and live on human flesh, must be worshipped by persons who desire to have children. These are the innumerable <i>gaṇas</i> of <i>Piśācas</i>.—§ 505. <i>Airāvata</i> had two bells named <i>Vaijayantī; Indra</i> gave one of them to <i>Viśākha</i> and the other one to <i>Skanda</i>; the standards of <i>Skanda</i> and <i>Viśākha</i> were red. <i>Skanda</i>, surrounded by troops of <i>Piśācas</i> and gods, sat on the golden mountain with the toys that had been given to him by the gods. Description of the <i>Śveta</i> mountain.— § 506. Then <i>Śiva</i>, with <i>Pārvatī</i>, rode in their shining chariot, yoked with 1,000 lions and managed by <i>Kāla</i>, to <i>Bhadravaṭa</i>; they were preceded by <i>Kubera</i> (riding in <i>Puṣpaka</i>) with the <i>Guhyakas</i>, and followed by <i>Indra</i> (riding on <i>Airāvata</i>) and the gods; in the right wing of his army was the great <i>Yakṣa Amogha</i>, with the <i>Jṛmbhakas, Yakṣas</i>, <i>Rakṣases, Vasus, Rudras</i>, etc.; there was also <i>Yama</i>, with <i>Mṛtyu</i>, surrounded by hundreds of terrible diseases; behind <i>Yama</i> the trident of <i>Śiva</i>, named <i>Vijaya</i>, surrounded by <i>Varuṇa</i>, with various aquatic animals; the <i>paṭṭiśa</i> of <i>Rudra</i> surrounded by clubs, etc., and followed by the umbrella of <i>Rudra</i>, and after this the water-vessel, worshipped by the troops and maharṣis, and on the right side of this the sceptre (<i>daṇḍaḥ</i>), with <i>Bhṛgus, Aṅgirases</i>, and gods. Behind these rode <i>Rudra</i> in his white chariot, followed by rivers, etc.; <i>Apsarases, nakṣatras</i>, planets, the children of the gods, etc., and <i>Parjanya. Soma</i> held a white umbrella over his head, and <i>Agni</i> and <i>Vāyu</i> held the two fans. Behind him came <i>Indra</i> and the <i>rājarṣis</i>, and <i>Gaurī, Vidyā</i>, etc., and the sciences (<i>vidyāgaṇāḥ</i>). In the front the <i>Rākṣasa graha</i> advanced, holding the standard. The foremost of <i>Yakṣas</i>, <i>Piṅgala</i>, the friend of <i>Rudra</i>, who is always busy in places where corpses are burned, at one time was ahead of the army and at another behind it. <i>Rudra</i> is worshipped by mortals with virtuous actions in various forms. At the request of <i>Śiva, Skanda</i> took the command of the seventh army corps (<i>skandhasya</i>) and was advised always to look up to <i>Śiva</i>, then he should attain great welfare.—§ 507. Omens frightened <i>Śiva, Pārvatī</i>, the gods, and the <i>Dānavas (Asuras, Daityas</i>); <i>Indra</i> encouraged the gods when about to flee; the <i>Dānava</i> <i>Mahiṣa</i> crushed 10,000 of the gods with a mountain, put <i>Indra</i> and the gods to flight, and seized the pole of <i>Rudra's</i> chariot, while heaven and earth groaned, etc., and the <i>maharṣis</i> lost their senses, but (as <i>Rudra</i> did not choose to kill him himself) <i>Skanda</i> killed him, cutting off his head that barred the entrance of sixteen <i>yojanas</i> [to the <i>Uttara-Kurus</i>, Nīl.], though the <i>Uttara-Kurus</i> at present pass easily by that gate. The <i>Dānavas</i> fell in large numbers from the lance and arrows of <i>Skanda</i>; the lance always returned to his hand again after killing thousands of enemies; the <i>pāriṣadas</i> of <i>Skanda</i> devoured them and drank their blood. When the <i>Dānavas</i> were defeated, <i>Skanda</i> went to <i>Śiva</i> and was embraced and praised by <i>Indra</i>. Then <i>Indra</i>, with the gods, took leave from <i>Śiva</i> and left the place, and <i>Rudra</i> returned to <i>Bhadravaṭa</i>, after having recommended to the gods to render allegiance to <i>Skanda</i> just as to himself. In one day <i>Skanda</i> had killed the <i>Dānavas</i> and conqucred the three worlds* (ch. <b>231</b>)."
