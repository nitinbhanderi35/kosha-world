            "content": "[<b>Svargārohaṇaparvan</b>¦ or <b>°haṇikap°</b>] (“the section relating to the ascension to heaven”, the 18th of the greater and the 100th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Svargaparvan, Svargārohaṇika(ṃ) [parva(n)]. § 795. <i>Janamejaya</i> said: “Having attained to Heaven, what regions were respectively reached by my grandfathers, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras?</i> Thou hast been taught everything by M-ṛ <i>Vyāsa</i>.” <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> said: “Having arrived in Heaven, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> beheld <i>Duryodhana</i> blazing with effulgence and seated in the midst of Sā.; he expressed his indignation (α) and wished to come to his brothers; <i>Nārada</i> solicited him to desist from his wrath (β); <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> indignantly (γ) asked for his brothers and <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (δ) (XVIII, <b>1</b>); <i>Karṇa</i> especially lay to him at heart, since his mother had ordered him to offer oblations of water unto <i>Karṇa</i>, and he had noticed the resemblance between the feet of his mother and those of <i>Karṇa</i>; he would not stay in Heaven if his brothers were not there. The gods ordered a celestial messenger to lead <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to the region reached by his brothers. The path was enveloped in darkness and stench, etc. (description); as he was about to turn back, he heard voices uttering piteous lamentations, calling him by name, and giving evidence to the happiness felt by his presence, and they turned out to come from <i>Karṇa</i> and his brothers, etc. (ε); he could not understand this perverse order of things (ζ); he censured the gods and <i>Dharma</i>, and declared that he would stay in Hell in order to comfort his relatives. The messenger returned and represented this to <i>Indra</i> (XVIII, <b>2</b>). All the gods: M. with <i>Indra</i>, V., A., Sā., R., Ā., Si., M-ṛ. and <i>Dharma</i> came to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; the illusions of Hell (the river <i>Vaitaraṇī</i>, etc.) disappeared; <i>Indra</i> informed him that Hell should be seen by every king; he who first endures Hell must afterwards enjoy Heaven, and vice versa; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> must see Hell because he had deceived <i>Droṇa</i> in the matter of his son; similarly <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (η) had been shown Hell; but they have all been cleansed of their sins, and they had, as also <i>Karṇa</i>, attained to regions of felicity; D., G., and Aps. should wait upon <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; his regions are far above those of kings and equal to those of <i>Hariścandra</i>, etc. (θ). <i>Dharma</i> said that this was the third test to which he had put him (ι). Having bathed in the celestial <i>Gaṅgā</i>, he left his human body and assumed a celestial form, and became divested of all his enmities and grief. Accompanied by <i>Dharma</i> and praised by M-ṛ, he reached that place where the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, freed from wrath, were enjoying each his respective status (XVIII, <b>3</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, praised by D., M., and Ṛ., proceeded to that place where the foremost ones of the <i>Kurus</i> were; he beheld <i>Govinda</i> (Kṛṣṇa) in his <i>Brāhma-</i>form (description), adored by <i>Arjuna</i>; in another place <i>Karṇa</i> in the company of <i>Sūrya</i>, etc. (κ); as <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to question <i>Draupadī, Indra</i> declared that she was <i>Śrī</i>, created for the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> by <i>Śiva</i>; her five sons are G.; G-king <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was his uncle <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>; <i>Pāṇḍu</i> frequently comes to <i>Indra</i> in his excellent chariot; <i>Bhīṣma</i> is now in the midst of V.; others walk with G. and Y., etc., or Gh. (XVIII, <b>4</b>). <i>Janamejaya</i> asked for what period <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (λ) remained in Heaven, and what became of them when the effect of their actions were exhausted. <i>Sauti</i> said: Thus questioned B-ṛ <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> with the permission of <i>Vyāsa</i> said: Everyone is not capable of returning to his own nature [i.e. final Emancipation, PCR.] when his deeds cease to work [the meaning seems to be that some persons lose their individuality by being absorbed into some deity before final Emancipation, but the text itself is corrupt]; this is a mystery of the gods, explained by <i>Vyāsa</i>, who is omniscient; <i>Bhīṣma</i> attained to the state of V. [absorbed in V., not as a separate individual: <i>sāyujya</i>, not <i>sālokya</i>, PCR.]; therefore, now eight <i>Vasus</i> are seen; etc. (μ). <i>Sauti</i> then related the conclusion of <i>Janamejaya's (b</i>) snake-sacrifice. “I have now told thee everything that <i>Vaiśampāyana</i> narrated, at the command of <i>Vyāsa</i>, unto the king at his snake-sacrifice. It is a sacred tale, etc., composed by <i>Vyāsa</i>” (eulogy of <i>Vyāsa</i>) (ν),*; eulogy, etc., of <i>Mahābhārata (c</i>) (XVIII, <b>5-6</b>)."
