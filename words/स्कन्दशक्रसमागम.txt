The planets (<i>grahāḥ</i>) and <i>upagrahas</i> (see BR.), <i>Mātṛs</i> and the <i>gaṇas</i> of the <i>pariṣads</i> preceded by Fire and other terrible gods waited on <i>Skanda</i>. <i>Indra</i>, with the hosts of the gods approached, mounted on <i>Airāvata</i>, in order to kill him. But <i>Skanda</i> defeated them by flames, and when <i>Indra</i> pierced his right side with his thunderbolt, thence sprang forth an armed youth <i>Viśākha</i> (<i>vajra-viśanād jāto</i>, v. 14384), and <i>Indra</i> and the gods sought and obtained the protection of <i>Skanda</i> (III, <b>227</b>)."
