When the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had encamped on the bank of the <i>Hiraṇvatī</i>, the <i>Kauravas</i> also fixed their encampment. Then <i>Duryodhana</i> consulted with <i>Karṇa</i>, etc. (α), and sent <i>Ulūka</i> to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Somakas</i> in order to irritate them still more, with insulting messages to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (the story of the wicked cat), <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (β); before <i>Arjuna</i> he should mention the <i>Kāmbojas</i>, etc. (γ), among his troops; “I know that the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> is full 6 cubits long” (V, <b>160</b>). <i>Ulūka</i> repeated the messages to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (V, <b>161</b>), and repeated his words to <i>Arjuna</i> once more; <i>Bhīmasena</i> and the rest became furious; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> counselled <i>Ulūka</i> to retire in time; <i>Ulūka</i> once more repeated his words; they became still more enraged, especially <i>Bhīma</i>, who said that he would certainly drink <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> blood; also <i>Sahadeva</i>, etc. (δ), gave him answers for <i>Duryodhana; Sahadeva</i> would slay <i>Ulūka</i> before the eyes of <i>Śakuni</i>, and then <i>Śakuni</i> himself (V, <b>162</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> said that <i>Duryodhana's</i> contrivance of seeking cover behind <i>Bhīṣma</i> would be of no avail, as he would himself slay <i>Bhīṣma</i>; the same said <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i> (“I have been created by the Creator for the destruction of <i>Bhīṣma</i>”); <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> would slay <i>Droṇa</i> with all his followers and friends. <i>Ulūka</i> related it all to <i>Duryodhana</i>. Messengers instructed by <i>Karṇa</i> promulgated: “array tomorrow before sunrise” (V, <b>163</b>). <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> began to select combatants in order to pit them against particular warriors of the hostile force (ε) (V, <b>164</b>)."
