He was a member of the assembly of emperor Harṣavardhana. ‘Harṣacarita’ (prose) is the most important work of Bāṇa. Though many of the descriptions in this book contain exaggerations it affords plenty of scope for investigation into the features of ancient Sanskrit literature. He has mentioned about Vyāsa, Bhaṭṭāra-hariścandra, Sātavāhana, Pravarasena, Bhāsa, Kālidāsa and such others. <dvsn n='NI'/>Harṣacarita, in a sense, is a Romance. It is divided into eight Ucchvāsas. From the first two or three chapters informations could be had of Bāṇabhaṭṭa. His mother Rājyadevī died when he was a little boy. At the age of fourteen his father also died. After that he arrived at the palace of Harṣa. The story of Harṣacarita begins with the death of Prabhākara-Vardhana, father of Harṣa. The Book ends with the story incomplete. Harṣacarita is the only historic prose work available in Sanskrit."

A mighty and powerful Asura. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Genealogy and birth.</i> Descended from Mahāviṣṇu in the following order: Brahmā-Marīci-Kaśyapa-Hiraṇyakaśipu-Pṛahlāda-Virocana-Mahābali-Bāṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Getting a boon.</i> Bāṇa began his reign with the city of Śoṇitapura as his capital. Then he went to the vicinity of the Himālayas and began to do penance thinking of Śiva. Śiva made his appearance and asked him what he wanted. He requested that he should be considered as the son of Pārvatī and that he should be given thousand hands so as to destroy all his enemies. Śiva granted him the boon. From that day onwards Pārvatī considered him as the younger brother of Subrahmaṇya. He returned to his Kingdom and began to reign. <dvsn n='NI'/>3) <i>Battle with Śrī Kṛṣṇa and his fall.</i> (See the word Aniruddha). <dvsn n='NI'/>4) <i>Other information.</i> (1) In the Purāṇas Bāṇāsura is often called by the name Mahākāla, which is the name of an attendant of Śiva. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza 20). <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) Śukrācārya (the teacher of the Asuras) always worked for the uplift of Bāṇa.

So once Subrahmaṇya had to cut the mountain Krauñca with his arrows. (M.B., Śalya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 82)."

During the regime of Śrī Rāma this Asura fought against the King and his brothers. A Śivaliṅga had been consecrated in the throat of this asura. So it was not possible for Lakṣmaṇa to defeat him though he had fought with him for so many days. Lakṣmaṇa heard an etherial voice saying, “Unless and until the image of Śivaliṅga is removed from his throat Bāṇa could not be killed.” By the operation of arrows Lakṣmaṇa smashed the image of Śivaliṅga in his throat. With the same arrow he cut the throat of the asura also and thus Bāṇa was killed. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa)."
