More curious however is <ls>Divy</ls> 〔326.9—11〕 eṣa eva devate sa (separate from the next) pṛṣṭhībhūto Maitrīyo yo vyāghryā ātmānaṃ parityajya catvāriṃśatkalpasaṃprasthito Maitreyo bodhisattva ekena śiraḥparityāgenāvapṛṣṭhīkṛtaḥ; here, if the text is correct, Maitrīya would seem to be the name of Maitreya in an earlier birth; but the passage is otherwise puzzling. On the basis of these two passages should we recognize Maitrīya as a real variant (like <b>Maitraka</b>, <ab>q.v.</ab>) for <b>Maitreya</b> (1)?"
