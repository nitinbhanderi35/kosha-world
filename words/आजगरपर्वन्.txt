In the eleventh year <is>Yudhiṣṭhira</is>, advised by Bhīma, took leave of those regions, determining again to practise austerities on the mountain, when he had regained his kingdom; and after <is>Lomaśa</is> had returned to the abode of the gods, they with the brahmans proceeded along that very road, carried by <is>Ghaṭotkaca</is> and his followers, and advised also by Ārṣṭiṣeṇa (III, <b>176</b>).—§ 449: Having crossed <is>Kailāsa</is>, they passed one night in the hermitage of king <is>Vṛṣaparvan</is> (<i>b</i>), then one month at <is>Badarī</is>, seeing Kubera's (<i>c</i>) favourite lake (<i>nalinīm</i>), then crossing the land of <is>Cīna, Tuṣāra, Darada</is>, and all the regions of <is>Kulinda</is>, and the difficult Himālaya regions, they reached the city of the <is>Kirāta</is> king <is>Subāhu</is>, where they met with their charioteers <is>Viśoka</is>, etc., and their servants <is>Mahendrasena</is>, etc., the cooks and servants of the kitchen. After having stayed there one night, they, dismissing Ghaṭotkaca and his followers, with the charioteers and chariots reached “the king of mountains” near <is>Yamunā</is> (<i>Yāmunam adrirājam</i>, i.e. <i>Yamunodgamam</i>, Nīl.; “name of a mountain,” BR.), where they dwelt for one year, occupied with hunting, in the forest <is>Viśākhayūpa</is>. There in a cavern Bhīma was seized by a snake and rescued by Yudhiṣṭhira. In the twelfth year of their exile they repaired thence to the borders of the desert, and desirous of dwelling by the <is>Sarasvatī</is> (<i>d</i>), they went there, and thence reached the lake of <is>Dvaitavana</is> (III, <b>177</b>).—§ 450: At the request of Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana detailed how Bhīma, when they had come from the rājarṣi Vṛṣaparvan's hermitage, was hunting with unpoisoned (<i>śuddhair</i>) arrows on some spots of <is>Himavat</is> (<i>b</i>), was seized by a huge snake, and on account of a boon that had been granted to the serpent was quite unable to extricate himself (III, <b>178</b>). The serpent said that he was the rājarṣi <is>Nahuṣa</is>, the son of <is>Āyu</is>, whom <is>Agastya</is> had cursed to become a serpent, out of compassion, however, adding to his curse that the person who would be able to answer his questions would deliver him, and that even stronger beings would, when seized by him, lose their strength. He had retained his recollection of his former existence, and nobody who came within his reach at the sixth division of the day (<i>? ṣaṣṭhe kāle: aṣṭadhā vibhaktasyāhno</i> <i>bhāge</i>, Nīl.) could escape him. Bhīma lamented. Now appeared dreadful omens to Yudhiṣṭhira there, and having learnt from Draupadī that Bhīma had long been out, he set out with Dhaumya, having directed <is>Arjuna</is> to protect Draupadī, and <is>Nakula</is> and <is>Sahadeva</is> to protect the brahmans; and in the east, following the tracks of Bhīma, he came to the spot (III, <b>179</b>). The serpent told Yudhiṣṭhira who he was, refused other food instead of Bhīma, but promised to deliver him if Yudhiṣṭhira could answer his questions. The first question was about the characteristics of the brahman, etc. (III, <b>180</b>). Yudhiṣṭhira asked the serpent some questions about the means of salvation, and some other moral and philosophical questions, about the difference between the mind (<i>manas</i>) and the intellect (<i>buddhi</i>), and what had caused Nahuṣa's fall. Nahuṣa told that in heaven he used to exact tribute from brahmarṣis, gods, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Pannagas, etc.; and that such was the spell of his eyes, that on whatever creature he fixed them he instantly destroyed its power; Agastya had foretold that Yudhiṣṭhira would save him from his curse. He delivered Bhīma unhurt, and, assuming his celestial shape, went back to heaven. Yudhiṣṭhira returned with Dhaumya and Bhīma, and narrated all that to the brahmans, who censured Bhīma, and warned him against attempting such things again (III, <b>181</b>)."
