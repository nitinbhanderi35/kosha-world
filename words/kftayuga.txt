(For the set up etc. of the Yugas see under Manvantara). <dvsn n='NI'/>In the first Yuga, i.e. Kṛta yuga, people will be quite righteous. As the Yugas change righteousness will fade out in increasing measure till the world will be filled with unrighteousness and evil by the time it is Kaliyuga. When Kaliyuga is completed Mahāviṣṇu will incarnate himself as Kalki and wipe out unrighteousness and establish Kṛtayuga once again."
