The journey to battle is Yāna. Āsana is, not going for war. Dvaidhībhāva is dividing his army into two, i.e. if the army rose against the King, he should bring one party on his side and make the two parties fight with each other. Saṃśraya is to yield to the powerful. (Manusmṛti, Chapter 7, Stanza 160)."
