To the couple were born two daughters called Anṛta (falsehood) and Nikṛta (fraud) and from them were born the daughters Bhayā (fear) Naraka (hell) Māyā (illusion) and Vedanā (pain). Māyā brought forth Mṛtyu (death), the annihilator of all living objects, and Vedanā, from Raurava (a particular hell) brought forth Duḥkha (sorrow, grief). From Mṛtyu were born Jāti (caste), Jarā (wrinkles), Śoka (sorrow), Tṛṣṇā (covetouseness) and Krodha (anger). (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19)."
