It is as follows. <dvsn n='NI'/>Videgha put Agni in his mouth and lived without talking, fearing that Agni might jump out. His priest Rahūgaṇa tried to the utmost, but he could not extricate fire from the mouth of the king. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once by chance the word Ghṛta got out of the mouth of Rahūgaṇa. Instantly the fire in the mouth of the king blazed into a big flame and burst out of the mouth. That fire gradually increased and began to consume the world, Rivers became dry. It seemed that even Videgha and his priest would be burnt to ashes in that blazing fire. At last Videgha got into the river Sadānīrā, which flowed through the boundary of his own kingdom, with the intention of not becoming a prey to the ever-increasing fire. With this the fire abated."
