Is this only a hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>, or does it give a clue to the real etymology of maheśākhya and <lang>Pali</lang> mahesakkha? <i>Having a very glorious name</i> fits the word at least as well, and is in my opinion at least as plausible etymologically, as the traditional (but rather mechanical) analysis mahā plus īśa plus ākhyā."
