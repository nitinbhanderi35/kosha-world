Dama, a famous King of Diṣṭa dynasty carried away by stealth Sumanā, the daughter of Cāruvarmā, the King of Daśārṇa, in consequence of which Vapuṣmān and Dama became enemies. <dvsn n='NI'/>Vapuṣmān waited for an opportunity to take revenge and when a convenient moment came, he killed Nariṣyanta the father of Dama. Indrasenā the mother of Dama told him of his father's murder and then jumping into the funeral pyre of her husband, she died. Because of grief at the loss of his parents and anger towards the slayer, Dama started with a mighty army and engaged Vapuṣmān in a fierce battle. He killed Vapuṣmān in the battle and with his blood he made offerings to the spirits of his parents. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, 133)."
