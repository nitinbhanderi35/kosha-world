            "content": "TĀRĀ I¦. Wife of Bāli, best of Vānaras (monkeys). There are two stories different from each other regarding the birth of Tārā. One version is that Tārā was born during the churning of the Milk-Ocean. Airāvata, Uccaiśśravas, Kalpavṛkṣa, Cintāmaṇi, Kaustubha, Candra, Apsarases, Mahālakṣmī Tārā and Rumā rose from the sea of Milk. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa). The second version is that Tārā was the daughter of Suṣeṇa. Bāli at the time of his death is said to have spoken thus of his wife Tārā “Tārā, daughter of Suṣeṇa, is well learned and is capable of assessing a situation and suggesting the correct thing to be done at that time. If she says a thing is good, it is never otherwise.” (Chapter 22, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). From this it can be understood that Tārā was the daughter of Suṣeṇa and we get an idea of the character of Tārā also from this. (See under Bāli)."

            "content": "TĀRĀ II¦. Wife of Bṛhaspati. She was extremely beautiful. Once she fell in love with Candra (Moon) and leaving her husband started living with him. Candra was the disciple of Bṛhaspati. The devas were angry when they found the wife of their preceptor staying with a disciple of his. Bṛhaspati sent word to her to return home but she did not heed. At last the Devas decided to fight against Candra. Then they came to a compromise and Tārā was sent back to Bṛhaspati. In due course Tārā delivered a son. He was Budha, father of Purūravas. There arose then a dispute between Candra and Bṛhaspati regarding the fatherhood of the child. Then the Devas called Tārā and asked her to name the child's father. Tārā said that the child was of Candra and so Budha was looked after at the house of Candra. (9th Skandha, Bhāgavata)."
