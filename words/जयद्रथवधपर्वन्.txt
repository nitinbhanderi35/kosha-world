At the command of <i>Duryodhana</i> the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> rallying, with a number of <i>Śakas</i>, etc. (εε) (headed by <i>Duryodhana</i>), attacked <i>Sātyaki; Duḥśāsana</i> (with a large force of robbers) & <i>Sātyaki</i>; many elephants of the race of <i>Añjana</i>, etc. (ζζ), were slain, and many steeds of the <i>Vanāyu</i> race, etc. (ηη), and many thousands of warriors; many <i>Daradas & Sātyaki</i>; they fled away. <i>Droṇa</i>, hearing the noise, told his charioteer to take the chariot to the spot where <i>Yuyudhāna</i> was; the charioteer remarked that the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were rushing against <i>Droṇa</i>; suddenly <i>Sātyaki</i> appeared, and the broken troops and <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, all struck with panic, rushed towards <i>Droṇa's</i> division (VII, <b>121</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> rebuked <i>Duḥśāsana</i> for his cowardice (quoting his words to <i>Draupadī</i>), and told him to make peace with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (θθ). <i>Duḥśāsana</i> (with <i>Mlecchas</i>) & <i>Sātyaki.

While <i>Sātyaki</i> was proceeding towards <i>Arjuna</i> he was again attacked by <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, who was taken up by the <i>Trigarta</i> leader on his chariot; <i>Sātyaki</i> did not slay him, recollecting the words of <i>Bhīmasena</i>, but quickly proceeded along the track of <i>Arjuna</i> (VII, <b>123</b>).
