Mokṣadharma). § 659: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the duties in the four stages of life; <i>Bhīṣma</i> indicated the attainment of emancipation as the highest of all duties. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Bhīṣma</i> how grief might be overcome; <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old story of the conversation between a <i>brahman</i> and king <i>Senajit</i>, burning with sorrow on account of the death of his son; dissociation from the world is the grand method of overcoming grief. The <i>brahman</i> cited the verses sung by <i>Piṅgalā</i> (a fallen woman who was denied the company of her lover through an accident) about the manner in which she had acquired eternal merit; freedom from hope and desire is felicity. King <i>Senajit</i> experienced delight and became very happy (XII, <b>174</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired of <i>Bhīṣma</i> as to what constitutes the highest good that man should seek in view of the transient character of time; <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of a discourse between a <i>brahman</i>, who was devoted to the study of the <i>Vedas</i>, and his son <i>Medhāvin</i>, who was well conversant with the religion of emancipation, and acquainted also with the affairs of the world, on the uncertainty of life and the mutability of all things save <i>Bráhman</i> (XII, <b>175</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked how happiness and misery come to the rich and the poor; <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of what was sung by <i>Śampāka</i>; who had achieved emancipation, told in former times by a poor <i>brahman</i> rendered miserable by a bad wife, etc.; the faults of prosperity; in renunciation is the highest good of men (XII, <b>176</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked what a man must do to find happiness if he be poor. <i>Bhīṣma</i> explained who is a happy man, and related the old narrative of what <i>Maṅki</i> had sung when freed from attachments; <i>Maṅki</i> found that he was assiduously doomed to disappointments; at last, with a remnant of his property, he purchased a couple of young bulls with a yoke; a camel ran away with them upon its neck; <i>Maṅki's</i> observations, quoting <i>Śuka</i>: desire is fraught with sorrow (XII, <b>177</b>). In this connection reference is made to the old verses sung by the <i>Videha</i> king <i>Janaka</i>, who had attained to tranquillity of soul: “even if the whole of <i>Mithilā</i> be consumed in a conflagration I shall incur no loss.” Discourse between king <i>Nāhuṣa</i> (i.e. Yayāti) and Ṛ. <i>Bodhya</i> about freedom from attachment; <i>Bodhya's</i> six preceptors (<i>Piṅgalā</i>, etc.) (XII, <b>178</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to know by what conduct a person may succeed in this world and attain to an excellent end. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old story of the discourse between king <i>Prahlāda</i> and a sage who had adopted the <i>Ājagara</i> vow: the indifference of the latter to all worldly objects in view of the inevitability of death (XII, <b>179</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked which of these, viz. kinsmen, or acts, or wealth, or wisdom, should be the refuge of man. <i>Bhīṣma</i> answered that wisdom should be the refuge, instancing <i>Bali</i>, etc. (α), and related the old story of the discourse between <i>Indra</i> and <i>Kāśyapa</i>, a Ṛ.'s son, who was brought to the ground by a <i>vaiśya</i> negligently driving his chariot, and who in despair resolved to end his life; <i>Indra</i> appeared to him in the form of a jackal and proved to him the superiority of his status as a human being and a brahman; not to yield to the instigation of the senses constitutes happiness; “thou dost not regret (<i>smārasi</i>) wine (<i>Vāruṇī</i>) nor the <i>latvāka</i> fowls; there is no drink and no food more delicious than these;…the vilest <i>Pukkasa</i> or <i>Cāṇḍāla</i> never wishes to give up his life.” <i>Kāśyapa</i> gave up the desire of ending his life; he knew the jackal to be <i>Indra</i>, worshipped him, and returned home (XII, <b>180</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked whether gifts, sacrifices, penances, and dutiful services to preceptors are productive of merit. <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on righteousness and sin and their respective consequences on life (XII, <b>181</b>).—§ 660: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about him who has created the universe and to whom it returns when dissolution comes. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of the sacred words that M.-ṛ. <i>Bhṛgu</i> uttered in reply to the questions of <i>Bharadvāja</i>, on the <i>Kailāsa</i> summit, explaining to him the cosmogony, i.e. <i>Bhṛgu-Bharadvāja-saṃvāda(b</i>) (XII, <b>182—192</b>).—§ 661: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Bhīṣma</i> about the ordinances about conduct. <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on the characteristics of the wicked and the good (“<i>Sūrya</i> should always be worshipped,” etc.), and the duties that all men should practise, quoting D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>; “one who has abstained from meat should not take meat even if it be sanctified with <i>mantras</i> from the <i>Yajurveda</i>” (XII, <b>193</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on <i>adhyātma</i>; the nature of the three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness; the distinction between matter (<i>sattva</i>) and soul (<i>kṣetrajña</i>); the highest end to be obtained is emancipation (XII, <b>194</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on the four kinds of <i>yoga</i>; “M.-ṛ., obtaining a knowledge of the same, attain to eternal success (<i>siddhiṃ</i>) even here” (XII, <b>195</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired after the fruits of the silent recitation of sacred <i>mantras; Bhīṣma</i> wanted to recite the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Yama</i>, a <i>brahman</i>, and Time (v. <i>infra</i>, ch. <b>199</b>); on <i>Sāṅkhya</i>, “otherwise called the <i>Vedānta</i>,” and <i>Yoga, Bráhman</i>, etc. (XII, <b>196</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the other aims of silent reciters; <i>Bhīṣma</i> indicated the different aims realized by different kinds of reciters (XII, <b>197</b>); the nature of the hell into which reciters may sink; the regions of Lp., etc. (α), are hells compared to the region of the Supreme Soul, i.e. to emancipation (XII, <b>198</b>).—§ 662: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> wished to hear in full the dispute between Time, <i>Mṛtyu</i>, <i>Yama, Sūrya's</i> son <i>Ikṣvāku</i>, and a <i>brahman</i>, referred to above (v. ch. <b>196</b>); <i>Bhīṣma</i> related this old story, i.e. <i>Jāpakopākhyāna(b</i>) (XII, <b>199—200</b>).—§ 663: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the results of the <i>yoga</i> of knowledge, of all the <i>Vedas</i>, and of observances and vows; <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old discourse between <i>Manu Prajāpati</i> and his disciple M.-ṛ. <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (the foremost of D.ṛ.), in days of old, who had studied the <i>Ṛcs</i>, etc. (α); <i>Bṛhaspati</i> asked how an embodied being departs from one body and attains to another; acts result from the desire of obtaining happiness and avoiding misery; the efforts for the acquisition of knowledge arise from the desire of avoiding both happiness and misery; it is by avoiding acts that one succeeds in entering into <i>Bráhman</i>; the nature of <i>Bráhman</i> (XII, <b>201</b>); continuation of <i>Manu's</i> discourse on the nature of emancipation and the soul; the soul takes its character from the body; how the soul leaving one body enters into another (XII, <b>202</b>); though invisible, the soul exists (XII, <b>203</b>); continuation of <i>Manu's</i> discourse, explaining how the soul may be seen (XII, <b>204</b>); continuation of <i>Manu's</i> discourse, explaining how grief may be avoided; how <i>Bráhman</i> may be attained (XII, <b>205</b>); abstention from acts is the highest religion (XII, <b>206</b>).— § 664: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Bhīṣma</i> about the nature of the Supreme Deity (<i>Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa</i>, etc. (α)). <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse, which he had heard from <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>, etc. (β), on the nature of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> or <i>Govinda</i>, etc. (γ); the <i>Asura Madhu (b); Brahmán's</i> seven will-born sons (δ), etc. (ε). <i>Madhusūdana (Kṛṣṇa</i>) created day and night, etc. (ζ); then from his mouth he created 100 <i>brahmans</i>, from his arms 100 <i>kṣatriyas</i>, from his thighs 100 <i>vaiśyas</i>, and from his feet 100 <i>śūdras</i>, and then he made <i>Dhātṛ</i> (i.e. <i>Brahmán</i>, PCR.) the lord and ruler of all created beings; <i>Brahmán</i> also became the expositor of the knowledge of the <i>Vedas; Virūpākṣa</i> he made the ruler of the spirits and ghosts and <i>Mātṛs; Yama</i> the ruler of P. [and] all sinful men; <i>Kubera</i> the lord of all treasures; <i>Varuṇa</i> the lord of the waters and of all aquatic animals; <i>Indra</i> the lord of the gods. In those times men lived as long as they chose, without any fear of <i>Yama</i>; offspring was begotten by a fiat of the will. In the <i>Tretā</i> age children were begotten by touch alone. In the <i>Dvāpara</i> age sexual intercourse originated. In the <i>Kali</i> age men have come to marry and live in pairs. The sinful creatures of the earth, born in the southern region and called <i>Andhrakas</i>, etc. (η); in the northern region, the <i>Yaunas</i>, etc. (θ); their practices are similar to those of <i>Cāṇḍālas</i> and ravens and vultures; in the <i>Kṛta</i> age they were nowhere on earth; it is from the <i>Tretā</i> that they have had their origin; when the terrible interval [between the <i>Tretā</i> and the <i>Dvāpara</i>] came, the <i>kṣatriyas</i> engaged in battle. D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i>, that observer of all the worlds, has said that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> is the supreme god (XII, <b>207</b>).—§ 665: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked who are the first <i>Prajāpatis</i>, and who the great <i>Ṛṣis</i>, and in which direction they dwell. <i>Bhīṣma</i> enumerated <i>Brahmán's</i> seven sons (α), mentioned in the <i>Purāṇas</i> as seven <i>Brahmáns</i>. The <i>Prajāpatis</i> that came after these are: (<i>a</i>) in <i>Atri's</i> race: <i>Prācīnabarhis (Brahmayoniḥ sanātanaḥ</i>) > the ten <i>Prācetasaḥ ></i> <i>Prajāpati Dakṣa</i> or <i>Ka; (b) Marīci</i> had one son <i>Kaśyapa</i> or <i>Ariṣṭanemi. Atri</i> had another son born of his loins, the handsome and princely <i>Soma</i>; he performed penances for 1,000 celestial <i>yugas. Aryaman</i> and his sons were rulers and creators of all creatures. <i>Śaśabindu</i> had 10,000 wives, and begot upon each of them 1,000 sons, who would call none <i>Prajāpati</i> save themselves; the ancient (<i>purāṇāḥ</i>) brahmans call creatures (<i>prajāṃ) Śāśabindavī</i>; this race became the progenitor of the <i>Vṛṣṇi</i> race. “These that I have named are the illustrious <i>Prajāpatis</i>.” The deities are: the twelve <i>Ādityas</i> (all sprung from <i>Kaśyapa</i>) (β); the <i>Aśvins</i> (γ) (the sons of <i>Mārtaṇḍa—aṣṭamasya</i>); these were first called the gods and the two classes of Pitṛs (<i>? te ca</i> <i>pūrvaṃ surāś ceti dvividhāḥ pitaraḥ smṛtāḥ). Tvaṣṭṛ's</i> son was the handsome <i>Viśvarūpa; Ajaikapād</i>, etc. (δ) [are the eleven <i>Rudras</i>]; these were reckoned as gods at the time of the <i>Prajāpati Manu</i>; the <i>Siddhas</i> and <i>Sādhyas</i>, different as to perfect conduct and youth; the <i>Ṛbhus</i> and the <i>Maruts</i> were also classes of gods (C. <i>devānāṃ cādito gaṇāḥ</i>; B. <i>codito gaṇaḥ</i>); thus are enumerated the <i>Viśvedevās</i> and the <i>Aśvins</i>. Amongst them the <i>Ādityas</i> are <i>kṣatriyas</i>, the <i>Maruts vaiśyas</i>, the <i>Aśvins</i> (engaged in penances) <i>śūdras</i>; the gods [called] <i>Aṅgirasaḥ</i> are <i>brahmans</i>. The person who at morn recites the names of these deities becomes cleansed of all his sins. <i>Yavakrīta</i>, etc. (ε), and <i>Kaṇva</i>, etc. (ζ), all reside in the east; <i>Unmuca</i>, etc. (η), in the south; <i>Uṣaṅgu</i>, etc. (θ), in the west; <i>Ātreya</i>, etc. (ι), in the north. These are the witnesses [of the universe] and the creators of all the worlds. By reciting these names one is cleansed of all one's sins; by sojourning to these points a person becomes cleansed of all his sins and succeeds in returning home in safety (XII, <b>208</b>).—§ 666: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the reason of <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> assuming the form of an animal. <i>Bhīṣma</i> said that formerly, while hunting, he arrived at the hermitage of <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i>, where he was honoured by Ṛ., and M.-ṛ. <i>Kaśyapa</i> related: In former days Dā. and As. <i>Naraka</i>, etc., oppressed D. and D.-ṛ.; the earth seemed to be oppressed with a heavy weight. The <i>Ādityas</i> repaired to <i>Brahmán</i>, who said that <i>Viṣṇu</i> in the form of a boar would slay the As. Some time afterwards <i>Viṣṇu</i> (having <i>yoga</i> for his soul, etc.) penetrated into the earth (into <i>Rasātala</i>) in the form of a boar, and uttering tremendous roars (<i>nādena</i>), at which even D. with <i>Indra</i> became terror-stricken, pierced the As. with his hoofs, etc., whence he came to be called <i>Sanātana. Brahmán</i> explained to the gods that he was <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, the Creator of all things, the foremost of <i>yogins</i>, etc., he from whose navel the primeval lotus had sprung, etc. (XII, <b>209</b>).—§ 667: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the nature of that high <i>yoga</i> by which emancipation may be attained. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of a discourse between a preceptor (the foremost of Ṛ.) and his disciple on emancipation; on <i>adhyātma</i> (undisclosed in the very <i>Vedas</i>); <i>Vāsudeva</i> is the supreme [cause] of the universe; he is the origin of the <i>Vedas (viśvasya brahmaṇo mukhaṃ</i>), etc.; he created P., D., Ṛ., Y., Rā., N., As., and men, etc.; having reduced everything into non-existence, he once more, in the beginning of a <i>yuga</i>, creates <i>Prakṛti</i>; at the end of every <i>yuga</i> the <i>Vedas</i> and all other scriptures disappear; in consequence of the grace of <i>Svayambhū</i>, M.-ṛ., through their penances, first re-acquire the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Itihāsas; Svayambhū</i> knows the <i>Vedas, Bṛhaspati</i> their <i>Aṅgas, Bhārgava</i> (i.e. Śukra) the <i>Nītiśāstra</i> (science of morality, etc.), <i>Nārada</i> the <i>Gāndharva</i> (the science of music), <i>Bharadvāja</i> the science of arms (<i>Dhanurgrahaṃ), Gārgya</i> the history of the celestial Ṛṣis (<i>devarṣicaritaṃ), Kṛṣṇātreya</i> medicine, diverse other teachers the philosophical systems (<i>Nyāyatantrāṇi</i>, cf. Nīl.). Neither D. nor Ṛ. were [originally] able to apprehend <i>Bráhman</i>; only <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> knew it; from him Ṛ., the foremost D., As., and R.-ṛ. of old learnt it. Etymology of <i>Puruṣa (navadvāraṃ</i> <i>puraṃ vyāpya śete</i>, v. 7679) (XII, <b>210</b>). Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse explaining how the inclinations and instincts of a past life run towards the soul in a new life (XII, <b>211</b>). Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on abstention from acts and the nature of knowledge. Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on the faults that should be got rid of in order to attain to emancipation (XII, <b>212</b>). Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse (XII, <b>213</b>). <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on the means of conquering the senses (XII, <b>214</b>). <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on the consequences of attachment to the objects of the senses (XII, <b>215</b>). <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on the nature and causes of dreams. Darkness has been adopted by the <i>Asuras, Bráhman</i> is difficult of attainment by either the gods or the <i>Asuras</i>; goodness, passion, and darkness belong to the deities and the <i>Asuras</i>; goodness is the attribute of the deities, while the two others belong to the <i>Asuras; Bráhman</i> transcends all those attributes; it is pure knowledge, and is obtainable only by withdrawing the mind and the senses from all external objects (XII, <b>216</b>). Who may be said to know <i>Bráhman</i>; the distinction between <i>pravṛtti</i> and <i>nivṛtti</i>; the respective nature of <i>prakṛti</i> and <i>puruṣa</i>; the nature and consequences of <i>yoga</i> (XII, <b>217</b>). —§ 668: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the conduct by which <i>Janaka</i> the king of Mithilā attained to emancipation. <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the old narrative of the conversation between <i>Pañcaśikha</i> and <i>Janaka</i> of Mithilā, i.e. <i><is>Pañcaśikha-</is></i> <i><is>vākya</is></i> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>218—219</b>).—§ 669: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked what leads to happiness and what to misery and what to freedom from fear; <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on self-restraint (XII, <b>220</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> question about the merits of subsisting upon the remnants of sacrifices, and whether fasting be really a penance (<i>tapas); Bhīṣma</i> explained that though fasting is generally regarded as a penance, it is not so in reality, being rather an impediment to the acquisition of the knowledge of soul; living upon sacrificial remnants is regarded as fasting of the highest merit (XII, <b>221</b>).— § 670: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked whether man should be regarded as the real doer of acts. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of a discourse between the <i>Daitya</i> king <i>Prahlāda</i>, who was unattached to worldly objects, etc., and <i>Indra</i>, who questioned <i>Prahlāda</i> about the best means by which knowledge of the soul can be attained, etc., and was instructed by him. <i>Indra</i> became filled with wonder, and, having worshipped the <i>Daitya</i> king, proceeded to his own abode (XII, <b>222</b>).—§ 671: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the kind of intelligence by adopting which a king deprived of kingdom and prosperity may still live on earth. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Indra</i> and <i>Virocana's</i> son <i>Bali</i>, i.e. <is>Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>223—225</b>).—§ 672: <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Indra</i> and the <i>Asura Namuci</i>, i.e. <is>Śakra-Namuci-saṃvāda</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>226</b>).—§ 673: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked as to what is good for a man sunk into dire distress. <i>Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on fortitude, quoting the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Bali</i> and <i>Vāsava</i> (Indra), i.e. <is>Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>227</b>).— § 674: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the indications of future greatness and future fall. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old story of the discourse between <i>Śrī</i> and <i>Śakra</i>, i.e. <is>Śrī-Vāsava-</is> <is>saṃvāda</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>229</b>).—§ 675: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the practices that lead to the attainment of <i>Bráhman</i>. <i>Bhīṣma</i> said that one engaged in the religion of <i>nivṛtti</i>, etc., can attain to <i>Bráhman</i>, quoting the old narrative of the discourse between the wise <i>Jaigīṣavya</i> and <i>Asita Devala</i>, who was instructed by <i>Jaigīṣavya</i> to behave indifferently towards praise and blame, etc., “D., G., Pś., and Rā. cannot reach the rank which is his who has attained to the highest end” (XII, <b>230</b>).—§ 676: Requested by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> about the man that is dear to all, <i>Bhīṣma</i> quoted the words that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, asked by <i>Ugrasena</i>, said to him on a former occasion on the subject of D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada's</i> qualifications (XII, <b>231</b>).—§ 677: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the origin and the end of all creatures, the nature of their thoughts and acts, of the divisions of time, and of the allotted periods of life in the respective epochs or <i>yugas</i>; having heard the discourse of <i>Bhṛgu</i> to B.-ṛ. <i>Bharadvāja</i>, he had become attached to <i>yoga. Bhīṣma</i> recited the old narrative of what the divine <i>Vyāsa</i> said to his son <i>Śuka</i> (who had studied the <i>Vedas</i> with all their branches, and the <i>Upaniṣads</i>, and was desirous of leading the life of <i>brahmacarya</i>) about these very questions. <i>Vyāsa</i> said: Only <i>Bráhman</i> is without beginning and without end. Ṛ. have measured time thus: 15 winks of the eye = 1 <i>kāṣṭhā</i>; 30 <i>kāṣṭhās</i> = 1 <i>kalā</i>; 30(1/10) <i>kalās</i> = 1 <i>muhūrta</i>; 30 <i>muhūrtas</i> = 1 day and night; 30 days and nights = 1 month (= 1 day and night of the <i>Pitṛs</i>, the lighted fortnight being their day and the dark fortnight their night); 12 months = 2 <i>ayanas</i> = 1 year = 1 day and night of the gods (<i>udagayana</i>, i.e. from winter solstice to summer solstice = the day; <i>dakṣiṇāyana</i>, i.e. from the latter to the former = the night). Moreover, there are the day and night of <i>Brahmán</i> and his years also. Of the <i>Kṛta-yuga</i> the duration is 4,000 [celestial] years, with a morning (<i>sandhyā</i>) of 400 years and an evening (<i>sandhyāṃśa</i>) of 400; the other <i>yugas</i> gradually decrease by a quarter. In the <i>Kṛta</i> age all duties exist in their entirety, and all live for 400 years (free from disease, etc.); in the other <i>yugas</i> duty, etc., decrease by a quarter. The duties for the several <i>yugas</i> are different. In <i>Kṛta</i> penance is foremost, in <i>Tretā</i> knowledge, in <i>Dvāpara</i> sacrifice, in <i>Kali</i> gift. These 12,000 [celestial!] years constitute a <i>yuga</i>; 1,000 <i>yugas</i> = 1 day of <i>Brahmán</i> (when the universe starts into life) = 1 night of <i>Brahmán</i> (= universal dissolution, the Creator being asleep, having taken recourse to <i>yoga</i>, meditation). <i>Brahmán</i>, waking up, modifies the indestructible <i>Bráhman</i>, etc. (XII, <b>232</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> explained the creation, etc. (XII, <b>233</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> told how the <i>Supreme Lord</i> merges everything into his soul (XII, <b>234</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> discoursed on the duties of a brahman; “they that are good deserve to have even <i>Uccaiḥśravas”; Satyasandha</i>, having offered his life to save a brahman, ascended to heaven; likewise <i>Saṅkṛti's</i> son <i>Rantideva</i>, having given tepid water to <i>Vasiṣṭha; Ātreya</i> <i>Indradamána</i>, having given wealth to a deserving person; <i>Śibi Auśīnara</i>, having given his limbs and son for the sake of a brahman; the <i>Kāśi</i> king <i>Pratardana</i>, having given his eyes to a brahman; king <i>Devāvṛdha</i>, having given a costly umbrella (with all the people of his kingdom); <i>Sāṅkṛti Ātreya</i>, having given instructions to his disciples on <i>Bráhman; Ambarīṣa</i>, having given eleven <i>arbudas</i> of kine to the brahmans (with all the people of his kingdom); <i>Sāvitrī</i> [i.e. Sāvitra = Karṇa, cf. XIII, 6253], by giving away the ear-rings; <i>Janamejaya</i>, by giving away his own body; <i>Yuvanāśva Vṛṣādarbhi</i>, by giving gems, a mansion, and beautiful women; the <i>Videha</i> king <i>Nimi</i> gave away his kingdom, <i>Jāmadagnya (Paraśu-Rāma</i>) the whole earth, <i>Gaya</i> the earth with her towns (to the brahmans); <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, when the clouds ceased to pour rain, kept alive all creatures; <i>Karandhama's</i> son <i>Maruta</i>, by giving away his daughter to <i>Aṅgiras</i>, ascended to heaven; king <i>Brahmadatta Pāñcālya</i>, by giving the jewel <i>Śaṅkha</i> (to brahmans); king <i>Mitrasaha</i>, by giving his dear wife <i>Madayantī</i> to <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> (with that wife of his); R.-r. <i>Sahasrajit</i>, having given his life for the sake of a brahman; king <i>Śatadyumna</i>, having given to <i>Mudgala</i> a house made of gold, etc.; the <i>Śālva</i> king <i>Dyutimat</i>, having given unto <i>Ṛcīka</i> his kingdom; R.-ṛ. <i>Lomapāda</i>, having given his daughter <i>Śāntā</i> to <i>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga</i> (obtained all his wishes); R.-ṛ. <i>Madirāśva</i>, by giving his daughter to <i>Hiraṇyahasta</i>; king <i>Prasenajit</i>, by giving 100,000 cows with calves; etc. (XII, <b>235</b>). Continuation of <i>Vyāsa's</i> discourse on the duties of a brahman: the knowledge that should be acquired (α); knowledge is necessary for emancipation (XII, <b>236</b>). The different stages of a <i>yogin's</i> progress (XII, <b>237</b>). Asked by <i>Śuka</i>, <i>Vyāsa</i> discoursed on the character of that knowledge which leads to emancipation (XII, <b>238</b>). <i>Vyāsa's</i> discourse on whether acts are obligatory or optional; “the men of the <i>Tretā, Dvāpara</i>, and <i>Kali yugas</i> are inspired with doubts; the men of the <i>Kṛta yuga</i> are devoted to penances, etc. In the beginning of the <i>Tretā</i>, the <i>Vedas</i> and sacrifices and the divisions of caste and the several modes of life exist in their entirety; in consequence, however, of the duration of life having decreased in <i>Dvāpara</i>, all these things likewise decline; in the <i>Dvāpara</i> age, and even in the <i>Kali</i>, the <i>Vedas</i> are overtaken with perplexity; towards the close of the <i>Kali</i> again it is doubtful if they ever become even visible to the eye” (XII, <b>239</b>). Asked by <i>Śuka, Vyāsa</i> discoursed on the import of those duties that lead to emancipation; “in the feet [of living creatures] is <i>Viṣṇu</i>; in their arms <i>Indra</i>; within the stomach <i>Agni</i>; in the ears are the quarters; in the tongue is speech which is <i>Sarasvatī</i>”; success cannot be attained to without knowledge, penances, subjugation of the senses, and renunciation; the doctrine of knowledge as expounded in the <i>Sāṅkhya</i> system (XII, <b>240</b>).

Bhīṣma</i> recited the story of <i>Anukampaka</i> (<i>b</i>) with <is>Mṛtyu-Prajāpati-saṃvāda</is> (<i>c</i>) (XII, <b>257-</b> <b>259</b>).—§ 679: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked what is righteousness and whether righteousness is for this world or for the next or for both. <i>Bhīṣma's</i> answer: the practices of the good, the <i>Smṛtis</i>, and the <i>Vedas</i>, etc., according to Ṛ. of old (XII, <b>260</b>). Continuation (XII, <b>261</b>).—§ 680: Inquired of by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> about righteousness (XII, <b>262</b>) <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of the conversation of <i>Tulādhāra</i> with <i>Jājali</i> on the topic of righteousness, i.e. <is>Tulādhāra-</is> <is>Jājali-saṃvāda</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>263—265</b>).—§ 681: <i>Bhīṣma</i> related an old narrative of what was recited by king <i>Vicakhyu</i> (B. <i>°khn°</i>) through compassion for all creatures, in condemnation of animal slaughter when he saw the mangled body of a bull and heard the painful groans of the kine in a cow sacrifice, and observed the cruel brahmans gathered there to assist at the ceremonies. “<i>Manu</i> has applauded harmlessness in all acts…The true brahmans realize the presence of <i>Viṣṇu</i> in every sacrifice.” Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> said that one should acquire merit and act in such a way that one's body may not languish and suffer pain, and that death may not come (XII, <b>266</b>).—§ 682: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked whether one should act speedily or with delay. <i>Bhīṣma</i> told the old story of what occurred with respect to the wise <i>Cirakārin</i>, the son of <i>Medhātithi Gautama</i> of the race of <i>Aṅgiras</i> (<i>Āṅgirase kule</i>), who came to be called thus because he used to reflect long upon all matters, etc., and was regarded as an idle and foolish person. Once M.-ṛ. <i>Gautama</i> (the foremost of practisers of <i>yoga</i>), witnessing an act of grave misconduct in his wife <i>Ahalyā</i>, in wrath commanded <i>Cirakārin</i> to slay her, and then departed for the woods. <i>Cirakārin</i> began to think for a long while (description), remembering that the father is the performer of <i>garbhādhāna</i> and <i>sīmantonnayana</i>, etc., and that the mother is the son's <i>dhātrī</i>, etc. (etymology of several names of the mother and of the father), etc.; he thought that his mother was not to blame, as <i>Indra</i> had come to her in the form of her husband, etc. When many days had expired <i>Gautama</i> returned, shedding tears of repentance and thinking that the fault committed was due to his own carelessness (etymology of two names of the wife), and now became filled with great joy, and from that time, dwelling in his hermitage, did not live separately from his spouse or his son. He said: “Blessed be thou, O <i>Cirakārika!</i> do thou always reflect long before acting,” uttering some verses upon the merits of reflecting long. <i>Gautama</i> at last ascended to heaven with his son (XII, <b>267</b>).—§ 683: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked how a king should protect his subjects without injuring anybody. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of the conversation between <i>Dyumatsena</i> and his son king <i>Satyavat</i>, and the words spoken by the latter in behalf of some individuals who had been brought out for execution at the command of his father (“the killing of individuals can never be a righteous act”), quoting the instructions he had received from their grandsires of olden days, as to how kings should rule their subjects in the different ages (α); “when the <i>Kali</i> age sets in…fifteen parts of even that one-fourth of righteousness disappear, one-sixteenth thereof being all that then remains of it,” and quoting <i>Manu</i> <i>Svāyambhuva</i> (XII, <b>268</b>).—§ 684: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the relative superiority of domestic life and <i>yoga</i>. <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the old narrative of the discourse between the <i>Yati Kapila</i> and <i>Syūmaraśmi</i> on animal sacrifices, the obligatory character of acts, and the merits of <i>yoga</i> and renunciation. In days of old when <i>Tcaṣtṛ</i> came to king <i>Nahuṣa</i>, the latter was on the point of killing a cow in order to show him hospitality; <i>Kapila</i> said, “Alas! ye <i>Vedas</i>”; Ṛ. <i>Syūmaraśmi</i>, entering the cow, blamed this saying of <i>Kapila</i>, etc. (XII, <b>269</b>); the three classes of <i>Pitṛs</i> (α), etc. (XII, <b>270</b>). Continuation (XII, <b>271</b>).—§ 685: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked which among the three, viz. religion, profit, and pleasure, is superior. <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the ancient narrative of the benefit that the cloud <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i> (not yet adored by other men) in days of old had conferred upon a poor brahman that was devoted to him, and who had failed to obtain wealth by worshipping the gods. The brahman worshipped the cloud with <i>dhūpas</i>, etc.; the cloud became pleased and said to the brahman that the wise have ordained expiation for brahmanicide, drinking spirits, stealing, etc., but not for one that is ungrateful; “Expectation has a child named Iniquity, Wrath is a child of Envy, Cupidity of Deceit, Ingratitude is barren.” After that the brahman, on a bed of <i>kuśa</i>-grass and penetrated with the energy of <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i>, beheld all living beings in a dream, and <i>Maṇibhadra</i> in the midst of the gods employed in giving his orders; the gods were engaged in bestowing kingdoms, etc., upon men, etc.; <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i> prostrated himself before the gods in the presence of all Y. and prayed for some favour in behalf of the brahman; <i>Maṇibhadra</i> first offered to give him wealth, but was prevailed upon by <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i> to give virtue alone. The brahman became disgusted with the world and entered the woods and practised severe penances (description), and his mind was firmly set upon virtue; his strength did not diminish, and after a long time he acquired spiritual vision, etc. <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i> then paid him a visit and caused him to see the end that is attained by kings; he beheld thousands of kings sunk in hell, and many living in this world embracing lust and wrath, etc. <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i> said: “With these [vices] all human beings are enchained; the gods are afraid of men; these vices, at the command of the gods, mar and disconcert on every side; no man can become virtuous unless permitted by the gods…” The brahman confessed that he had not appreciated <i>Kuṇḍadhāra's</i> favour as he ought to do; <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i> forgave him and disappeared. The brahman roamed through all the worlds, having attained to ascetic success (<i>siddhiṃ</i>) through the grace of <i>Kuṇḍadhāra</i>. D., <i>brahmans</i>, Y., good men, and Cā. always adore only the virtuous (XII, <b>272</b>).—§ 686: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked what that sacrifice is which is ordained for the sake of virtue alone and not for the acquisition of heaven or wealth. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the history, formerly recited by <i>Nārada</i>, of a brahman named <i>Satya</i>, who in order to perform sacrifices lived according to the <i>uñcha</i> vow (description); his wife <i>Puṣkaradhāriṇī</i> did not approve of his conduct (i.e. his cruel sacrifices), but at his command she (clad in plumes of peacocks) joined a sacrifice where he was the <i>hotṛ</i>. His neighbour the virtuous <i>Parṇāda</i> at the command of <i>Śukra</i> (or, according to a various reading, of <i>Śukra's</i> race, so B., the text of C. is in disorder) addressed him in the shape of a deer, telling him to slay him and sacrifice with him, and <i>Sāvitrī</i> also told him to do so, but in vain; <i>Sāvitrī</i> then entered the sacrificial fire; but the deer (who was <i>Dharma</i>), causing the brahman through spiritual vision to behold Aps. and G., at first made him desire to slay the deer (at which his <i>tapas</i> diminished greatly), but then won him over to the <i>ahiṃsā</i> religion, and himself assisted him in his sacrifice; “the injury of living creatures forms no part of sacrifice (leading only to heaven)” (XII, <b>273</b>).—§ 687: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about how one becomes sinful, or virtuous, by what one attains to renunciation, and by what one wins emancipation, whereafter he was instructed by <i>Bhīṣma</i> (XII, <b>274</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> expounded the means for attaining to emancipation (XII, <b>275</b>).—§ 688: Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse, quoting the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Asita Devala</i>, whom <i>Nārada</i> questioned about the origin and destruction of all creatures (XII, <b>276</b>).—§ 689: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired after the means for removing desire. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of what was said by the <i>Videha</i> king to the inquiring <i>Māṇḍavya</i>: “Even if the whole of <i>Mithilā</i> burn in a conflagration, nothing of mine will be burnt down.” The brahman <i>Māṇḍavya</i> became filled with joy and betook himself to the path of emancipation (XII, <b>277</b>).—§ 690: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired about the good which one should pursue in view of the transient character of time. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of a discourse between a father, who was devoted only to the study of the <i>Vedas</i>, and his son <i>Medhāvin</i>, who was conversant with the religion of emancipation. The father acted in the way pointed out [by his son] (XII, <b>278</b>).—§ 691: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> explained of what behaviour a man should be, of what acts, of what kind of knowledge, etc., in order to be able to attain to <i>Bráhman</i> (XII, <b>279</b>).—§ 692: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked when he should succeed in abandoning sovereignty for adopting renunciation. <i>Bhīṣma's</i> answer stating the certainty of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> acquisition of emancipation, and quoting that discourse which was sung in days of old, viz. the conversation between Dai.

(XII, <b>308</b>). <i>Vasiṣṭha's</i> discourse on <i>buddha</i> and <i>abuddha</i>. “I had acquired this knowledge from the eternal <i>Hiraṇyagarbha</i> himself, who communicated it to me for my having carefully gratified that great Being of very superior Soul…; it has been imparted to thee exactly as I had it from <i>Brahmán</i> himself.” <i>Bhīṣma</i> said, “This knowledge was obtained by <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> from <i>Hiraṇyagarbha</i>, from <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> it was handed over to <i>Nārada</i>, and from this to me” (XII, <b>309</b>).—§ 706: <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the conversation between king <i>Vasumat</i>, son of <i>Janaka</i>, and a brahman and Ṛ. of <i>Bhṛgu's</i> race, whom <i>Vasumat</i> saw in the forests when in pursuit of deer, and by whom he was instructed. “R.-ṛ. <i>Mahābhiṣa</i>, through want of firmness, fell from heaven; <i>Yayāti</i>, though his merits had become exhausted, succeeded in regaining regions of bliss through his firmness.” King <i>Vasumat</i>, withdrawing his mind from the pursuit of desire, set it upon the acquisition of righteousness (XII, <b>310</b>).—§ 707: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on that which is freed from duty and its reverse by reciting the old narrative of the discourse between Ṛ. <i>Yājñavalkya</i> and king <i>Daivarāti Janaka</i>, who got instruction from <i>Yājñavalkya</i>.

The story of <i>Yājñavalkya's</i> acquisition of the <i>Yajurveda</i>, as a boon from <i>Sūrya</i>, who had been gratified with his penances; <i>Sūrya</i> had said: “Made up of the essence of speech, the goddess <i>Sarasvatī</i> will enter into thy body”; “he then commanded me to open my mouth; <i>Sarasvatī</i> then entered into my body and I began to burn, and plunged into a stream, angry with <i>Sūrya</i>, who told me that the burning would soon cease, and then the whole <i>Veda</i> with its appendix and the <i>Upaniṣads</i> would appear in me by inward light, and I should edit the entire <i>Śatapatha</i>, and then turn to the path of emancipation, coveted both by <i>Sāṅkhyas</i> and by <i>Yogins. Sūrya</i> then went to the <i>Asta</i> hills. <i>Sarasvatī</i> appeared before me (description). I taught the <i>Śatapathabrāhmaṇa</i>, etc., to 100 good disciples and thereby did what was disagreeable to my maternal uncle [<i>Vaiśampāyana</i>]. I undertook the management of the sacrifice of thy father; there a dispute arose between me and my maternal uncle as to who should be permitted to appropriate the <i>dakṣiṇā</i> for the recitation of the <i>Vedas</i>; in the very presence of <i>Devala</i> I took half of that <i>dakṣiṇā</i>; thy father and <i>Sumantu</i> and <i>Paila</i> and <i>Jaimini</i>, etc., all acquiesced in that arrangement. I had thus got from <i>Sūrya</i> the fifteen <i>Yajuṣes</i>, and likewise <i>Romaharṣa</i> learned the <i>Purāṇas</i> (differently PCR.). Aided by <i>Sarasvatī</i> and <i>Sūrya</i> I then set myself to compile the <i>Śatapathabrāhmaṇa…</i> G. <i>Viśvāvasu</i> (<i>Kāśyapa</i>, v. 11777), conversant with the <i>Vedānta</i>, once put me twenty-four questions relating to the <i>Vedas</i>, and then a twenty-fifth (<i>ānvīkṣikīṃ</i>) (α); having thought of <i>Sarasvatī</i> I answered them properly, having expounded to him the fourth science that treats of emancipation, and which is based upon the twenty-fifth principle, i.e. <i>jīva</i>.” (The answers to the questions.) The personal soul (<i>jīva</i>) and the Supreme Soul should be regarded as one and the same. This <i>Viśvāvasu</i> thought difficult to understand, quoting <i>Jaigīṣavya</i>, etc. (β); “M.-ṛ. in <i>Brahmaloka</i> say that <i>Āditya</i> (the sun) himself is thy preceptor.” <i>Yājñavalkya</i> instructed him of the relation of the twenty-fifth (<i>jīva</i>) to the twenty-sixth (the Supreme Soul). “<i>Viśvāvasu</i> proceeded towards heaven, and inculcated the science he had obtained from me to the gods in <i>Brahmaloka</i>, etc.” Honoured by <i>Daivarāti, Yājñavalkya</i> left his court; the king gave a million of kine, etc., to a number of brahmans; installing his son in the sovereignty of the <i>Videhas</i>, he adopted the practices of the <i>Yatis</i>, and began to study the science of the <i>Sāṅkhyas</i> and <i>Yogins</i>. “They who wait upon <i>Mahat</i> attain to the regions of <i>Mahat</i>; they who wait upon Consciousness attain to the spot that belongs to Consciousness, etc.” “I (<i>Bhīṣma</i>) got all this knowledge from <i>Janaka</i>, who had obtained it from <i>Yājñavalkya</i>” (XII, <b>319</b>).—§ 708: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked how one may avoid decrepitude and death. <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the old narrative of the <i>Bhikṣu</i> M.-ṛ. <i>Pañcaśikha</i> and king <i>Janaka Vaideha</i>, who put him that same question and was instructed by him (XII, <b>320</b>).—§ 709: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> as to how it is possible for a householder to attain to emancipation, <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the <is>Sulabhā-</is> <is>Janakasaṃvāda</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>321</b>).—§ 710: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired how in days of old <i>Śuka Vaiyāsaki</i> was won over to renunciation (<i>nirvedam āpannaḥ). Bhīṣma</i> recited the discourse of <i>Vyāsa</i> to <i>Śuka</i> expounding the vanity of worldly attachments. “That sinful wretch who transgresses the ten boundaries that have been fixed by <i>Svayambhū</i> himself is obliged to pass his time in great affliction in the wild wastes in the dominions of the king of the <i>Pitṛs</i>; that man who is tainted with cupidity… has to go to deep hells…and is forced to bathe in the broad river <i>Vaitaraṇī</i>, whose waters are scalding, etc. (description of hell)…Very soon the wind of <i>Yama</i> will blow before thee…By performing the duties of the domestic life men attain to the region of <i>Prajāpati</i> or <i>Bṛhaspati</i> or <i>Indra</i>.” <i>Śuka</i>, leaving his father, proceeded to seek a preceptor that could teach him the religion of emancipation (XII, <b>322</b>).—§ 711: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, <i>Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on the efficacy of gifts, sacrifices, penances, services to preceptors, etc. (XII, <b>323</b>).— § 712: Śukotpatti (q.v.).—§ 713: Śukakṛti (q.v.).—§ 714: Śukakṛtya (q.v.).—§ 715: Śuka-Nārada-saṃvāda (q.v.).— § 716: Śukābhipatana (q.v.) (XII, <b>324—334</b>).—§ 717: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked who the Supreme Deity is, etc. <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the old story of the discourse between <i>Nārada</i> and Ṛ. <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> in the hermitage of <i>Badarī</i>, i.e. <is>Nārāyaṇīya</is> (<i>b</i>), including the story of <i>Uparicara (c</i>) and <is>Brahma-</is> <is>Rudra-saṃvāda</is> (<i>d</i>) (XII, <b>335—352</b>).—§ 718: Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> about the foremost duties of men belonging to the different modes of life, <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the discourse on this topic in days of yore between D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Indra</i>, i.e. <is>Uñchavṛtty-upākhyāna</is> (<i>b</i>) (XII, <b>353—356</b>)."
