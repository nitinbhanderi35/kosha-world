At that time <i>Nārada</i> proceeded to <i>Himavat (b</i>). Then <i>Śuka</i> came to the asylum of <i>Vyāsa</i>. One day the disciples asked <i>Vyāsa</i> to let no sixth disciple be skilled in the Veda. <i>Vyāsa</i> answered that they ought to multiply, and the Veda to be spread, and taught them the qualifications of persons that can be accepted as disciples, and the rules in respect of the study of the Veda (XII, <b>328</b>). The disciples of <i>Vyāsa</i> took leave of him and descended from the mountain to the earth for the purpose of subdividing the Vedas; there they performed the agniṣṭoma, etc., at the sacrifices of Brahmans, Kṣattriyas, and Vaiśyas, and taught the Veda. <i>Vyāsa</i> remained with <i>Śuka</i>, passing his days in anxious thoughtfulness. <i>Nārada</i> came and asked him why Vedic sounds were silent now, so that the mountain now resembled a hamlet of <i>Niṣādas</i>, and Ṛ., D., and G. did no longer shine as before; and exhorted <i>Vyāsa</i> to recite the Veda and thereby dispel the fears arising from Rā. <i>Vyāsa</i> and <i>Śuka</i> then set themselves to recite the Veda. One day a violent wind arose which <i>Vyāsa</i> declared to be an omen that the recitation of the Veda should be suspended; and he explained the <i>Devayāna</i> and the <i>Pitṛyāna</i>, and the Winds (<i>Samāna</i>, etc. <i>[g]</i>; cf. <i>Sādhyāḥ</i>), especially <i>Pravaha (h</i>), <i>Āvaha (i), Udvaha (j), Saṃvaha (k), Vivaha (l), Parivaha</i> (<i>m), Parāvaha (n</i>); “this wind is the breath of <i>Viṣṇu's</i> nostrils.” Having said this <i>Vyāsa</i> plunged into the celestial Ganges. (For continuation v. <i>Śuka-Nāradasaṃvāda</i>.)"
