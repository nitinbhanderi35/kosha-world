            "content": "<b>Jaitrāyaṇa Saho-jit</b>¦ is apparently in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> the name of a prince who celebrated the Rājasūya, or ‘royal consecration.’ Von Schroeder<sup>2</sup> quotes in support of Jaitrāyaṇa as a proper name the derivative Jaitrāyaṇi, ‘descendant of Jaitra,’ formed according to the Gaṇa <i>karṇādi,</i> which is referred to by Pāṇini;<sup>3</sup> but it should be noted that in the parallel passage of the Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> the reading is different, and no proper personal name appears, the subject being Indra, the god. This reading seems much more probable, for the verse should be general, and suit every king performing the rite. <F>1) xviii. 5.</F> <F>2) <i>Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen-</i> <i>lāndischen Gesellschaft,</i> 49, 168.</F> <F>3) iv. 2, 80.</F> <F>4) xxviii. 5, cited by von Schroeder <i>Kāṭhaka,</i> 1, p. 269.</F>"
