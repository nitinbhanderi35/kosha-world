None of the Devas condescended to bless a poor brahmin, who once performed penance in the forest when a cloud called Kuṇḍadhāra appeared and told him that, if the Devas would permit, he (cloud) would bless him. Immediately the Deva called Māṇibhadra requested the cloud to bless the brahmin. The cloud did so and the brahmin attained salvation. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 271)."
