When Śrī Rāma visited Śarabhaṅga's āśrama, Indra too came there, but went away saying that he would meet the maharṣi after the great mission of Rāma was over. The maharṣi told Rāma that he was waiting to see him and did not accompany Indra to Devaloka as he wanted to go there only after seeing Rāma. Rāma answered the Maharṣi that he would take upon himself all the spiritual assets and good results of the actions of the Maharṣi, and wanted him to point out a place for them (Rāma and others) to live. Śarabhaṅga directed them to the āśrama of Sutīkṣṇa, and after that ended his life by leaping into the fire and attained Brahmaloka."
