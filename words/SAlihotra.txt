A drink of the water in the pond here quenches hunger and thirst. The tree and the pond were created by the power of Śālihotra's tapas. The Pāṇḍavas, during their life in exile in the forest, visited this place in the company of Hiḍimbī and quenched their hunger and thirst by drinking water from this pond. (M.B., Southern text, Chapter 154). Śālihotra was an adept in aśvasastra (science about horses). To bathe in the tīrtha called Śālisūrya created by the muni is to derive the same result as that of making a gift of a thousand cows. (Vana Parva, Chapter 71, Verse 27 and Chapter 83, Verse 107)."
