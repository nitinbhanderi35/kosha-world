            "content": "JAGANNĀTHA¦ PAṆḌITA. A very powerful and ruthless literary critic in Sanskrit. He lived between 1590 and 1665. He is also known as Paṇḍitarāja (King of scholars). His most important and well-known work is Rasagaṅgādhara. To this day it remains as an invaluable treasure in rhetorics. (Alaṅkāra Śāstra). <dvsn n='NI'/>His poetic theory is “Ramaṇīyārthapratipādakaḥ Śabdaḥ Kāvyam”. (Words which convey beautiful meanings constitute poetry). He vehemently opposed the dhvani vāda (suggestive words and phrases conveying more meanings produce more rasa than they literally and apparently appear to carry). CitramīmāṃsāKhaṇḍana is another work of the Paṇḍitarāja. In this work another rhetorician named Appayadīkṣita is strongly criticised. The allegoric poem, “Bhāminīvilāsam”, is supposed to have been written by this great rhetorician based on the untimely death of his wife, Bhāminī. He has also written five other works, the five Laharīs [Gaṅgālaharī etc]."
