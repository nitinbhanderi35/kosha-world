One of the seven islands. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>General.</i> Śālmali island, which is double in extent of Plakṣa island is surrounded by Ikṣurasa (sugar-cane juice) ocean on all four sides of it. There are seven mountains there which produce gems and they are seven boundaries which separate the regions. Just like this, there are also seven rivers there. The seven rivers are Yoni, Toyā, Vitṛṇā, Candrā, Muktā, Vimocanī and Nirvṛti. Mere remembrance of the seven rivers is sufficient to annihilate all sins. Here people divided into the four classes live. Brahmins, Kṣatriyas Vaiśyas and Śūdras here are called Kapilas, Aruṇas, Pītas and Kṛṣṇas. These devout people worship Viṣṇu in the form of Vāyu by sublime yajñas. Devas are ever present on this most beautiful island. A tree named Sālmali which gives mental comfort grows in this island. The island is surrounded on all four sides by an ocean of Surā (liquor). (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part II, Chapter 4). <dvsn n='NI'/>2). <i>Śālmali island and nāgāstra.</i> See under Nāgastra."
