            "content": "<b>Upala-prakṣiṇī</b>¦ occurs once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it designates the occupation of a woman, as opposed to that of her son, who is a poet (<i>kāru</i>), and to that of his father, who is a physician (<i>bhiṣaj</i>). Yāska<sup>2</sup> renders the word by ‘maker of groats’ (<i>saktu-kārikā</i>), and Roth,<sup>3</sup> Grassmann,<sup>4</sup> Zimmer,<sup>5</sup> as well as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn. Pischel,<sup>6</sup> however, who points out that corn was not ground between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle (<i>dṛṣad</i>), considers that Upala-prakṣiṇī denotes a woman that assisted at the crushing of Soma (<i>cf.</i> <b>Upara</b>). Von Schroeder,<sup>7</sup> who more correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding <i>upala</i> as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’ <F>1) ix. 112, 3.</F> <F>2) Nirukta, vi. 5.</F> <F>3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, <i>s.v.</i></F> <F>4) <i>Ibid., s.v.,</i> ‘fitting the upper (to the lower) millstone.’</F> <F>5) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 269. <i>Cf.</i> Hillebrandt, <i>Vedaschrestomathie, s.v.,</i> who, taking <i>pṛc</i> in the sense of ‘fill,’ explains the compound as ‘filling the upper millstone,’ an interpretation which as it stands is unintelligible.</F> <F>6) <i>Vedische Studien,</i> 1, 308-310.</F> <F>7) <i>Mysterium und Mimus,</i> 412 <i>et seq.</i> Von Schroeder does not accept the view that the mother of the singer is alluded to; but it seems impossible to draw any other conclusion from the language of the passage, and his own explanation of the word as referring to a corn-mother is very improbable; <i>cf.</i> Keith, <i>Journal of the Royal</i> <i>Asiatic Society,</i> 1909, 204.</F>"
