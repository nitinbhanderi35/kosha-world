Once the maharṣi called Śyāvāśva invited Rathavīti to perform a homa at the yajña conducted by King Taranta, and when he came for the homa with his daughter the father of Śyāvāśva asked him to marry his daughter to Śyāvāśva. Rathavīti not only refused, but also dismissed Śyāvāśva from the yājñic platform. At last Rathavīti married his daughter to Śyāvāśva at the request of King Taranta. (Ṛgveda, Sāyaṇabhāṣya)."
