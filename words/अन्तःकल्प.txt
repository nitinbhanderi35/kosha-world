(-ल्पः) A cycle of the Buddhistic era. ‘From the time that man's age increases from ten years to an Asankhya and again decreases from an Asankhya to ten years, is an Antaḥkalpa. Were the surface of the earth to increase in elevation at the rate of one inch in a 1000 years and the process to continue in the same proportion, the elevation would extend to 28 miles before the Antaḥkalpa would be concluded. Twenty Antaḥkalpas make an Asankhyakalpa. Four Asankhyakalpas make a Mahākalpa.’ (Hardy, Manual of Buddhism.) E. अन्तर् and कल्प."
