Though she lived with him for six months he did not have any kind of contact with her. The prince returned. Wicked people tried to arouse doubts about the chastity of his wife and the householder. But it was futile. Still fearing calumny Dharmākara entered fire. In that test by fire he came out victorious. Not only did his body remain unscorched, but also that the faces of the wicked people who blamed him were filled with leprosy and became ugly. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi khaṇḍa, Chapter 50)."
