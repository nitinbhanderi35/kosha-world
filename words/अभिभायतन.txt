(-नम्) (In Buddhistic doctrine.) ‘The basis of mastership or superiority’; अभिभायतनानि or the (eight) bases of superiority are the (eight) mental accomplishments or superior powers of a man who by having internally the <i>idea of form,</i> perceives externally <sup>1</sup> <i>limited</i> or <sup>2</sup> <i>illimited forms,</i> either <i>with agreeable</i> or <i>disagreeable colours,</i> by having internally the <i>idea of absence of form</i> perceives externally <sup>3</sup> <i>limited</i> or <sup>4</sup> <i>illimited forms,</i> either, too, <i>with</i> <i>agreeable</i> or <i>disagreeable colours,</i> and by having internally the <i>idea of absence of form</i> perceives externally <sup>5</sup> <i>dark-blue</i> <i>forms with dark-blue colours, aspect or appearance, <sup>6</sup> yellow</i> <i>forms with yellow colours, aspect or appearance, <sup>7</sup> red forms</i> <i>with red colours, aspect or appearance,</i> and <sup>8</sup> <i>white forms</i> <i>with white colours, aspect or appearance.</i> See <i>Burnouf's Lo-</i> <i>tus de la bonne loi;</i> append. XV. E. अभिभा 2. and आयतन; (<i>Burnouf 1. c.</i> considers the word as a <i>Pāli</i> form representing the Sanskṛt अभिभ्वायतन, i. e. अभिभु or अभिभू and आयतन, and renders it accordingly ‘the place or region of the <i>conqueror</i>’; but as अभिभा = अभिभूति or अभिभव may also have the active meaning, it seems better to adopt the given E. and to take the word as a pure Sanskṛt compound, meaning ‘that on which victory rests’, and similar in formation to the Buddh. रूपायतन or आकाशा- नन्त्यायतन)."
