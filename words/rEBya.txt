Information about this hermit, found in the Mahābhārata is given below: <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) Raibhya who was a friend of Bharadvāja had two sons named Arvāvasu and Parāvasu. They were great scholars. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 135, Stanza 12). <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) Bharadvāja once forbade his son Yavakrīta from going to the hermitage of Raibhya.

Knowing this Bharadvāja ran to that place and cursed Raibhya that his eldest son would kill him. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once Parāvasu, mistaking his father for a cruel animal killed him. By the effort of his second son Arvāvasu, Raibhya was brought to life again. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 138, Stanza 137). <dvsn n='NI'/>(3) Raibhya was the son of Aṅgiras. (M.B.

Bṛhaspati replied that attainment of heaven could be had, not by action but only by devotion. Raibhya immediately started to Gayā to do penance. There he met with the Sanatkumāras. (Varāha Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Urvaśī made an earnest effort to hinder the severe vow and penance of Raibhya. But it was of no use, and by his curse, that celestial woman became ugly. She entreated him for liberation from the curse. Raibhya blessed her and said that she could obtain her original form by bathing in Yodhinīkuṇḍa. (Yoginī Kuṇḍa). Urvaśī bathed in Yodhinīkuṇḍa and from that day onwards that tīrtha (holy bath) came to be known as Urvaśīyoginīkuṇḍa."
