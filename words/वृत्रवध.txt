            "content": "[<b>Vṛtra-vadha(ḥ)</b>]¦ (“the killing of Vṛtra”): § 693<i>b</i> (Mokṣadh.). <i>Bhīṣma</i> said: In days of yore, <i>Indra</i>, accompanied by the celestial forces, proceeded in his chariot, and beheld As: <i>Vṛtra</i>, stationed before him like a mountain, 500 <i>yojanas</i> in height and 300 in circumference. <i>Indra</i> was struck with palsy in the lower extremities. On the eve of that great battle between D. and As. there arose loud shouts from both sides, etc. <i>Vṛtra</i> felt neither awe nor fear. Then the encounter commenced; the entire welkin was enveloped by the combatants of both sides; all the gods with <i>Brahmán</i>, and Ṛ., Si., G., and Aps. on their chariots had assembled in order to see the battle. <i>Vṛtra</i> shot rocks, the gods arrows; <i>Vṛtra</i> employed illusion; <i>Indra</i> was stupefied; <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> restored him to his senses by the <i>Rathantara</i>, pointing out to him <i>Brahmán</i>, etc. (α). <i>Indra</i>, by <i>yoga</i>, dispelled the illusions of <i>Vṛtra. Bṛhaspati</i> (the son of <i>Aṅgiras</i>) and Ṛ. repaired to <i>Śiva</i>, whose energy became a fever and penetrated <i>Vṛtra; Viṣṇu</i> entered the thunderbolt of <i>Indra; Bṛhaspati</i>, <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, and Ṛ. urged <i>Indra</i> to slay <i>Vṛtra</i>, and so did <i>Śiva</i>, saying that <i>Vṛtra</i> was the soul of the universe, capable of going everywhere; for 60,000 years <i>Vṛtra</i> had practised penances in order to obtain strength; <i>Brahmán</i> had given him the boons he had solicited: the greatness of <i>yogins</i>, large powers of illusions, excess of might, etc.; <i>Śiva</i> told <i>Indra</i> to slay him with <i>yoga</i>, and imparted to him his own energy. D. and Ṛ. uttered loud cheers, etc. Suddenly all As. were afflicted with the loss of memory; in a trice their powers of illusion also disappeared. Ṛ. and D. praised <i>Śakra</i> and <i>Śiva</i> (XII, <b>282</b>). Description of the symptoms that appeared on the body of <i>Vṛtra</i> when he was overtaken by that fever; His memory issued out of his mouth in form of a dreadful jackal. Inauspicious omens. <i>Indra</i> looked hard at him; <i>Vṛtra</i> yawned and uttered superhuman cries; while <i>Vṛtra</i> was yawning <i>Indra</i> hurled his thunderbolt at him and slew him; [XII, <b>287</b>, 58 ff. = 10,267 ff.: the thunderbolt cut <i>Vṛtra</i> into two halves; <i>Vṛtra</i> then came to the highest region of <i>Viṣṇu</i>, for it was by his devotion to <i>Viṣṇu</i> that he had overwhelmed the universe]; then <i>Indra</i> entered heaven with that thunderbolt pervaded by <i>Viṣṇu</i>. Then <i>Brahmavadhyā</i> (description) issued out of the body of the slain <i>Vṛtra</i>. A little while after, when <i>Indra</i> was proceeding towards heaven, she seized him and stuck to him. <i>Indra</i> entered the fibres of a lotus stalk and dwelt there for many years. But <i>Brahmavadhyā</i> pursued him closely, and deprived him of all his energy. At last he repaired to <i>Brahmán</i>, who made her leave <i>Indra</i> by apportioning one quarter to <i>Agni</i> (whence it should enter him who did not offer oblations of seed, etc. to <i>Agni</i>); one quarter to the trees, herbs, and all kinds of grass (whence it should possess the men who would cut or tear any of them at <i>parvan</i>-days); one quarter to the <i>Apsarases</i> (whence it should possess that man who would cohabit with women during their courses); and one quarter to the waters (whence it should possess that man who would cast into the waters phlegm and urine and excrements). With <i>Brahmán's</i> permission <i>Indra</i> then performed a horse-sacrifice and thereby became cleansed, regained his prosperity, and slew thousands of foes. From the blood of <i>Vṛtra</i> were born the <i>śikhaṇḍāḥ</i> (the crests of cocks (?) or name of a plant, BR.), which, for this reason, must not be eaten by the twiceborn classes, etc. Blessing upon the reciter (XII, <b>283</b>)."
