He went into the forest where he drowned the child of maharṣi Ugraśravas The maharṣi cursed him that he also should end his life by drowning and his soul roam about in unsupportable distress. The curse came true. After roaming about for many years he approached Agastya and prayed for redemption from the curse. The sage directed his disciple, Sutīkṣṇa to get holy water from Agnitīrtha in Mount Gandhamādana and sprinkle it on the sinful soul of Duṣpaṇya. Sutīkṣṇa did as he was asked by the guru, and the soul of Duṣpaṇya attained salvation. (Setumāhātmyam)."
