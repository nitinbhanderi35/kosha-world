Within a moment it assumes a different form, and cannot be described. It is neither cold nor warm, without hunger or thirst, etc.; it is not supported by columns; it is eternal, etc. There <i>Sarvalokapitāmaha</i> (i.e. <i>Brahmán</i>) is sitting, himself alone incessantly creating by means of his divine illusion (<i>deva-</i> <i>māyayā</i>), surrounded by the <i>prajānāṃ patayaḥ</i> (enumeration), etc. (α) (II, <b>11</b>)."
