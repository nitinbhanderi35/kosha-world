Piṣṭapura is the same as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also refers to Piṣṭapura.<sup>321</sup> Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.<sup>322</sup> It was the capital of Kaliṅga.<sup>323</sup> ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued a grant<sup>324</sup> from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.<sup>325</sup> In our inscription Devarāṣṭra<sup>326</sup> has been treated separately. It seems that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavarman they were amalgamated. <dvsn n='P'/>Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbouring regions.<sup>327</sup> Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in Kaliṅga.<sup>328</sup> Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been another name given to him on account of the extension of his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.<sup>329</sup> It is interesting to note that Kālidāsa<sup>330</sup> refers to Raghu defeating a king named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign. It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri. After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.<sup>331</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kuntimādhava.<sup>332</sup> We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī, a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa during the Gupta period.<sup>333</sup> This must be a local form of some popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.<sup>334</sup> <dvsn n='P'/><i>Place-names ending in the Suffix Nagara</i>"
