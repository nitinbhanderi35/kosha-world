In days of old Brahmā performed a sacrifice on the banks of the heavenly Gaṅgā on a peak of mount Mahāmeru. While Brahmā was sitting in deep meditation in the sacrifice Lohāsura was seen coming to cause disturbance to the sacrifice. Immediately a male being came into existence from the meditation of Brahmā. The male being paid homage to Brahmā and the devas (gods) became glad and they encouraged the male being. Because the gods greeted the male one, he was changed to a sword called Nandaka (that which is greeted or thanked for). That sword was received by Mahāviṣṇu at the request of the gods. When Mahāviṣṇu slowly took it Lohāsura came near. He was an asura of blue complexion, with thousand hands of adamantine fists. By wielding his club he drove away the gods. Mahāviṣṇu cut down his limbs one by one and those organs became metals by the touch of the sword. Then Mahāviṣṇu killed the asura. Then Mahāviṣṇu granted Nandaka a pure body and various boons. Afterwards Nandaka became the deity of weapons on the earth. Thus Brahmā, who got rid of the disturbance by the aid of Viṣṇu, completed the sacrifice. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 245)."
