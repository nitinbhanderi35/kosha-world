The provocation for Parāśara to conduct the yajña was that a Rākṣasa called Kalmāṣapāda ate Śakti, the father of the muni and the son of Vasiṣṭha. When the yajña had reached its climax Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu went to Parāśara and held conciliatory talks with him, and Parāśara, ended the yajña. The Agni that he had made to devour the Rākṣasas was discarded on the slopes of the Himālayas. According to the Purāṇas that fire, even to this day, continues consuming the Rākṣasas, trees and rocks. (For details see under Kalmāṣapāda and Parāśara)."
