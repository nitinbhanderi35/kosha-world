Āpaddh.): Nakula (<i>b</i>) questioned Bhīṣma as to which (the sword or the bow) is really the foremost of weapons, and how the sword was first created and for what purpose, and who was the first instructor in the use of that weapon. Bhīṣma related that in ancient times the universe was one vast expanse of water, enveloped in darkness, etc. There <i>Pitāmaha</i> (i.e. <i>Brahmán</i>) took his birth, he then created wind, fire, etc., and then assuming a visible form he begot <i>Marīci</i>, etc. (α) [and <i>Pracetas</i>; the last begot] <i>Dakṣa (c</i>). When <i>Sarvaloka-</i> <i>pitāmaha</i> (i.e. <i>Brahmán</i>) had called into existence all creatures he promulgated the eternal religion laid down in the <i>Vedas</i>. That religion was accepted by the gods with their preceptors and priests, and by Ā., V., R., S., M., A., <i>Bhṛgu, Atri, Aṅgiras</i>, Si., the <i>Kāśyapas, Vasiṣṭha</i>, etc. (β); all of them lived in obedience to <i>Brahmán</i>. But the foremost of the <i>Dānavas, Hiraṇyakaśipu</i>, etc. (γ), and many other <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Dānavas</i>, filled with wrath and covetousness, took delight in all kinds of wicked acts, etc., wielding only the rod of chastisement; those foremost of <i>Asuras</i> forsook every kindly intercourse with other creatures. Then <i>Brahmán</i> with the <i>Brahmarṣis</i> proceeded to a delightful summit of <i>Himavat</i>, and after 1,000 years he arranged a sacrifice. From the sacrificial fire arose <i>Asi</i> (“the sword”) (<i>d</i>), which <i>Brahmán</i> gave to <i>Rudra</i> (i.e. <i>Śiva</i>) in order to enable him to put down irreligion. <i>Rudra</i> (description) with the sword destroyed and dispersed the <i>Asuras (Dānavas</i>); some of them penetrated into the bowels of the earth, others got under the cover of the mountains, some went upwards, others entered the depths of the sea. <i>Rudra</i> then gave the sword to <i>Viṣṇu</i>, <i>Viṣṇu</i> to <i>Marīci, Marīci</i> to the <i>maharṣis</i>, the <i>maharṣis</i> to <i>Vāsava</i> (i.e. <i>Indra</i>), <i>Mahendra</i> (i.e. <i>Indra</i>) to the <i>lokapālas</i>, the <i>lokapālas</i> to <i>Manu (e</i>) the son of <i>Sūrya</i>. He gave it to his son <i>Kṣupa</i>. Thence it passed successively to <i>Ikṣvāku</i>, etc. (δ), from <i>Droṇa</i> to <i>Kṛpa</i>, from <i>Kṛpa</i> to thee (<i>Nakula</i>) and thy brothers. <i>Kṛttikāḥ</i> is the <i>nakṣatra</i> of the sword, <i>Agni</i> its deity, <i>Rohiṇī</i> its <i>gotra, Rudra</i> its high preceptor. Its eight mysterious names are <i>Asi</i>, etc. (ε). Of all weapons the sword is the foremost; the <i>Purāṇas</i> truly declare that it was first wielded by <i>Maheśvara</i> (i.e. <i>Śiva</i>). <i>Pṛthu (Vainya</i>) (<i>f</i>) created the first bow. Persons skilled in weapons should always worship the sword. Blessing to the reader (XII, <b>166</b>)."
