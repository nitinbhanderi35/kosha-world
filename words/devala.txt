Prathama Skandha). <dvsn n='NI'/>Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa contains the following story about Devala. Devala was the son born to Asitamuni as the result of a boon granted by Śiva. Raṃbhā, the heavenly dancer fell in love with him. But, Devala did not reciprocate her love. So, she cursed him to become crooked in body. When he became crooked thus he came to be called Aṣṭāvakra. For six thousand years he did penance after which Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā appeared to him. Rādhā laughed at the uncouth form of Aṣṭāvakra. But, Kṛṣṇa admonished her and embraced him. At once his bodily crookedness disappeared and he became very handsome. A vimāna then descended from heaven, and Rādhā, Kṛṣṇa and muni together disappeared in it. <dvsn n='NI'/>Ekaparṇā, daughter of Himavān was this Devala's wife. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter 18)."
