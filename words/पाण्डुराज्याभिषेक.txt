Virtuously ruled by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, the kingdom was adorned with hundreds of <i>caityas</i> and <i>yūpas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu</i>, and <i>Vidura</i> were brought up by <i>Bhīṣma</i> as if they were his own children, and became well exercised in archery, etc., and well read in the <i>Itihāsas</i> and <i>Purāṇas</i> and various sciences, and the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Vedāṅgas. Pāṇḍu</i> excelled all men in archery, <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> in personal strength, <i>Vidura</i> in devotion to virtue. <i>Hāstinapura</i> was the foremost among cities. Because of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> blindness and <i>Vidura's</i> being a <i>pārasava</i> (son of a <i>brahman</i> with a <i>śūdra</i> woman), <i>Pāṇḍu</i> became king. One day <i>Bhīṣma</i> addressed <i>Vidura</i> [about the marriage of the two princes] (I, <b>109</b>)."
