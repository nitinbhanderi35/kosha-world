They wandered under a compact of telling each other their inmost thoughts. They arrived at the court of <i>Sṛñjaya (Śvaitya). Nārada</i> was taken with the charms of <i>Sṛñjaya's</i> daughter <i>Sukumārī</i>; but shamefulness prevented him from disclosing his love to <i>Parvata</i>, who then cursed him for his reticence, saying that <i>Sukumārī</i> should become his wife, but then she and every man should behold him in the shape of an ape. <i>Nārada</i> cursed <i>Parvata</i> in return, saying that he should not succeed in proceeding to heaven. <i>Parvata</i> began to wander over the earth. <i>Sukumārī</i> beheld <i>Nārada</i> as an ape, but devoted herself entirely to him, and did not desire any D., Mu., or Y. for a husband. <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Parvata</i>, after some time, became reconciled and withdrew their mutual curses. <i>Sukumārī</i> fled, thinking <i>Nārada</i> to be somebody else, but was informed by <i>Parvata. Parvata</i> proceeded to heaven and <i>Nārada</i> to his home. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> continued: “Ṛ. <i>Nārada</i> is here; he will tell thee everything that happened” (XII, <b>30</b>)."
