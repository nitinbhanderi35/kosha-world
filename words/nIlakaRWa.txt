He has written works in all the branches of literature. His more important works are Śivalīlārṇava, Gaṅgāvataraṇa. Nīlakaṇṭhavijaya Campū, and Kaliviḍambana. Śivalīlārṇava contains twentytwo cantos. Its theme is the sixtyfour līlās (Divine sports) of Śiva installed at Madura. (South India) Gaṅgāvataraṇa is a poem in eight cantos which describes the story of Bhagīratha bringing Gaṅgā down to the earth. In the first canto of Nīlakaṇthavijaya, A.D. 1638-39 is referred to as the period of its composition, and this reference helps us to determine the date of the poet."
