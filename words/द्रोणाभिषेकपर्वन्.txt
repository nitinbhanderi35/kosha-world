Droṇābhiṣecana). § 589: <i>Janamejaya</i> enquired of the state of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> on the receipt of intelligence of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> death. <i>Vaiśampāyana's</i> answer: <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> about what the <i>Kauravas</i> did after the fall of <i>Bhīṣma. Sañjaya</i> mentioned the arrow-pillow, etc. (cf. § 587 foll.), and that the warriors once more went to battle. The <i>Kurus</i> desired to make <i>Karṇa</i> their generalissimo (mentioning his enmity with <i>Bhīṣma</i>) (VII, <b>1</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> eulogised <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and promised to be their leader, mentioning the prowess of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (α); he commanded his charioteer to make his chariot ready (VII, <b>2</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> waited upon <i>Bhīṣma</i> (mentioning the danger to the <i>Kurus</i> from <i>Arjuna</i> with the <i>Gāṇḍīva</i>, etc.; <i>Arjuna's</i> battle with <i>Śiva</i>; <i>Kṛṣṇa; Bhīṣma's</i> battle with <i>Rāma</i>) (VII, <b>3</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i>, mentioning <i>Karṇa's</i> prowess against the <i>Kāmbojas</i>, etc. (β), urged him to fight for the victory of <i>Duryodhana</i>. Then <i>Karṇa</i> saluted <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and, at his return, was worshipped by <i>Duryodhana</i> and the <i>Kauravas</i> (VII, <b>4</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> asked <i>Karṇa's</i> advice as to who should become the generalissimo of the <i>Kuru</i> army. <i>Karṇa</i> proposed <i>Droṇa</i> (VII, <b>5</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> requested <i>Droṇa</i> to take the command (VII, <b>6</b>). <i>Droṇa</i>, mentioning his knowledge of the <i>Veda</i> and the <i>Śaiva</i> weapon, etc., and his inability to slay <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, accepted the request. <i>Duryodhana</i> and the kings performed the inauguration of <i>Droṇa</i>, at which the army rejoiced. <i>Droṇa</i> arrayed the troops: the <i>Sindhu</i> king, etc. (γ), in the right wing, supported by <i>Śakuni</i>, etc.; <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc. (δ), in the left wing, supported by the <i>Kāmbojas</i>, etc. (ε); the <i>Madras</i>, etc. (ζ), in the rear; <i>Karṇa</i> at the head of all the bowmen. The array was in the form of a <i>śakaṭa</i>(cart). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> disposed his troops in the form of a <i>krauñca</i> (crane), with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> at the head. Omens appeared when <i>Droṇa</i> proceeded to battle. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and <i>Sṛñjayas</i> were broken by <i>Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa</i> (VII, <b>7</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> urged <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> to check <i>Droṇa</i>. The <i>Kekaya</i> princes, etc. (η), “achieved diverse feats.” <i>Droṇa</i> put the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops to rout. <i>Droṇa</i> & the <i>Kekaya</i> princes, etc. (θ). At last <i>Droṇa</i>, having slain more than two <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i>, “proceeded hence to heaven” (“attained to the highest state”) slain by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>. D., P., etc., beheld him (VII, <b>8</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> asked <i>Sañjaya</i> the particulars of <i>Droṇa's</i> heroism and slaughter (mentioning his knowledge of the <i>Vedas</i>; his ability to remove <i>Meru</i>; his equality to <i>Bṛhaspati</i> or <i>Uśanas</i>; his horses of the <i>Sindhu</i> breed, etc. (ι)) (VII, <b>9</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> swooned away, and was restored to consciousness by the <i>Bharata</i> ladies. Then he enquired of <i>Sañjaya</i> about <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (κ), especially <i>Yuyudhāna</i> <i>Sātyaki (b</i>), and <i>Dhṛṣṭaketu (c</i>), and <i>Ketumat (d</i>); and the children of <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Kṣatrañjaya</i>, etc. (λ), who, giving up all sports for twelve years, and observing excellent vows, waited upon <i>Bhīṣma</i> for the sake of weapons; and the five <i>Kaikeya</i> brothers (<i>e</i>); and <i>Yuyutsu (f</i>), and <i>Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna (g</i>) (VII, <b>10</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> recited the feats of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>: the killing of <i>Hayarāja</i>, etc. (μ), that he had vanquished in battle the <i>Aṅgas</i>, etc. (ν), and that if <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> would summon them, <i>Gada</i>, etc. (ξ), would take up their position in the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> host; and regretted that <i>Duryodhana</i> did not know <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>; the destruction of the <i>Kurus</i> he attributed to himself or to Destiny (VII, <b>11</b>).—§ 590: <i>Sañjaya</i> begins his narrative in detail. THE ELEVENTH DAY'S BATTLE: <i>Duryodhana</i>, having consulted with <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duḥśāsana</i>, etc., asked <i>Droṇa</i> to seize <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> alive. <i>Droṇa</i> became very glad because <i>Duryodhana</i> had not asked him to slay <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana</i> explained that if <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> were slain, the other <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, who were invincible, would avenge him; but taken alive, he might be once more vanquished at dice, and so all the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> be obliged once more to go to the woods. <i>Droṇa</i> said that he would seize <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> if not protected by <i>Arjuna</i> (with his weapons from <i>Indra</i> and <i>Rudra</i>, etc.); <i>Arjuna</i>, therefore, must be withdrawn from <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana</i> proclaimed the promise of <i>Droṇa</i> to all his troops, in order to make him stick to his promise (VII, <b>12</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> learned through his spies that <i>Droṇa</i> had promised to seize him, and addressed his brothers and allies; <i>Arjuna</i> consoled him. A fierce battle commenced. Protected by <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, both hosts seemed to stand inactive. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> could not withstand <i>Droṇa</i>, who began to consume the division of <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (VII, <b>13</b>). <i>Droṇa</i> caused a river of blood to flow there. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa; Śakuni & Sahadeva; Droṇa & Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>dyumna; Bhīmasena & Viviṃśati; Śalya & Nakula; Dhṛṣṭa-</i> <i>ketu & Kṛpa; Sātyaki & Kṛtavarman; Senāpati & Suśarman</i>; <i>Virāṭa</i> (with the <i>Matsyas</i>) <i>& Karṇa; Drupada & Bhagadatta</i>; <i>Bhūriśravas & Śikhaṇḍin; Ghaṭotkaca & Alambuṣa; Śekitāna</i> <i>& Anuvinda; Lakṣmaṇa & Kṣatradeva; Paurava & Abhi-</i> <i>manyu; Paurava</i> was rescued by <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, and then by <i>Jayadratha; Abhimanyu</i> (letting <i>Paurava</i> alone) <i>& Jaya-</i> <i>dratha</i>, who was vanquished; <i>Śalya & Abhimanyu; Virāṭa</i>, etc. (α), praised <i>Abhimanyu; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's</i> sons + <i>Śalya</i> <i>& Abhimanyu</i> (VII, <b>14</b>); <i>Bhīmasena + Abhimanyu & Śalya</i>; <i>Bhīmasena</i> (causing <i>Abhimanyu</i> to stand aside) & <i>Śalya</i>; both fell down; <i>Kṛtavarman</i> took <i>Śalya</i> away on his chariot; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> vanquished the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> (VII, <b>15</b>). <i>Karṇa's</i> son <i>Vṛṣasena</i> attacked the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army; <i>Nakula's</i> son <i>Śatānīka & Vṛṣasena</i>; the <i>Draupadeyāḥ</i> + the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> <i>& Vṛṣasena + Aśvatthāman</i>, etc.; especially <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (β). The <i>Kuru</i> army was broken. <i>Droṇa & Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; the <i>Pāñcāla</i> prince <i>Kumāra</i> (the protector of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> car-wheels) <i>& Droṇa; Droṇa & Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc. (γ); <i>Droṇa</i> caused <i>Yugandhara</i> to fall down from the seat of his chariot; <i>Virāṭa</i>, etc. (δ), <i>& Droṇa; Vyāghradatta</i> (the <i>Pāñcāla</i> prince) <i>& Droṇa; Siṃhasena & Droṇa</i>, who slew both <i>Siṃhasena</i> and <i>Vyāghradatta; Arjuna</i>, in order to rescue <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, attacked <i>Droṇa's</i> division. Just then the sun set. <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i>, etc., withdrew their troops, and so did <i>Arjuna</i>. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ε), praised <i>Arjuna</i> (VII, <b>16</b>)."
