A Brāhmaṇa of Kanyākubja, versed in <i>śāstras</i> and celebrated in <i>ācāra.</i> Once when out to get <i>kuśa</i> grass, he saw a <i>dāsī</i> and fell in love. Then he abandoned all his duties and discarded his wedded wife. The <i>dāsī</i> became his wife. She bore him ten sons. The last was named Nārāyaṇa best loved of his parents. At the time of his death, when the messengers of Yama were waiting to remove him to hell, he called out his last son by his name Nārāyaṇa. On this, the messengers of Vīṣṇu were on the scene and prevented Yama's men from taking the Brāhman to hell. It was argued that pronouncing the name of Hari at his death redeemed him of all his sins, and that alone was the secret of Dharma. Yama heard this and approved it. Ajāmila, thus rescued from Death, felt penitent, and while making <i>tapas</i> at Gaṅgādvāra, he cast off his body and reached <i>Viṣṇuloka.</i> <dvsn n='P'/>Bhā. VI. 1. 20. to the end; Ib. VI. ch. 2 & 3."
