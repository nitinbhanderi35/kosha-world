They were the bodyguards of Bhīṣma. (Chapter 51, Bhīṣma Parva). They formed a separate division in the army of Bṛhannala, King of Kosala. (Chapter 87, Bhīṣma Parva). Once Karṇa conquered this country. (Śloka 8, Chapter 4, Droṇa Parva). Mekhalas were Kṣatriyas formerly. But they became persons of low caste when they showed jealousy towards the brahmins. (Śloka 17, Chapter 35, Anuśāsana Parva)."
