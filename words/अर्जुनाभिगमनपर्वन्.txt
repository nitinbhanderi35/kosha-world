As <i>Kṛṣṇa (b</i>) said: “the earth shall drink the blood of <i>Duryodhana</i>, etc.,” <i>Arjuna</i> tried to pacify him by reciting the feats achieved in his former lives (<i>b</i>); then <i>Arjuna</i>, the soul of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, became silent, and <i>Janārdana</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) (<i>b</i>) replied that he was identical with <i>Arjuna</i>. Then <i>Pāñcālī</i> (i.e. Kṛṣṇā), surrounded by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and her other brothers, praised <i>Kṛṣṇa (b</i>). She then blamed him and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> for having let her endure the shame of being dragged in the assembly, etc. (“fie on that <i>Gāṇḍīva (c</i>)”), and relates the persecutions of <i>Duryodhana</i> (cf. § 197) and the valour of <i>Bhīma</i> until the <i>svayaṃvara. Kṛṣṇa</i> promised that she should be avenged, and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> said: “I will slay <i>Droṇa; Śikhaṇḍin</i> <i>Pitāmaha</i> (i.e. Bhīṣma); <i>Bhīmasena Duryodhana</i>; and <i>Dhanañjaya</i> (i.e. Arjuna) <i>Karṇa</i>; assisted by <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> we are invincible in battle even to <i>Indra</i>” (III, <b>12</b>). —§ 318: <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that if he had not been absent from <i>Dvārakā</i> (v. 610: the <i>Anartta</i> country) at that time, he should have come and prevented the gambling by either persuading <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (relating how the son of <i>Vīrasena</i> was formerly deprived of his kingdom, etc.), or compelling him by force; on arriving at <i>Dvārakā</i> he had learnt from <i>Yuyudhāna</i> what had happened and had instantly come to see them (III, <b>13</b>). —§§ 319—321: Saubhavadhop. (q.v.).—§§ 322—324: Dvaītavanapraveśa (q.v.).—§§ 325—327: Draupadī-paritāpa-vākya (q.v.).—§§ 328—329: Kāmyakavana-praveśa (q.v.).—§ 330: Indradarśana (q.v.). For continuation v. Kairātaparvan."
