The second part of his name seems to be dropped and instead his professional epithet ‘vardhakin’ has been added which means ‘a carpenter’.<sup>519</sup> In Sāñcī Stūpa Inscriptions we get the word ‘vaḍakina’ which is the same as Sanskrit ‘vardhakin’ and means ‘carpenter’.<sup>520</sup> In the Aṅgavijjā,<sup>521</sup> we get the word ‘vaṭṭaki’ which denotes a metal worker."
