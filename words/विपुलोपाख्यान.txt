            "content": "[<b>Vipulopākhyāna(ṃ)</b>]¦ (“the episode about Vipula”): § 743<i>b</i> (Ānuśāsanik.). <i>Bhīṣma</i> said: There was, in days of yore, a Ṛ. <i>Devaśaraman</i>; his beautiful wife <i>Ruci</i> fascinated every one who saw her, both D., G., and Dā., and particularly <i>Indra. Devaśarman</i> knew very well the disposition of women, as well as <i>Indra's</i> coveting other men's wives. Once, desirous of performing a sacrifice, he summoned his favourite disciple <i>Vipula Bhārgava</i>, and asked him, during his absence, to protect <i>Ruci</i> against <i>Indra</i>, describing to him the disguises that <i>Indra</i> assumes (α). <i>Vipula</i>, by his <i>Yoga</i>-power, entered the body of <i>Ruci</i> (description) (XIII, <b>40</b>). <i>Indra</i> came, but <i>Ruci</i> was unable to move or to utter a word in reply; then, influenced by <i>Vipula</i>, she answered in <i>Sanskrit (? vāṇī</i> <i>saṃskārabhūṣaṇā</i>) words that she did not intend to utter. <i>Indra</i> became perplexed, and when he with his spiritual eye discovered <i>Vipula</i> within <i>Ruci</i>, he became afraid that he might curse him. <i>Vipula</i> left the body of <i>Ruci</i> and returned to his own body which was lying near, and rebuked <i>Indra</i>, mentioning <i>Gautama's</i> curse, owing to which <i>Indra's</i> body became disfigured with 1,000 sex-marks, which, owing to <i>Gautama's</i> compassion, were afterwards changed into eyes, “see that thou dost not, with thy sons and counselors, meet with destruction.” <i>Śakra</i>, overwhelmed with shame, made himself invisible. A moment after, <i>Devaśarman</i> came back, and granted <i>Vipula</i> the boon that he should never swerve away from righteousness; dismissed by his preceptor, <i>Vipula</i> left his abode and practised the most severe austerities. <i>Deva-</i> <i>śarman</i> also, with his spouse, began to live in the woods, perfectly fearless of <i>Indra</i> (XIII, <b>41</b>). <i>Vipula</i> became full of pride. After some time the occasion came for a ceremony of gifts, with respect to the sister of <i>Ruci</i> ~ the <i>Aṅga</i>-king <i>Citraratha</i>. Meanwhile, a celestial damsel dropped some flowers down to the earth; they were picked up by <i>Ruci</i>, who, adorned with them, went to the palace of the <i>Aṅga</i>king. Her sister, <i>Prabhāvatī</i>, the <i>Aṅga</i>-queen, urged her to obtain some for her, and <i>Ruci</i> informed her husband, who, summoning <i>Vipula</i>, commanded him to bring him some flowers of the same kind. <i>Vipula</i> found some such flowers still lying scattered, quite fresh, and set out for <i>Campā</i>; on his way he saw a human couple moving in a circle, hand in hand; a dispute arose between them, and at last, each of them took the oath “that one of us who speaks falsely shall, in the next world, meet with the end which will be <i>Vipula's</i>”. <i>Vipula</i> became very sad; proceeding a little way he beheld six other men playing with dice made of gold and silver; they were heard by <i>Vipula</i> to take the same oath as the first couple. At last he recollected the manner in which he had acted in protecting his preceptor's wife (placing limb within limb, face within face), without telling his preceptor the truth. Coming to <i>Campā</i>, he gave the flowers to his preceptor (XIII, <b>42</b>). <i>Devaśarman</i>, too, knew what he had seen on his way, and how he had acted in protecting <i>Ruci</i>; he explained that the first couple were Day and Night, the others the six Seasons. He absolved <i>Vipula</i> and ascended to heaven with his wife and his disciple. <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i> had narrated this tale to <i>Bhīṣma</i> on the banks of the <i>Gaṅgā</i> (XIII, <b>43</b>)."
