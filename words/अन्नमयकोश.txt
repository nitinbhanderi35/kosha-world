            "content": "अन्नमयकोश¦ Karmadh. m. (-शः) The sheath made of अन्न 2. 2., of the essence of the elementary creation, i. e. the material creation: the lowest form in which Brahman (n.) or the Supreme Soul is considered as manifesting itself in its worldly and conscious existence.--In the Taittirīya-Upan. अन्न of which the material creation is made, is the product of herbs, these of earth and so on in retrogression, of the elements water, fire and æther, the latter being the first product of the Supreme Soul; it would appear therefore that Brahman (n.) as अन्नमयकोश, in this Upanishad, is the totality of the <i>animal kingdom</i> only, since the vegetable kingdom precedes the creation of अन्न which is called also सर्वौषध (see अन्न 2. 2.) and the beings (प्रजाः or भूतानि) originating in अन्न, are represented as <i>living</i> through it (‘अथोऽनेनैव जीवन्ति’); but as अन्न on the other hand, is the essence of the elements preceding it, this form of Brahman would become in the Upanishad, constructively, the same that it is in the Vedānta explicitly, viz. the totality of the whole material creation. Yet while the Upanishad uses the terms æther, air, fire, water and earth to denote the elements in a general sense, the Vedānta distinguishes between ideal (सूक्ष्म) and real (स्थूल) elements and makes the अन्नमयकोश proceed from the latter which are an artificial mutual combination of portions of the former (see भूत, सूक्ष्मभूत and स्थूलभूत); and while the Upanishad contents itself with the general idea of totality, as expressed above, the Vedānta distinguishes between the conception that may be formed of the Supreme Soul as unity in this totality of the material creation (comp. समष्टि) and the conception that may be formed of it as multiplicity in it (comp. व्यष्टि); as unity it is called वैश्वानर or विराज्, as multiplicity विश्व, in either case it is जाग्रत्.--The forms superior to the अन्नमयकोश are in successive gradation प्राणमयकोश, मनोमयकोश, विज्ञानमयकोश and आनन्दमयकोश qq. vv. (the word कोश being supplied, in the Upanishad, by the comm. to अन्नमय &c.). Compare also सूक्ष्मशरीर and स्थू- लशरीर. E. अन्नमय and कोश. Also written अन्नमयकोष."
