Vaivāhika.) § 237. <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> related what had happened: (<i>Arjuna</i> had large red eyes, v. 7175, and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> had followed him, catching hold of his deerskin. v. 7177); from their conversation on military subjects, he concluded that they were the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, of whom it had been heard that they had all escaped from the lac-house. <i>Drupada</i> (= <i>Saumaki</i>, v. 7198) sent his <i>purohita</i> to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who said that there was no occasion for <i>Drupada</i> to grieve for his daughter. While <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was saying this, another messenger from <i>Drupada</i> announced that the feast was ready (I, <b>193</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, with <i>Kuntī</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> were conveyed to <i>Drupada's</i> palace. <i>Drupada</i> wished to ascertain to which caste they belonged, and had for that purpose made ready a large collection of various articles appertaining to different human occupations; after dinner they began to observe, with interest, the implements of war, wherefore <i>Drupada</i> and his son thought that they were of royal blood (I, <b>194</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> told <i>Drupada</i> who they were. <i>Drupada</i> vowed to restore <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> to his kingdom. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> told him that they would all marry <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, which <i>Drupada</i> considered to be contrary to morality. While they discoursed on this matter <i>Vyāsa</i> arrived (I, <b>195</b>). <i>Drupada</i> consulted <i>Vyāsa</i> about the wedding of his daughter. <i>Vyāsa</i> desired to hear the opinion of each of them. <i>Drupada</i> regarded the practice of marrying one wife to five men as sinful, and so did <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> thought it not to be sinful, because his heart, that never inclined to what was sinful, approved of it; “it is recorded in the <i>Purāṇa</i> that <i>Jaṭilā</i> <i>Gautamī</i> had married seven <i>ṛṣis</i>, and a <i>muni's</i> daughter, born of a tree (<i>Vārkṣī</i> [= <i>Māriṣā</i>, BR.], see Hariv., v. 96 foll.) married the ten <i>Pracetases</i>”; moreover, their mother <i>Kuntī</i> had told them to enjoy her all. <i>Kuntī</i> was afraid that she would be guilty of a lie. <i>Vyāsa</i> said that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was right, and took <i>Drupada</i> apart (I, <b>196</b>) and related to him <i>Pañcendropākhyāna</i> (§§ 238—239).—§ 240. <i>Drupada</i> then consented, as it had been ordained by the gods. <i>Vyāsa</i> declared that very day to be auspicious as the moon entered in conjunction with <i>Puṣya (Pauṣyaṃ yogam upaiti</i>). <i>Drupada</i> and his son made preparations for the wedding, and <i>Dhaumya</i>, performing the usual rites, married <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, and then to his brothers on successive days. <i>Draupadī</i> regained her virginity every day after her previous marriage. Then <i>Drupada</i> gave to them various kinds of excellent wealth (I, <b>198</b>). <i>Drupada</i>, after his alliance with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, had all his fears dispelled. His ladies worshipped the feet of <i>Kunitī. Kuntī</i> pronounced a blessing upon <i>Kṛṣṇā. Kṛṣṇa</i> sent them costly presents (I, <b>199</b>)."

On the third day the five <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, attired in white robes after a bath, etc., entered the palace of <i>Virāṭa</i> and took their seats on the thrones reserved for kings. <i>Virāṭa</i> rebuked <i>Kaṅka (Yudhiṣṭhira</i>) for this insolence; <i>Arjuna</i> praised <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, saying that there was none like him, even amongst D., As., men, Rā., G., Y., Ku., or M.-U., and disclosed that he was <i>Yudhiṣṭhira (b</i>) (IV, <b>70</b>). Asked by <i>Virāṭa</i> which of them then was <i>Arjuna</i>, etc., <i>Arjuna</i> pointed out <i>Bhīma</i> (β), <i>Nakula</i>, and <i>Sahadeva</i> (both beautiful and great warriors), <i>Draupadī</i>, and himself. <i>Uttara</i> spoke of <i>Arjuna's</i> prowess, and described each of them, especially <i>Arjuna</i> (“it was by him that <i>Bhīṣma, Droṇa</i>, and <i>Duryodhana</i> were vanquished”). <i>Virāṭa</i>, thinking he had offended <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, offered to bestow his daughter <i>Uttarā</i> on <i>Arjuna</i>, which was applauded by <i>Uttara</i>, and offered his whole kingdom, etc., to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna</i> accepted <i>Uttarā</i> as his daughter-in-law, saying that such an alliance between the <i>Matsyas</i> and the <i>Bharatas</i> was desirable (IV, <b>71</b>). Asked by <i>Virāṭa</i> why he himself did not wish to accept his daughter as wife, <i>Arjuna</i> alleged that she had confided in him as her father, and people might entertain suspicions against her or him; by accepting her for <i>Abhimanyu</i> he attested her purity. <i>Virāṭa</i> approved of it, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> gave his assent; the latter sent invitations to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc., and so did <i>Virāṭa</i>. The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> took up their abode at <i>Upaplavya. Arjuna</i> brought over <i>Abhimanyu</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and many <i>Daśārhas</i> from the <i>Ānartta</i> country. The <i>Kāśi</i>king and <i>Śaibya</i> (friendly to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>) came, each accompanied by an <i>akṣauhiṇī</i> of troops; <i>Yajñasena</i> came there with the sons of <i>Draupadī</i> and <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> came with an <i>akṣauhiṇī</i>. All the kings that came there were lords of <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i> and performers of sacrifices, etc. Then came <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (decked with garlands), <i>Balarāma</i>, etc., with <i>Abhimanyu</i> and his mother. And <i>Indrasena</i>, etc., having lived at <i>Dvārakā</i> for a whole year, came with the chariots of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. In the train of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> came also 10,000 elephants, 100 thousands of horses, 100 millions of chariots, 100 milliards of foot soldiers, and innumerable <i>Vṛṣṇi</i>, <i>Andhaka</i>, and <i>Bhoja</i> warriors. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> gave to each of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> numerous female slaves, etc. Then the nuptial festival set in (description). The matrons of the <i>Matsyas</i> were headed by <i>Sudeṣṇā</i>; but <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> was the foremost in beauty, etc. <i>Virāṭa</i> gave [as dowry] 7,000 horses and 200 elephants, and much wealth, and offered his kingdom, etc., to the <i>Pāṇḍavas. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> gave all the wealth that had been brought by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc., to the brahmans (IV, <b>72</b>)."
