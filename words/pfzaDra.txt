He did penance at Kurukṣetra and attained Svarga. (Śloka 11, Chapter 20, Aśvamedha Parva). <dvsn n='NI'/>Even from boyhood Pṛṣadhra started practice of penance. He got disgusted with life even from his boyhood. A story is told how it happened so. Once when Pṛṣadhra was studying under his Guru, a tiger entered the shed of the cows at night. Hearing the pitiable wails of the cow he went to the shed with his sword and gave a strong and fatal cut to the tiger with it. Unfortunately the stroke fell on the cow instead of the tiger and not knowing the truth in the darkness Pṛṣadhra went and slept peacefully. In the morning when he went to the shed he found the cow lying dead with his sword-cut. He then knew the mistake he had made at night and was so distressed with the accident that he at once left for Kurukṣetra and started doing penance there."

The brahmin boy rushed at it and struck the lion with a sword. But due to want of proper light the sword-cut fell on the cow and the cow fell down dead. The next day the Guru finding the cow lying dead mistook it for a deliberate killing by his disciple and cursed Pṛṣadhra to death. to be born as a Śūdra. When Pṛṣadhra was thus roaming about in the forests in his cursed form he fell into a big forest fire and was burnt to death. (Chapter 2, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa; Chapter 1, Aṃśa 4, Viṣṇu Purāṇa)."
