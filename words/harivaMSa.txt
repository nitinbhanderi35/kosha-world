It contains three parts called respectively Harivaṃśa Parva, Viṣṇu Parva, and Bhaviṣya Parva. Creation of the world, kings of the solar dynasty and of the lunar dynasty, Yadu dynasty and the birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa form the theme of Harivaṃśa Parva. Viṣṇu Parva deals mainly with the pranks and games of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in his childhood. Though there occur certain hints about the future at the beginning of the Bhaviṣya Parva, the creation of the world, the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Vāmana (Dwarf) and as Narasiṃha (half man and half lion), Śiva and Viṣṇu constitute its main theme. <dvsn n='NI'/>The following verses prove that the Harivaṃśa also was composed by Vyāsa. <Poem>Harivaṃśastataḥ parvapurāṇaṃ khilasaṃjñitam / Viṣṇuparvaśi śoścaryā Visṇoḥkaṃsavadhastathā // Bhaviṣyam parvacāpyuktaṃ Khileṣvevādbhutaṃ mahat/ Etat parvaśatam pūrṇam Vyāsenoktaṃ mahātmanā //</Poem> (Ādi Parva, Chapter 2, Verses 83-84)."
