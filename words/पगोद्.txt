            "content": "<i>pagod, pagoda</i>¦ (EI 8-8), also called ‘star pagoda’; English name of the gold coin called <i>hūn (hon)</i> or <i>varāha;</i> probably so called because the coins often bore the representation of a temple called <i>pagod</i> or <i>pagoda</i> by the early European travellers. The word seems to have been derived from Sanskrit <i>bhagavat</i> or <i>bhagavatī</i> meaning the deities worshipped in the temples and also often figuring on the coins. Cf. ‘<i>ṭaṅkakas</i> stamped with the figure of the <i>Bhagavat</i>’ (Bhandarkar's List, No. 2033). <dvsn n='P'><i>Cf. Cīna-pagoda</i> (SII 12), ‘the Chinese temple’; name of a Buddhist shrine at Nāgapaṭṭanam."
