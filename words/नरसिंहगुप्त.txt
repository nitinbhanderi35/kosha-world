But the correct reading of the name of her mother is Śrī Candradevī, on his seal.<sup>103</sup> In No. 50. L. 6 we find his mother's name as ‘Vatsadevī’. In No. 49 he is mentioned as the father of Kumāragupta III. No. 38 describes the issuer of this seal, Viṣṇugupta, as the son and successor of Kumāragupta III, who in his turn was the son and successor of Narasiṃhagupta. <dvsn n='P'/>Narasiṃha is the name of Viṣṇu in his fourth incarnation (Avatāra), half man and half lion who slew the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu and saved the life of Prahlāda.<sup>104</sup>"
