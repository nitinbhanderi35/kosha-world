But he died after his marriage. With this calamity Nandabhadra became a man of abstinence and began to try to acquire spiritual knowledge. After a while a seven-year-old boy appeared before the Vaiśya and quenched his thirst for spiritual knowledge. Later with meditation on Śiva and the Sun, Nandabhadra attained heaven. (Skanda Purāṇa, Chapters 1, 2 and 46)."
