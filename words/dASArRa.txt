An ancient country, famous in the Purāṇas. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>General information.</i> This country had been divided into two, Eastern Daśārṇa and Western Daśārṇa. The modern Patna and the surrounding places comprised Eastern Daśārṇa and the places of Malva, the Western Daśārṇa. Some are of opinion that Daśārṇa comprises the South-East part of the Vindhya mountain. It is mentioned in ‘Meghadūta’ that Vidiśā was the capital of Daśārṇa. The modern name of Vidiśā is Bhilsā. <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) <i>Other information regarding Daśārṇa.</i> <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 112, Stanza 25, that once Pāṇḍu brought the country of Vidiśā under subjugation. <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) At another time Bhīmasena conquered the country of Daśārṇa. (Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 29, Stanza 5). <dvsn n='NI'/>(3) Nakula once conquered this country. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 32, Stanza 7). <dvsn n='NI'/>(4) King Sudāmā ruled over the country of Daśārṇa. He had two daughters. Bhīma, the king of Vidarbha married the first one and Vīrabāhu the king of Cedi married the second daughter. Damayantī was the daughter of Bhīma. A daughter named Sunandā was born to Vīrabāhu. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 69). <dvsn n='NI'/>(5) Before the battle of Bhārata, Hiraṇyavarmā was the King of Daśārṇa. Śikhaṇḍinī the daughter of Drupada went in the guise of a male and married the daughter of Hiraṇyavarmā. The king of Daśārṇa who had been deceived thus, attacked Drupada. But the problem was solved because Śikhaṇḍinī actually became a male. (See the word Aṃbā). (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 41). <dvsn n='NI'/>(6) The king of Daśārṇa took the side of the Kauravas in the battle of Bhārata. (M.B.
