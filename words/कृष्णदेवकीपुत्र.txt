            "content": "3. <b>Kṛṣṇa Devakī-putra</b>¦ is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>1</sup> as a pupil of the mythical <b>Ghora Āṅgirasa.</b> Tradition,<sup>2</sup> and several modern writers like Grierson, Garbe, and von Schroeder, recognize in him the hero Kṛṣṇa, who later is deified. In their view he is a Kṣatriya teacher of morals, as opposed to Brahminism.<sup>3</sup> This is extremely doubtful. It appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of Euhemerism. To identify this Kṛṣṇa with the preceding, as does the St. Petersburg Dictionary, seems to be quite groundless. <F>1) iii. 17, 6.</F> <F>2) <i>Cf.</i> Weber, <i>Indian Literature,</i> 169.</F> <F>3) Von Schroeder, <i>Vienna Oriental</i> <i>Journal,</i> 19, 414, 415; Grierson, <i>Encyclo-</i> <i>padia of Religions,</i> article ‘Bhakti’; Garbe, <i>Bhagavadgītā.</i> <dvsn n='P'/><i>Cf.</i> Weber, <i>op. cit.,</i> 71; 148; Hopkins, <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,</i> 1905, 386.</F>"
