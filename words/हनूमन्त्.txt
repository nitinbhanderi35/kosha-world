firm like mountain Himavant (<i>himavantam iva sthitam</i> 3. 264. 10); also 3. 146. 65-71. <b>C.</b> Eminence: Mentioned as chief or excellent among the monkeys: <i>kapīśvara</i> 3. 148. 1; <i>vānarādhipati</i> 3. 146. 64;

3. 264. 10, 23; 3. 266. 65; he specially became friendly with Sugrīva 3. 147. 26. <b>E.</b> Meeting with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in search of heavenly lotus flowers having heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his conch near the thicket of banana trees; hearing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he hit the ground with his large tail which looked like the flag staff of Indra and produced sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched forward to search the source of this sound he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stoneslab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146. 59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 6571; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke him up who was happily asleep; he told Bhīma that as an intelligent human being Bhīma should have shown compassion for other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know his <i>dharma;</i> Hanūmant then asked Bhīma the purpose of his arriving at a place which was not supposed to be visited by human beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could not be crossed unless one had acquired perfection (<i>siddhagati</i> 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits to be found there which were as good as <i>amṛta</i> and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather than proceed further and meet with danger; when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed and for that purpose Hanūmant should get away from his path, Hanūmant replied that it was not possible for him to move as he was suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must proceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma said he was prepared to go beyond him and the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant was his brother, meritorious, brave and intelligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he could not move due to old age Bhīma should set aside his tail from the path and proceed; Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail and stood with his face turned down due to shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant to reveal his identity and let him know whether he was a <i>siddha,</i> a god, a Gandharva, or a Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147. 17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he really was and that he used to live with Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin 3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma that he had gone out with other crores of monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had then jumped over the ocean, one hundred <i>yojanas</i> wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house, and returned after announcing himself to Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the narrative of Rāma (<i>tasya vīrasya caritam</i> 3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant again told Bhīma that no mortal could go beyond the point where they met since it was frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the should be attacked or cursed by some one, and that the lake he was searching for was close by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant that he was highly blessed by his meeting with Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the unrivalled form which he had assumed when he leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would believe what Hanūmant had told about himself; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was not possible to assume forms of the bygone age; one acquired the strength, form and prowess according to the <i>yuga</i> in which one lived; he had to follow the (rule of the) <i>yuga,</i> since no one could go beyond Time (<i>yuge yuge / bala-</i> <i>varṣmaprabhāvā hi prahīyanty udbhavanti</i> <i>ca … yugaṃ samanuvartāmi kālo hi dura-</i> <i>tikramaḥ</i> 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted in his request, Hanūmant increased his body immensely to look like mountain Maināka and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant told Bhīma that he could grow even more, as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3. 149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rāvaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā, Hanūmant told him that if he had killed Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3. 149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma to depart and showed him the way leading to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the flowers himself and asked him to show regard for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act rashly but follow the <i>dharma</i> 3. 149. 21-24; Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on <i>dharma</i> to Bhīma (explaining to him <i>trayī,</i> <i>vārtā</i> and <i>daṇḍanīti;</i> the duties of the four <i>varṇas;</i> the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52; Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue; with faltering voice and tears in his eyes Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanūmant that he (H.) had already done all that he could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour; the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their support which would help them to win the war; hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to brotherly feelings and friendliness (<i>bhrātṛtvāt</i> <i>sauhṛdāc cāpi</i> 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his roar to it and increase its volume; he would stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar which would deprive the enemies of their lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described as marked by a monkey (<i>vānara, kapi,</i> <i>śākhāmṛga,</i> but the monkey is not named Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7, 9, 20, 27; 6. 67. 3; 6. 78. 9; 6. 112. 114; 7. 9. 14; 7. 17. 21; 7. 80. 8, 9 (the monkey terrified the army of the Kauravas); 7. 80. 29; 7. 102. 6; 7. 114. 81; 9. 9. 59; 10. 12. 25; 14. 51. 54; 14. 82. 29; 14. 83. 12, 23. so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150. 14-15. <b>F.</b> Meeting with Rāma and the fight between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśyamūka mountain and saw five monkeys, Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva, approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first talked with Hanūmant and then approached Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264. 9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33. <b>G.</b> Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā, when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on way they rested in the <i>madhuvana;</i> Sugrīva interpreted this behaviour (<i>praṇaya</i> 3. 266. 28) as indicating that Hanūmant and others were successful in their mission; the monkeychiefs who had gone for the search then approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva 3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed Rāma that he had brought the good tidings; he then described to Rāma his search for Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṃpāti and obtaining from him the information that Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu: <i>tataḥ pitaram āviśya pupluve 'haṃ māhār-</i> <i>ṇavam</i>) and killing on way an acquatic Rākṣasī (<i>jalarākṣasī</i>) 3. 266. 57; in Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner apartment of Rāvaṇa (<i>tatra sītā mayā</i> <i>dṛṣṭā rāvaṇāntaḥpure satī</i> 3. 266. 58); having determined her identity Hanūmant approached her and told her that he was the son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma; he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being; he assured her that he was a monkey and not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told him that she knew him already to be Hanūmant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma 3. 266. 58-68. <b>H.</b> Encounter with individual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa: Hanūmant marched at the head of the army when it started towards the sea in the south 3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanūmant rushed towards him; this act inspired confidence in the monkeys; the fight between the two was fierce like the one between Indra and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant with maces (<i>gadā</i>) and clubs (<i>parigha</i>), and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7, 12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in fighting with the demons Vajravega and and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajravega and killed him with the summit of a mountain (<i>adriśṛṅga</i>) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant was among the monkey-chiefs who watched over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell down on the ground tied with the arrows of Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes which enabled them to see invisible beings 3. 273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkeychiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at Rāma 3. 274. 3. <b>I.</b> Sītā's boon: At the time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave Hanūmant the following boon: “You will live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts (<i>rāma-</i> <i>kīrtyā samaṃ putra jīvitaṃ te bhavīṣyati</i>), and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait on you” 3. 275. 43-44. <b>J.</b> Messenger to Bharata: When Rāma approached the city of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as his messenger to give him the good news (of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3. 275. 59-60."
