This is done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may be turned into a feminine and compounded with <i>pūrṇa-māsa,</i> ‘the full moon,’ as in <i>Tiṣyā-pūrṇamāsa,</i> ‘the full moon in the Nakṣatra Tiṣya.’<sup>103</sup> Much more often, however, it is turned into a derivative adjective, used with <i>paurṇamāsī,</i> ‘the full moon (night),’ or with <i>amāvāsyā,</i> ‘the new moon (night),’ as in <i>Phālgunī paurṇamāsī,</i> ‘the full-moon night in the Nakṣatra Phalgunī’;<sup>104</sup> or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the Nakṣatra adjective alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month itself is called by a name derived<sup>105</sup> from that of a Nakṣatra, but only Phālguna,<sup>106</sup> Caitra,<sup>107</sup> Vaiśākha,<sup>108</sup> Taiṣya,<sup>109</sup> Māgha<sup>110</sup> occur in the Brāhmaṇas, the complete list later being Phālguna, Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyaiṣṭha, Āṣāḍha, Śrāvaṇa, Prauṣṭhapada, Āśvayuja, Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Taiṣya, Māgha. Strictly speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa there was a tendency to equate lunar months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up the solar year (see <b>Māsa</b>). <dvsn n='P'/><i>The Nakṣatras and Chronology.</i> — (1) An endeavour has been made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at which the systematic employment of those names was introduced. Sir William Jones<sup>111</sup> refers to this possibility, and Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber<sup>112</sup> considered that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but Whitney<sup>113</sup> has convincingly shown that it is an impossible feat, and Thibaut<sup>114</sup> concurs in this view. Twelve became fixed as the number of the months because of the desire, evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon can have no chronological significance, because full moon at no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly recurrent intervals. <dvsn n='P'/>(2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with Aśvinī, and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star <lang n='greek'>ζ</lang> Piscium on the border of Revatī and Aśvinī,<sup>115</sup> say in the course of the sixth century A.D. Weber<sup>116</sup> has therefore accepted the view that the Kṛttikās were chosen for a similar reason, and the date at which that Nakṣatra coincided with the vernal equinox has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C.<sup>117</sup> A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut<sup>118</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>119</sup> have pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the equinox with the Kṛttikās. Jacobi<sup>120</sup> has contended that in the Rigveda<sup>121</sup> the commencement of the rains and the summer solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the old, and that further the new year began with the summer solstice in Phalgunī.<sup>121</sup> He has also referred to the distinction of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup> as supporting his view of the connexion of the sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory: the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except by translating the word <i>dvādaśa</i><sup>123</sup> as ‘the twelfth (month)’ instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It may further be mentioned that even if the Nakṣatra of Kṛttikās be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with the vernal equinox, both Whitney<sup>124</sup> and Thibaut<sup>125</sup> are prepared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date given by the Jyotiṣa, which puts the winter solstice in Māgha. <dvsn n='P'/>(3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a Brāhmaṇa text, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>126</sup> expressly places it in the new moon of Māgha (<i>māghasyāmāvāsyāyām</i>). It is not very important whether we take this with the commentators<sup>127</sup> as the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch in the following way. If the end of Revatī marked the vernal equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha, when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of Śraviṣṭhās. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from Śraviṣṭhās, and the difference between that and the beginning of Aśvinī= 1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)° (27 asterisms being = 360°). Taking the starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Varāha Mihira, Jones<sup>128</sup> arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha — that is, on the basis of 1° = 72 years as the precession. Pratt<sup>129</sup> arrived at precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas of the junction star<sup>130</sup> of Maghā, <lang n='greek'>α</lang> Leonis or Regulus. Davis<sup>131</sup> and Colebrooke<sup>132</sup> arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citrā, which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as 3° in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation in the Jyotiṣa,<sup>133</sup> it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)° extent each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether out of their asterisms.<sup>134</sup> Nor can we say that the star <lang n='greek'>ζ</lang> Piscium early formed the eastern boundary of Revatī; it may possibly not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revatī. Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point — 582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants<sup>135</sup> — is the fact that the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determinable by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate observers, since they made no precise determination of the number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotiṣa they do not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even the Sūrya Siddhānta<sup>136</sup> does not know the precession of the equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years for possible errors,<sup>137</sup> and the only probable conclusion to be drawn from the datum of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa is that it was recording an observation which must have been made some centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the probable date of the Brāhmaṇa literature,<sup>138</sup> say B.C. 800-600. <dvsn n='P'/>(4) Another chronological argument has been derived from the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year, since the full moon in Phalgunī is often described as the ‘mouth (<i>mukham</i>) of the year.’<sup>139</sup> Jacobi<sup>140</sup> considers that this was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg<sup>141</sup> and Thibaut,<sup>142</sup> on the other hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence<sup>143</sup> of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring: as we have seen above in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, the new moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice,<sup>144</sup> which puts the full moon of Phalgunī at a month and a half after the winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with the February 7 of the <i>veris initium</i> in the Roman Calendar. This fact accords with the only natural division of the year into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see <b>Cāturmāsya</b>). Tilak,<sup>145</sup> on the other hand, holds that the winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī and Caitrī in early periods — viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 60004000. <dvsn n='P'/>(5) The passages of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>146</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>147</sup> which treat the full moon in Phālguna as the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of spring,<sup>148</sup> and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another alternative is the Ekāṣṭakā, interpreted by the commentators as the eighth day after the full moon in Maghās, a time which might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old year, well be considered as representing the end of the year. A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full moon meant must be that of Caitra, as Ālekhana quoted by Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes.<sup>149</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>(6) Others, again, according to the Gṛhya ritual, began the year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name Āgrahāyaṇa<sup>150</sup> (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’). Jacobi and Tilak<sup>151</sup> think that this one denoted the autumn equinox in Mṛgaśiras, corresponding to the winter solstice in Phalgunī. But, as Thibaut<sup>152</sup> shows clearly, it was selected as the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra instead of Phālguna.<sup>153</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>(7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler,<sup>154</sup> from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the Gṛhya Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the rains (as in the Buddhist <i>vassā</i>) which mark the summer solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadrapadās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney<sup>155</sup> has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the rains and learning — a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred because of its connexion with the word Śravaṇa, ‘ear’ — and in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so to coincide.<sup>156</sup> <dvsn n='P'/><i>The Origin of the Nakṣatras.</i> — As we have seen, there is no evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās the full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians show (see <b>Graha</b>) a remarkably small knowledge of the other astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus impossible <i>a priori</i> to deny that the Vedic Indians could have invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac.<sup>157</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old Testament<sup>158</sup> may really be the lunar mansions.<sup>159</sup> That the Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess<sup>160</sup> held, is, on the other hand, not at all probable. <dvsn n='P'/>Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers published by him between 1839 and 1861,<sup>161</sup> attempted to prove the derivation of the Nakṣatra from the Chinese Sieou. The latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all. He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars observed in the neighbourhood can be referred; they were, as regards twenty-four of them, selected about B.C. 2357 on account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with Mao (= Kṛttikās), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357. Weber,<sup>162</sup> in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory, and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third century B.C. The last point does not appear<sup>163</sup> to be correct, but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were reinforced by Whitney,<sup>164</sup> who insisted that Biot's supposition of the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold de Saussure,<sup>165</sup> , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg,<sup>166</sup> who has also pointed out<sup>167</sup> that the series does not begin with Mao (= Kṛttikās). <dvsn n='P'/>There remains only the possibility that a common source for all the three sets — Nakṣatra, Manāzil, and Sieou — may be found in Babylonia. Hommel<sup>168</sup> has endeavoured to show that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the Pleiades (= Kṛttikās); but Thibaut's researches<sup>169</sup> are not favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber,<sup>170</sup> Whitney,<sup>171</sup> Zimmer,<sup>172</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>173</sup> all incline to the view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system, and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the Ādityas,<sup>174</sup> and possibly the word <b>Manā.</b> <F>103) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 10, 1. <i>Cf.</i> vii. 4, 8, 1. 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 9, 1.</F> <F>104) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 3. 11 <i>et seq.;</i> vi. 2, 2, 18; xiii. 4, 1, 4; Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; iv. 4; v. 1.

The passage is apparently not in Caland's manuscripts, or he would have mentioned it in his paper, <i>Über das vituelle Sūtra</i> <i>des Baudhāyana,</i> 36, 37.

The assumption of the scholiasts seems to be due to the fact that to their minds a month must end with a new moon (<i>amānta</i>) or with full moon (<i>pūrṇimānta</i>). But there is no reason to say that in Vedic times the month may not have commenced with the new moon; the Kauṣītaki passage would thus be quite satisfactorily explained.</F> <F>128) <i>Asiatic Researches,</i> 2, 393.</F> <F>129) <i>Journal of the Asiatic Society of</i> <i>Bengal,</i> 31, 49.</F> <F>130) <i>Cf.</i> Whitney, <i>Oriental and Linguistic</i> <i>Essays,</i> 2, 373.</F> <F>131) <i>Asiatic Researches,</i> 2, 268; 5, 288.</F> <F>132) <i>Essays,</i> 1, 109, 110.

The word does not occur in the literature anterior to the Gṛhya Sūtras, and it must remain an undecided question whether the practice was or was not old. Jacobi urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and that it must originally have referred to a real fixed pole star, and he thinks that such a star could only be found in the third millennium B.C. Whitney and Oldenberg definitely reject this view on the ground that too much must not be made out of a piece of folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual requirements would be satisfied by any star of some magnitude which was approximately polar. This conclusion seems convincing. <i>Cf.</i> Keith, <i>Journal</i> <i>of the Royal Asiatic Society,</i> 1909, 1102; 1910, 465; <i>contra,</i> Jacobi, <i>ibid.,</i> 1909, 726 <i>et seq.;</i> 1910, 464. (2) The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts that the Kṛttikās do not move from the eastern quarter, which the others do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi, <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,</i> 1910, 463, 464) upon this assertion as giving a date of the third millennium B.C. for the Śatapatha observation. But this notice is quite inadequate to support any such result, and its lack of trustworthiness as a chronological guide is increased by the fact that the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xviii 5, has a similar notice, coupled with another notice, which, according to Barth, would only be true somewhere in or after the sixth century A.D., the equatorial point being placed between Citrā and Svātī, which in the early period were both very much north of the equator (see Caland, <i>Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana,</i> 37-39). The same passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the Mādhyaṃdina recension, states that the number of the Kṛttikās is greater than that of the stars in any of the other Nakṣatras, which consist of one, two, three, or four stars, or which, according to the Kāṇva recension (see Eggeling, <i>Sacred Books of the East,</i> 12, 282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not possible to put much faith in this assertion, for Hasta later has five stars, and its name (with reference to the fingers) suggests five (<i>cf.</i> Weber, <i>Naxatra,</i> 2, 368, 381), and that number is possibly referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10). See Geldner, <i>Vedische Studien,</i> 3, 177. (3) Attempts have been made to regard the names of the Nakṣatras as significant of their position in the list. Thus Bentley, <i>Historical View,</i> 2, thought Viśākhā was so called because the equinoctial colure divided the equator about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by Tilak, <i>Orion,</i> 57 <i>et seq.</i> Jyeṣṭhaghnī has been interpreted as ‘slaying the eldest’ — <i>i.e.,</i> as marking the new year by putting an end to the old year. Tilak, 90, suggests that Mūla was so called because its acronycal rising marked the beginning of the year when the vernal equinox was near Mṛgaśiras. More probable is Whitney's view, <i>Sārya</i> <i>Siddhānta,</i> 194, that it was the most southern, and so, as it were, the basis of the asterisms.</F> <F>157) Max Müller, <i>Rigveda,</i> 4^2, xliv <i>et seq.,</i> maintains the Indian origin of the system. Thrbaut, <i>Astronomie, Astrologie</i> <i>und Mathematik,</i> 14, 15, admits it to be possible, as does Whitney, <i>Oriental and</i> <i>Linguistic Essays,</i> 2, 418.</F> <F>158) 2 Kings xxiii. 5; Job xxxviii. 32.</F> <F>159) Weber, <i>Naxatra,</i> 1, 317, 318; Whitney, <i>op, cit.,</i> 359.</F> <F>160) <i>Journal of the American Oriental</i> <i>Society,</i> 8, 309-334. This was Weber's view also, according to Whitney, 413 <i>et seq.;</i> but Weber himself disclaimed it (see <i>Indische Studien,</i> 9, 425, 426; 10, 246, 247).

Weber, <i>Nakṣatra,</i> 2, 362, 400, laid great stress on the fact that the Jyotiṣa, 8, referred to the difference of the longest and shortest day as being six <i>muhūrtas,</i> which makes the longest day fourteen hours twenty-four minutes: and he compared the Babylonian day of fourteen hours twenty-five minutes, and a Chinese day of fourteen hours twentyfour minutes. But Whitney, <i>Oriental</i> <i>and Linguistic Essays,</i> 2, 417, 418, shows that no stress can be laid on this argument, since the correspondence is only approximate, and the latitudes of the Babylonian and Chinese observations are approximately the same.</F> <F>171) See <i>op. cit.,</i> 2, 418-420.</F> <F>172) <i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 356, 357, where he is quite confident of the Semitic origin of the Nakṣatras.</F> <F>173) <i>Op. cit.,</i> 572.</F> <F>174) For the flood, see Zimmer, <i>op. cit.,</i> 101, 357, who is opposed to Weber's view (<i>Indische Studien,</i> 1, 160; <i>Indische</i> <i>Streifen,</i> 1, 11) that the story preserves an old Āryan tradition, and a reminiscence of the home of the Indians beyond the Himālaya (<i>cf.</i> Muir, <i>Sanskrit</i> <i>Texts,</i> 1^2, 190; 2^2, 323, n. 96; Lassen, <i>Indische Alterthumskunde,</i> 1^2, 638, and <i>cf.</i> Oldenberg, <i>Religion des Veda,</i> 276, n. 3). For the Ādityas, see Oldenberg, <i>Religion des Veda,</i> 185 <i>et seq.; Zeitschrift</i> <i>der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell-</i> <i>schaft,</i> 50, 43 <i>et seq.</i> His view is not accepted by Macdonell, <i>Vedic Mythology,</i> p. 44; Bloomfield, <i>Religion of the Veda,</i> 133. Still more doubtful is Zimmer's view (<i>Altindisches Leben,</i> 363, 364) of the division of day and night into thirty parts, which he sees in Rv. i. 123, 8, and which he thinks is based on the Babylonian division of the same period of time into sixtieths. <i>Cf.</i> also V. Smith, <i>Indian Antiquary,</i> 34, 230, who argues, but inconclusively, that the use of iron was introduced from Babylonia. <dvsn n='P'/>The facts about the Nakṣatras are (with the exception of the data from the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra) collected in Weber's second essay, <i>Die vedischen Nachrichten</i> <i>von den Naxatra,</i> 1861. The first essay, 1860, deals with the problem of origins. See also his discussions in <i>Indische</i> <i>Studien,</i> 9, 424 <i>et seq.;</i> 10, 213 <i>et seq.</i> Whitney's work lies partly in his scientific determination (in many places correcting Colebrooke's discoveries) of the later Naxatras in his edition and version of the Sūrya Siddhānta (<i>Journal</i> <i>of the American Oriental Society,</i> 6), and partly in his discussions of the question of origin (<i>Journal of the American Oriental</i> <i>Society,</i> 8), <i>Oriental and Linguistic Essays,</i> 2, 341-421 (with a stellar chart), and of the question of date as against Jacobi and Tilak's <i>Orion</i> (<i>Journal of</i> <i>the American Oriental Society,</i> 16, lxxxii <i>et seq.</i>). The views of Max Müller are found in his <i>Rigveda,</i> 4^2, xxxiv <i>et seq.</i> The modern discussion of the dates inferable from the Nakṣatra was inaugurated by Jacobi (1893) in the <i>Festgruss an Roth,</i> 68-74 (translated in the <i>Indian Antiquary,</i> 23). See also his articles in the <i>Nachrichten der königl.</i> <i>Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göt-</i> <i>tingen,</i> 1894, 110 <i>et seq.; Zeitschrift der</i> <i>Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft,</i> 49, 218 <i>et seq.;</i> 50, 70 <i>et seq.; Journal</i> <i>of the Royal Asiatic Society,</i> 1909, 721727. Independently Tilak, in his <i>Orion,</i> developed similar views; but most of his special points are disposed of by Whitney in his review cited above. Oldenberg has discussed and refuted Jacobi's arguments in the <i>Zeitschrift,</i> 48, 629 <i>et seq.;</i> 49, 470 <i>et seq.;</i> 50, 450 <i>et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic</i> <i>Society,</i> 1909, 1090 <i>et seq.</i> Thibaut has also rejected Jacobi's views in an article in the <i>Indian Antiquary,</i> 24, 85 <i>et seq.</i> See also his <i>Astronomie, Astrologie und</i> <i>Mathematik,</i> 17-19. The recent literature on the origin of the Nakṣatras consists of articles by Thibaut, <i>Journa</i> <i>of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,</i> 63, 144 <i>et seq.;</i> Saussure, <i>Toung Pao,</i> 1909, 121 <i>et seq.;</i> 255 <i>et seq.;</i> Oldenberg, <i>Nachrichten der königl.
