In order to purify himself of the sin of brahmanicide he interrogated many brahmans, and wandered from country to country over the whole earth. One day he met <i>Indrota Śaunaka</i>, who rebuked him for his brahmanicide and reminded him of the messengers of <i>Yama</i> in the abode of <i>Yama</i> (XII, <b>150</b>). <i>Janamejaya</i> meekly listened to the reproof, saying that he was much afraid of <i>Yama</i>; he knew that, according to the Vedas, wretches like himself had forfeited all claim to the respect of the world, and had after death to dwell in hell like <i>Pulindas</i> and <i>Śabaras</i> (so C. and B.; PCR. <i>Khasas</i>), and he sought instruction from <i>Indrota</i>, who told him to repent and, knowing the Vedas, etc., act in such a way that the brahmans might not be angry with him; <i>Śaunaka</i> said that his kinsmen and friends would call him sinful because he instructed <i>Janamejaya. Janamejaya</i> swore never again to injure the brahmans (XII, <b>151</b>). <i>Indrota</i> discoursed to the repentant king on the means of cleansing himself, quoting a verse sung by <i>Yayāti</i> about the sacredness of <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, etc. (α), and recommending him to go to <i>Mahāsaras</i>, etc. (β), quoting also a saying of <i>Manu</i> and a verse of <i>Satyavat</i>. <i>Mahāsaras</i>, etc. (γ), are so sacred that one guilty of fœticide becomes cleansed at even 100 yojanas from them. <i>Manu</i> has said that by diving in water after thrice reciting the <i>Agha-</i> <i>marṣaṇa [mantras]</i> (v. the note of PCR., p. 498), one reaps the fruits of the final bath in a horse-sacrifice. The gods and <i>Asuras</i> in days of yore were instructed by M.-ṛ. <i>Bṛhaspati</i>, the preceptor of the gods, how one should cleanse himself from sin. <i>Indrota</i> then assisted <i>Janamejaya</i>, cleansed of his sins, in the horse-sacrifice (XII, <b>152</b>)."
