The glow thus released by Viśvakarman fell on the earth and Viśvakarman made with that glow the cakra (disc) of Viṣṇu, the triśūla (trident) of Siva the Puṣpaka, aerial chariot of Kubera and the Śakti of Subrahmaṇya.

            "content": "ŚAKTI III¦. The sound ‘Ś’ means welfare or prosperity and ‘kti’ prowess. Therefore Śakti means she, who is the embodiment of prosperity and prowess or she, who grants prosperity and prowess. The definition of ‘Bhagavatī’ is, she who combines in herself knowledge affluence, wealth, reputation, power and the female organ. Therefore the word ‘Śakti’ may be taken to mean Bhagavatī and Pārvatī, and what are termed as Bhagavatī, Śakti, Devī, Ambikā, Pārvatī etc. are the manifestations of Śakti, Śiva's spouse. This Śakti exists fractionally in all Devas. When, once upon a time the devāsura war broke out the Śaktis of Devas like Brahmā emerged to help Caṇḍikā. The vehicle, ornaments, weapon etc. of each Deva, his Devī also possessed. The Śaktis (Devīs) of the Devas appeared in the following manner. Brahmāṇī, wife of Brahmā, rode on the swan wearing beads around her neck and holding the water-vessel in her hands. She was followed by Vaiṣṇavī Viṣṇu's Śakti on Garuḍa wearing yellow clothes and with the conch, disc, lotus etc. in her hands. Śāṅkarī Śiva's Śakti rode on the ox with the crescent moon and serpents as ornaments and holding in her hands the Śūla. ‘Kaumārī’, Subrahmaṇya's Śakti rode on Airāvata with śūla in hands. The Śakti called ‘Vārāhī in the form of a great boar rode carrying a corpse, Nārasiṃhī’ Śakti took the form of narasiṃha (half man and half lion). Yāmyā, Yama's śakti, rode on buffalo holding in her hands a long stick. Śaktis called Kauberī and Vāruṇī took their respective forms and in this manner all the Śaktis came to the help of Devī. This sight pleased not only the Devas, but the mother of the universe also. Along with them incarnated on earth Śaṃkara, who gives ‘śaṃ’ (happiness) to the world and blessed Caṇḍikā on the battle-field (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th and 9th Skandhas)."
