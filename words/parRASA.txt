            "content": "PARṆĀŚĀ¦. A river of western Bhārata. This river sits in the court of Varuṇa in the form of a nymph. (Śloka 9, Chapter 1, Sabhā Parva). Śrutāyudha, a valiant soldier who fought against Arjuna in the great Kurukṣetra battle was the son of Parṇāsā. Varuṇa was the father of Śrutāyudha and at the time of the birth of a son for her she requested Varuṇa to grant her a boon that her son would not be killed by anybody. Varuṇa while granting her the boon gave the son a mace. That mace had a peculiarity. If the mace was used against anybody who was not fighting, the mace would turn back and kill the user. With the help of that mace Śrutāyudha gave Arjuna a fierce fight and in the midst of the heat he forgot the condition stipulated by Varuṇa and used it against Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was standing nearby watching their fight. The mace turned back and killed Śrutāyudha. (Chapter 92, Droṇa Parva)."
