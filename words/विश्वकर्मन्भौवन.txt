He is said in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to have been consecrated by <b>Kaśyapa,</b> to whom he offered the earth (<i>i.e.,</i> presumably a piece of land) as a sacrificial fee; in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he performed the Sarvamedha (‘universal sacrifice’), and made a similar offer; in both cases the earth refused to be given. The story seems to contain a reference to the early dislike of gifts of land,<sup>3</sup> but it cannot be stated with certainty that this is the meaning. <dvsn n='P'/>^1 viii. 21, 8. <F>2) xiii. 7, 1, 15.</F> <F>3) Rhys Davids, <i>Buddhist India,</i> 47. <dvsn n='P'/><i>Cf.</i> Eggeling, <i>Sacred Books of the East,</i> 44, 421, n, 1; Muir, <i>Sanskrit Texts,</i> 1^2, 456, 457.</F>"
