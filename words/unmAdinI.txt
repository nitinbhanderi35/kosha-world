Because of the interference of his favourites, the King did not marry her. The King's general married her. Once the King happened to see her by chance. When he saw how beautiful she was, he felt sorry that he did not marry her. From that day onwards the King grew morbidly torpid and finally died. <dvsn n='NI'/>This story was told by Yaugandharāyaṇa, minister of Udayana, the King of Vatsa.
