Bhandarkar<sup>154</sup> takes them to be the Kharparas mentioned in the Batihagadh Inscription<sup>155</sup> of the Damoh district of M.P. Kharpara<sup>156</sup> means a thief, a rogue or a cheat. The name Kharaparika does not occur elsewhere in inscriptions or literature. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>157</sup> mentions a tribe called Khara-sāgara-rāśīs,<sup>158</sup> along with the Gandharas and the Yaudheyas; and the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>159</sup> refers to a country named Kharapatha, watered by the river Nalinī. It is difficult to say whether Khara-sāgara-rāśī and Kharapatha had anything to do with the Kharaparikas.<sup>160</sup> K.P. Jayaswal expresses the probability of the identification of the Kharaparikas with the five Karpaṭas of the Mahābhārata.<sup>161</sup>"
