When Nala was roaming about in the forests after his separation from Damayantī he happened to save the cobra, Kārkoṭaka, from a wild fire. But in return the snake bit him and made him as black as clouds. He then advised Nala to go to the palace of King Ṛtuparṇa where the cobra said, Nala would be taught the secret mantra of Akṣahṛdaya by the King. <dvsn n='NI'/>One who knows this sacred chant can find out all secrets of a game of dice and can count within no time the number of leaves, fruits and flowers on a tree. Nala went to Rṭuparṇa and stayed with him. While living there a brahmin named Sudeva came to Ṛtuparṇa and informed him that Damayantī was going to marry again. Ṛtuparṇa immediately started for Vidarbha taking Nala as his charioteer. The chariot driven by Nala flew like a wind and on the way when Ṛtuparṇa's handkerchief fell down and he requested Nala to stop the chariot. Nala informed him that by the time the request was made they had travelled already one yojana. As they proceeded they saw a huge tree full of leaves and fruits. Ṛtuparṇa at a glance told Nala that the tree contained five crores of leaves and two thousand nine hunḍred and five fruits. Nala was surprised. Then they understood that Nala was able to drive the chariot so quickly because of his knowledge of the sacred chant Aśvahṛdaya and that Ṛtuparṇa was able to count the leaves and fruits because of his knowledge of the chant Akṣahṛdaya. They taught each other the sacred mantras. Because of this Akṣahṛdaya Nala was able to win the game of dice the second time and regain his kingdom. (Chapter 72, Vana Parva)."
