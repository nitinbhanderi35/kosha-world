Asked by the brahmans the mungoose related: The brahman named lived with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law, and practised penances; he used to eat every day at the sixth division; during a famine he had nothing to eat day after day; one day in the month of <i>Jyaiṣṭha</i>, while the sun was in the meridian, he was picking up grains of corn, but got nothing; one day, after the sixth division had come, he obtained a <i>prastha</i> of barley, which they reduced to powder for making <i>saktu</i>; having finished their recitations and libations, etc., they divided the powdered barley among themselves, so that each got a <i>kuḍava</i>; then came a guest, who ate all the portions, the wife, son, and daughter-in-law with difficulty prevailing upon the brahman to give their portions as well. The guest turned out to be <i>Dharma</i>; flowers were rained down from heaven; D.-ṛ, D., G., <i>Devadūtas</i>, etc., and B.-ṛ. standing in <i>vimānas</i> and dwelling in <i>Brahmaloka</i> were struck with wonder; “I have been rescued, and others who have not yet come (<i>anāgatāḥ</i>) have been rescued for countless <i>yugas</i>; he that gives away 100 having 1,000, 10 having 100, and a handful of water having no wealth, are equal in merit,” citing <i>Rantideva (c), Nṛga (d</i>), and <i>Śibi Auśīnara</i>; “thou hast conquered <i>Brahmaloka</i>.” The brahman, with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law, proceeded to heaven on a celestial chariot. The mungoose continued: “I came out of my hole, and by the contact with the powder of barley, etc., my head and half of my body became gold; in order to convert the rest of my body into gold I repeatedly repair to the hermitages of ascetics and to the sacrifices of kings; I came hither with high hopes, but I have not been made into gold.” Then the mungoose disappeared (XIV, <b>90</b>).— That mungoose was <i>Dharma</i>, who having injured <i>Jama-</i> <i>dagni (f</i>) had been cursed by the <i>Pitṛs</i>, but became freed from the curse by disparaging himself in the form of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (XIV, <b>92</b>)."
