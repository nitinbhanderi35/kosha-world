Varuṇa submerged in the ocean all the fortresses built by him and the place for some time remained as a forest-land. (Daśama Skandha, Bhāgavata Kilippāttu). It was after that that Śrī Kṛṣṇa made that land beautiful and called it Dvārakā. The country ruled over by Ānartta was called Ānarttam. During his regime there lived in his land a very great scholar named Vedaratha. (Umeśānavrata, Śiva Purāṇa) See under Vedaratha."
