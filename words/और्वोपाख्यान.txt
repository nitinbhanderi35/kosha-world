After he had ascended to heaven, it came to happen that his descendants were in want of wealth. Knowing that the <i>Bhṛgus</i> were rich, they went to them and begged. Some amongst the <i>Bhṛgus</i> buried their wealth under the earth, some gave it away to <i>brahmans</i>, and some duly gave it to the <i>kṣattriyas</i>. Some <i>kṣattriyas</i>, while digging at the house of a <i>Bhārgava</i>, came upon a large treasure. The <i>kṣattriyas</i> then began to kill the <i>Bhṛgus</i> with their arrows all over the earth, even the embryos. A <i>Bhṛgu</i> woman fled to <i>Himavat</i>, holding an embryo in one of her thighs (“for 100 years,” v. 6822). From fear a <i>brahman</i> woman reported this to the <i>kṣattriyas</i>. The <i>kṣattriyas</i> then went to destroy that embryo, which, however, came out, tearing open the thigh and dazzling the eyes of the <i>kṣattriyas</i> so that they lost their sight. They asked the woman that they might be restored to sight, promising to abstain from their sinful practice (I, <b>178</b>). She told them to ask the child, which they did, and regaining their eyesights they went away. The child (<i>viprarṣi</i>) was named <i>Aurva</i>, because he had been born after tearing open his mother's thigh (<i>ūru). Aurva</i> devoted himself to the austerest of penances with the object of destroying the whole world to gratify his ancestors. The <i>Pitṛs</i> then all came from <i>Pitṛloka</i>, and said: “Be propitious towards the three worlds. Having grown weary with the long periods of life allotted to us, we desired our own destruction through the <i>kṣattriyas</i>. Such as commit suicide never attain to regions that are blessed, therefore we abstained from self-destruction” (I, <b>179</b>). When <i>Aurva</i> replied that his vow must not be in vain, the <i>Pitṛs</i> prevailed upon him to throw his wrath into the waters of the ocean, the whole universe being made of water. It became a large horse-head, which, emitting fire from its mouth, consumes the waters of the ocean (I, <b>180</b>).— § 228: Hearing this the <i>viprarṣi</i> Parāśara controlled his wrath from destroying the worlds. But he performed a great <i>rākṣasa</i> sacrifice and began to burn the <i>rākṣasas</i> in it, and <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> did not restrain him. Desirous of ending that sacrifice the <i>ṛṣi Atri</i> came to that place, and also <i>Pulastya</i> and <i>Pulaha</i> and <i>Kratu</i>, desiring to save the <i>rākṣasas</i>. Seeing that many <i>rākṣasas</i> had already been slain, <i>Pulastya</i> said: “That which befell thy father was brought about by his own curse! No <i>rākṣasa</i> was capable of devouring <i>Śakti</i>; he himself provided for his own death! <i>Viśvāmitra</i> was only a blind instrument in that matter. Both <i>Śakti</i> and <i>Kalmāṣapāda</i> have ascended to heaven, and are enjoying great happiness, as also the other sons of <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>. Abandon this sacrifice of thine.” <i>Parāśara</i> then brought his sacrifice to an end, and threw the fire into the woods on the north of the <i>Himavat</i>, where it may be seen to this day consuming <i>rākṣasas</i> and trees and stones in all seasons (<i>parvaṇi parvaṇi</i>) (I, <b>181</b>)."
