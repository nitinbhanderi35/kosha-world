            "content": "tad. affix मत् changed in some cases to वत् (cf मादुपधायाश्च मतोर्वोऽयवादिभ्यः P. VIII. 2.9), applied to any noun or substantive in the sense of 'who possesses that,' or 'which contains it,' or in the sense of possession as popularly expressed. The affix is called possessive affix also, and is very commonly found in use; e. g. गोमान्, वृक्षवान्, यवमान्, etc. cf. तदस्यास्त्यस्मिन्निति मतुप् P. V. 2.94. The very general sense of 'possession' is limited to certain kinds of possession by the Vārttikakāra in the following stanza; भूमनिन्दाप्रशंसासु नित्ययोगेतिशायने | संसर्गेऽस्तिविवक्षायां भवन्ति मतुबादयः cf. Kāś. on P. V. 2.94. There are other tad. affixes prescribed in the same sense as मतुप्, such as the affixes लच् (V. 2.96-98), इलच् (99, 100, 105, 117), श and न (100), ण (101), विनि (102, 121, 122), इनि (102, 115, 116, 128, 129-137), अण् (103, 104), उरच् (106), र (107), म (108), व (109, 110), ईरन् and ईरच् (111), वलच् (112, 113), ठन् (115, 116), ठञ् (118, 119), यप् (120), युस् (123, 138, 140), ग्मिनि (124), आलच् and आटच् (125), अच् (127), and ब, भ, यु, ति, तु, त and यस् each one applied to spe cifically stated words. मतुप् is also specially prescribed after the words headed by रस (cf. रसादिभ्यश्च P. V. 2.95) in supersession of some of the other affixes mentioned above which would take place in such cases, if मतुप् were not prescribed by the rule रसादिभ्यश्च. The portion of the Aṣṭādhyāyī prescribing the possessive affixes is named मतुबधिकार (P. V. 2.92 to 140)."
