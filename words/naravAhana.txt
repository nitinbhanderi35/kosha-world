A Kṣatriya King who had obtained remission of the sin of Brahmahatyā (slaughter of Brahmin) by taking the fast of Vaiśākhavrata. <dvsn n='NI'/>This man who was a Kṣatriya of Pāñcāla once happened to kill a Brahmin with an arrow. To get remission of this sin, he discarded his Sacred thread, mark on the forehead and forelock and had been wandering here and there when he met a Brahmin named Muniśarmā. Naravāhana told him his story. This Brāhmaṇa who was a lover of God advised him regarding the importance of the Vaiśākha fast. By taking this fast the King obtained remission of sin.
