Ṛkṣa's</i> son, the king <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i>, duly worshipped <i>Sūrya</i>; to him <i>Sūrya-</i> resolved to bestow his daughter. Once, when <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i> went on a hunting expedition, his steed died from fatigue on the mountain, and he began to wander on foot and saw <i>Tapatī</i> alone, and declared her his love. She did not speak a word, but disappeared. He wandered through the whole forest in search of her, and failing to find her, indulged in lamentations (I, <b>171</b>). He fell down on the earth. Then she appeared again. He asked her to marry him according to the <i>Gāndharva</i> form of marriage. She said that she loved him, but told him to ask her father <i>Āditya</i> for her hand, with worship, ascetic penances, and vows (I, <b>172</b>). <i>Tapatī</i> then ascended to the skies, and <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i> again fell down on the earth. At last his followers found him, and his minister raised him up and sprinkled his head with water, etc. Regaining his consciousness, <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i> sent away all his attendants with the exception of his minister alone, and then began to worship <i>Sūrya</i>. He also thought of his <i>purohita</i>, the <i>ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha</i>. After the king had stayed thus on the same spot day and night, the <i>Viprarṣi Vasiṣṭha</i> came there on the 12th day. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> knew at once, by his ascetic power, what had happened and ascended to the sky in order to see <i>Sūrya</i>, and asked him to give <i>Tapatī</i> to <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i>. <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i>, with due rites, took <i>Tapatī's</i> hand on that mountain resorted to by the gods and the <i>Gandharvas</i>. And the king caused <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> to be proclaimed his regent in his capital and kingdom, etc., and sported with his wife in the woods on that mountain for twelve years. Now <i>Indra</i> for twelve years poured no rain in his capital and kingdom. Then <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> brought <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i> and his wife back into the city, and then <i>Indra</i> poured rain in abundance. <i>Saṃvaraṇa</i>, with <i>Tapatī</i>, performed sacrifices for twelve years. Their son was <i>Kuru</i>, the ancestor of <i>Arjuna</i> (I, <b>173</b>)."
