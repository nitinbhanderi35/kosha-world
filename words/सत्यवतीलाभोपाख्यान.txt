Āpavop.): Description of <i>Śāntanu</i>, the princes anointed him as “King of Kings” (<i>rājarājya</i>, v. 3974); he ruled the earth from <i>Hāsti-</i> <i>napura</i>, the town (<i>puṭabhedana</i>) of the <i>Kurus</i> (v. 3978); there was no killing of deer, boars, etc., under his reign (cf. § 162!) except for the sacrifices to the gods, <i>ṛṣis</i>, and <i>pitṛs</i>. For thirty-six years he, without enjoying the love of women, roamed about in the woods, and his son, <i>Gāṅgeya Devarata</i>, the <i>Vasu</i>, was equal to him. One day, when pursuing a deer he had wounded along the banks of the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, he saw a youth who, with a heavenly weapon, checked the flow of the <i>Gaṅgā</i>. It was his son who, knowing him, but not known by him, and clouding his perception by illusion (<i>māyā</i>), suddenly disappeared. On <i>Śāntanu's</i> prayer, <i>Gangā</i> appeared holding the boy, and having told him that he was his son, and that he had studied all the <i>Vedas</i> and their <i>Aṅgas</i> with <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> and knew all <i>śāstras</i> that were known by <i>Uśanas</i> and <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (adored by the gods and <i>Asuras</i>), and by the <i>ṛṣi Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>, and also the <i>rājadharmas</i>, she let him take him to his capital, where he was installed as heir-apparent. After four years <i>Śāntanu</i> met with <i>Satyavatī</i> in the wood on the banks of <i>Yamunā</i>, and demanded her hand from her father, the king of the fishermen (<i>dāśarāja</i>), who would not consent unless <i>Śāntanu</i> would promise that his son by <i>Satyavatī</i> should become his successor on the throne. <i>Śāntanu</i> would not grant the boon, but returned to <i>Hāsti-</i> <i>napura</i> and passed his time in sorrow until <i>Devavrata</i>, having learned from the old minister the cause of his grief, by declaring that he would adopt the vow of <i>brahmacarya</i> (including celibacy), prevailed upon the fisherman (who had formerly rejected the <i>Devarṣi Asita</i>, because <i>Parāśara</i> had pointed out to him <i>Śāntanu</i> as a suitable husband for her), that he gave <i>Satyavatī</i> to <i>Śāntanu</i>, while the gods and <i>ṛṣis</i> showered flowers upon <i>Devavrata</i>, calling him <i>Bhīṣma</i>. <i>Bhīṣma</i> then took the maiden to <i>Hāstinapura</i> on his chariot, and <i>Śāntanu</i> bestowed upon him the boon of death at choice (I, <b>100</b>).
