(†vv. 4549—4561). <i>Bhīṣma</i> said: Once B.-ṛ. and Ṛ.-ṛ. proceeded to the western <i>Prabhāsa</i>, and resolved to visit all the sacred waters on earth; there were <i>Śukra</i>, etc. (α), and <i>Indra</i>; they reached <i>Kauśikī</i> on the day of full-moon in the month of <i>Māgha</i>, and then <i>Brahmasaras</i>, where they gathered and ate the stalks of the lotus; <i>Agastya's</i> stalks had been taken away; he complained of the increasing unrighteousness, and thought of going to heaven in order not to live to see <is>yet worse things</is>; the Ṛ. took, each of them, the most frightful oaths to their own innocence (β); but <i>Indra</i> uttered “a benediction instead of a curse,” and confessed that he had stolen the stalks, not from cupidity, but from desire of hearing what Ṛ. would say. <i>Agastya</i> forgave him. Then they proceeded to other <i>tīrthas</i> *(XIII, <b>94</b>)."
