The only daughter of Dhṛtarāṣṭra by Gāndhārī. <dvsn n='NI'/>(1) She was married to Jayadratha the Rājā of Sindhu. <dvsn n='NI'/>(2) <i>Her birth.</i> See under Kauravas. <dvsn n='NI'/>(3) Yudhiṣṭhira did not permit Jayadratha to be killed when he abducted Pāñcālī as he was the husband of Duśśalā. (Vana Parva, Chapter 271, Verse 43). <dvsn n='NI'/>(4) When Arjuna reached Vidarbha attending the Aśvamedha yajña the archers obstructed his progress, and he killed them all. Suratha, son of Duśśalā, was also among those killed, and she came to the battlefield with her infant child crying, whereupon Arjuna stopped the fighting and in remorse crowned the son of Suratha as the King of Sindhu. (Aśvamedha Parva, Chapters 78 and 89)."
