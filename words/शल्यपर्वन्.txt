The troops were filled with enthusiasm; they took up their quarters about two yojanas distant, and bathed in the <i>Sarasvatī</i> of red waters on the sacred and beautiful tableland at the foot of <i>Himavat</i> (IX, <b>5</b>); there they passed the night: <i>Śalya</i>, etc. (ξ), and urged <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to continue the battle. <i>Duryodhana</i> addressed <i>Aśvatthāman</i> (description) (ο), according to whose proposal <i>Śalya</i> was made generalissimo (π) (IX, <b>6</b>); <i>Śalya</i> promised to slay the foes (ρ). <i>Śalya</i> was anointed; the troops became cheerful (σ). <i>Śalya</i> resolved to slay or be slain (τ). No one any longer felt any grief on account of <i>Karṇa</i>; they slept that night happily and became very cheerful. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> his advice (υ); <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> praised <i>Śalya (Ārtāyani</i>), saying that he was equal to <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ϕ), and superior to <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, etc. (χ); he thought only <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was a match for <i>Śalya</i>, and urged him to slay him. After <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had gone, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> dismissed all his brothers and the <i>Somakas</i> and slept happily that night, and so did the <i>Pāñcālas</i> and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, delighted with <i>Karṇa's</i> fall (IX, <b>7</b>).—§ 611: THE BATTLE OF THE FORENOON OF THE EIGHTEENTH DAY. After that night had passed away, the <i>Kuru</i> army, urged by <i>Duryodhana</i>, prepared for battle; the leaders, <i>Kṛpa</i>, etc. (α), resolved to fight unitedly (“or be stained with the five great sins and all the minor sins”). Then, with <i>Śalya</i> at their head, they quickly proceeded against the foes. Similarly, the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>. Asked by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> about <i>Śalya's</i> slaughter by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Duryodhana's</i> by <i>Bhīmasena</i>, <i>Sañjaya</i> related: <i>Śalya</i> proceeded with horses of the <i>Sindhu</i> breed yoked unto his chariot, at the head of the array, accompanied by the <i>Madrakas</i> and the sons of <i>Karṇa</i>; enumeration of warriors on the left (β), on the right (γ), in the rear (δ), in the centre (ε); <i>Śakuni</i> and <i>Ulūka</i> surrounded by a large force of cavalry, etc. The mighty bowmen amongst the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> divided themselves into three bodies, and rushed against the <i>Kurus; Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ζ), against the army of <i>Śalya</i>; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> with his troops against <i>Śalya</i> alone; <i>Arjuna</i> against <i>Kṛtavarman</i> and the <i>Saṃśaptakas; Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (η), against <i>Kṛpa; Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i> against <i>Śakuni</i> and <i>Ulūka</i>. Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> enumerated the relative strength of the two armies (θ) (IX, <b>8</b>). The commencement of the battle (description); a terrible slaughter on both sides. <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Bhīmasena</i> stupefied their foes; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ι), & <i>Śalya; Nakula</i> and <i>Sahadeva</i> proceeded with speed; the <i>Kurus</i> fled away (IX, <b>9</b>). <i>Śalya</i> <i>& Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (+ the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> host); <i>Nakula & Karṇa's</i> son <i>Citrasena</i>, whom he slew; <i>Nakula & Citrasena's</i> brothers <i>Satyasena</i> and <i>Suṣeṇa; Nakula</i> slew <i>Satyasena</i>, mounted the chariot of <i>Sutasoma</i>, and slew <i>Suṣeṇa</i>. The <i>Kurus</i> were rallied by <i>Śalya</i>; a great slaughter took place on both sides. <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (κ), roared like lions, etc. The <i>Kurus</i> surrounded <i>Śalya</i>; thither came <i>Arjuna</i>, having slaughtered the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i>, and the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> headed by <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> (IX, <b>10</b>). <i>Śalya</i> fought with great heroism against the troops of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; portents appeared on earth and in the skies. <i>Śalya & Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (λ); many were slain; the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army repaired to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, etc. (μ), & <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc.; <i>Kṛtavarman &</i> <i>Bhīmasena; Kṛpa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Śakuni &</i> the <i>Draupa-</i> <i>deyas; Aśvatthāman &</i> the twins; <i>Duryodhana & Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>; the <i>Bhoja</i> chief slew the brown steeds of <i>Bhīmasena</i>; <i>Śalya</i> slew the steeds of <i>Sahadeva</i>, who then slew <i>Śalya's</i> son; <i>Kṛpa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Aśvatthāman &</i> the <i>Draupadeyas</i>; once more the steeds of <i>Bhīmasena</i> were slain; he crushed the steeds and chariot of <i>Kṛtavarman</i>, who fled away; <i>Śalya &</i> <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ν); <i>Bhīma</i> (with his mace, with which he had challenged <i>Kubera</i> and slain Gh. on Gandhamādana) & <i>Śalya</i> (IX, <b>11</b>); “save <i>Śalya</i> or <i>Rāma</i> (the delighter of the <i>Yadus</i>), none else can venture to encounter <i>Bhīma</i>; save <i>Bhīma</i>, none can venture to encounter <i>Śalya”; Kṛpa</i> taking up <i>Śalya</i> on his own chariot, bore him away; <i>Bhīma</i> had also been made senseless. The <i>Kurus</i> (headed by <i>Duryodhana</i>) & the <i>Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana & Cekitāna; Kṛpa</i>, etc. (ξ), & <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Aśvatthāman</i> (with 3,000 chariots, despatched by <i>Duryodhana</i>) & <i>Arjuna</i>; <i>Śalya + Candrasena + Drumasena & Yudhiṣṭhira</i> + 25 <i>Cedis</i>, etc. (ο); <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was worsted (IX, <b>12</b>). <i>Sātyaki</i> and <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (ο) (<i>+ Yudhiṣṭhira) & Śalya</i>; Si., etc., were delighted; <i>Duryodhana</i> regarded the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas</i>, and <i>Sṛñjayas</i> as already slain; the <i>Pāṇḍavas & Śalya</i>, who agitated the whole <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army; D. and G. wondered; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with <i>Bhīmasena</i> at their head and led by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> did not fly (IX, <b>13</b>). <i>Arjuna & Aśvatthāman</i> and the <i>Trigartas; Arjuna</i> destroyed 2,000 chariots; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> & the <i>Pāñcāla Suratha</i>, whom he slew; <i>Aśvatthāman</i> and the <i>Saṃśaptakas & Arjuna</i> (IX, <b>14</b>). <i>Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Śikhaṇḍin</i> + the <i>Prabhadrakas & Kṛtavarman</i> and <i>Kṛpa; Śalya &</i> the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (with <i>Bhīma</i>, etc. (π), and <i>Sātyaki</i>); <i>Nakula + Yudhiṣṭhira</i> <i>& Śalya; Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ρ), <i>& Śalya; Śalya & Bhīmasena</i> <i>+ Sātyaki</i> (whom he deprived of his chariot); <i>Sātyaki</i> (on another chariot) & <i>Śalya</i> (IX, <b>15</b>). The <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (in the very sight of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>, and though checked by <i>Bhīmasena</i>) were afflicted by the <i>Kurus</i> (headed by <i>Śalya</i>). <i>Arjuna & Kṛpa</i> and <i>Kṛtavarman; Sahadeva & Śakuni; Nakula</i> cast glances on <i>Śalya</i> from the side; the <i>Draupadeyas</i> checked numerous kings; <i>Śikhaṇḍin & Aśvatthāman; Bhīmasena &</i> <i>Duryodhana; Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Śalya</i> alone fought with the whole <i>Pāṇḍava</i> army; <i>Śalya & Bhīma</i>; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> fled, disregarding the cries of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who, summoning all his brothers and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, declared that after <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (σ), had been slain, <i>Śalya</i> only remained as his share; the sons of <i>Mādrī</i> should be the protectors of his wheels; <i>Sātyaki</i> would protect his right wheel and <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> his left, <i>Arjuna</i> his rear, <i>Bhīma</i> fight in his front. The <i>Pāṇḍava</i> troops rejoiced, especially the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (τ); <i>Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Bhīma &</i> <i>Duryodhana; Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (υ), & <i>Śakuni</i>, etc.; <i>Duryodhana</i> was borne away by his steeds; <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, etc. (ϕ), followed him in order to rescue him; the <i>Kaurava</i> troops became terrified; <i>Arjuna</i> began to slay them; <i>Śalya</i> was worsted by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; the army of <i>Duryodhana</i> broke; <i>Aśvatthāman</i>, taking <i>Śalya</i> up on his own chariot, fled away; <i>Śalya</i> (on another chariot) & <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (IX, <b>16</b>) + <i>Sātyaki</i>, etc. (χ); the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ψ), & <i>Śalya</i>; the <i>Kurus</i> surrounded <i>Śalya</i> at the command of <i>Duryodhana</i>; <i>Kṛpa</i> slew <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> charioteer, and <i>Śalya</i> his steeds; <i>Bhīmasena</i> slew <i>Śalya's</i> charioteer and steeds and cut off his armour; <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i>, etc. (ω), & <i>Śalya; Yudhiṣṭhira</i> slew <i>Śalya</i> with a celestial dart (created by <i>Tvaṣṭṛ</i> for the use of <i>Īśāna</i>, and always worshipped by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> with perfumes and garlands and excellent seats and the best kinds of viands and drinks). <i>Śalya's</i> younger brother & <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, who slew him; the <i>Kurus</i> broke; <i>Sātyaki</i> <i>& Kṛtavarman</i>, whom <i>Kṛpa</i> carried away on his chariot; <i>Duryodhana</i> alone withstood the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> leaders (αα); <i>Kṛtavarman</i> (on another chariot) + <i>Kṛpa & Yudhiṣṭhira</i>; <i>Kṛtavarman</i> was carried away by <i>Aśvatthāman</i> upon the latter's chariot; <i>Kṛpa & Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. The <i>Pārthas</i> blew their conchs and applauded <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (IX, <b>17</b>). The followers of <i>Śalya</i> (1,700 <i>Madrakas</i>) resolved to avenge him; <i>Duryodhana</i> commanded them not to proceed to battle; they, however, attacked <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna</i>, etc. (ββ), & the <i>Madrakas</i>, whom they began to slaughter; <i>Duryodhana</i> in vain tried to prevent them from fighting; then, urged by <i>Śakuni</i>, he proceeded to the rescue of the <i>Madrakas</i>.

The <i>Sṛñjayas</i> pursued the <i>Kurus; Arjuna</i> & the chariot-division; <i>Nakula</i>, etc. (εε), & <i>Śakuni.
