A very brief summary of it is given below: <dvsn n='NI'/>The King should organise six kinds of army formations, worship the Devas duly and then set out for war. Mūlabala, Bhūtabala, Śreṇībala, Suhṛdbala, Śatrubala and Āṭavikabala are the six kinds of army formations. The list is given in order of the comparative importance of the bala. The army has six parts i.e. Mantra (advisers), Koṣa (treasury), Padāti (infantry), Turaga (Cavalry), Gaja (elephant) and Ratha (chariot). <dvsn n='NI'/>If an attack is feared either against the forts or across rivers or trenches, the army should be marched for their protection. The Army Chieftains surrounded by mighty warriors should lead the divisions. The King and his wife should be at the centre of the army-division along with the treasury and first class soldiers. On both sides of the King should march the cavalry and the chariots should form the farther wings. Elephants should proceed on the two sides of the chariot and soldiers recruited from forests must march on the sides of the elephants. The supreme commander will march behind all the others guiding the army. <dvsn n='NI'/>If there is cause for fear in front of the army during the march, three Vyūhas (Phalanxes) Makara, Śyena or Sūcī should be put in the Vanguard. The Śakaṭa Vyūha is more suited to meet an attack from behind. If attack is feared from the flanks then also the Śakaṭavyūha is advisable. When attack from all the sides is feared sarvatobhadravyūha is indicated. It is the duty of the Supreme Commander to safe-guard his army and suppress reactionary forces whenever the army gets weakened, when it marches through caves, mountains or rocks or other difficult terrain or weakened by the persistent attacks of the enemy. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the time, place and the people's attitude are favourable, the King should engage himself in open war with the enemy, and if they are unfavourable he shall not go in for war. If confrontation with the enemy occurs under circumstances in which the King is visible to the enemy, powerful divisions of the army consisting of warriors of great calibre should be stationed either at the front or in the rear. <dvsn n='NI'/>In the formation of vyūhas (phalanx) there are seven factors called Uras (breast), Kakṣas (arm-pits), two Pakṣas (sides), two Madhyas (centre) and Pṛṣṭha (rear). The commanders should be surrounded by bold soldiers. The leader is the very life of the war. At the Uras of the vyūha powerful elephants, at the Kakṣas chariots and at the Pakṣas cavalry should be stationed. This is called pakṣabhedivyūha. If at the centre cavalry and at Kakṣas and Pakṣas elephants are stationed, it is called antarbhedivyūha. If there are no chariots, cavalry or infantry may be put in their place. Certain authorities maintain that in every vyūha elephants may be stationed in the place of chariots, if chariots are not available. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 242)."
