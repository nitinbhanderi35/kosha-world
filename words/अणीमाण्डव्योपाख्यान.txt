Suspicion had fallen upon him, because thieves had hid their plunder in his hermitage, while he was sitting for years with his arms upraised observing the vow of silence. When impaled, he by his ascetic power not only preserved his life, but summoned other <i>ṛṣis</i> to the scene, who came in the night in the shape of birds (I, <b>107</b>). Hearing that he was alive, the king asked his pardon and endeavoured to extract the stake from his body, but was obliged to cut it off outside the body. <i>Māṇḍavya</i> henceforth walked about with the stake in his life, and thereby conquered <i>lokas</i> unattainable by others and was called <i>Aṇīmāṇḍavya</i> (v. 4329). He ruled that an act should not be sinful when committed by one below the age of 14 years (I, <b>108</b>)."
