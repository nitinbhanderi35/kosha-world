The Gītā covers chapters 25-45 in the Bhīṣma Parva of the Mahābhārata, and it is in the form of a talk or discussion between Arjuna and Lord Kṛṣṇa. The mighty armies of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas were arrayed on opposite sides for mortal combat on the field of Kurukṣetra when Arjuna, overcome by grief at the prospect of fathers, brothers, preceptors and other Kinsmen fighting and killing one another expressed to his charioteer, Śrī Kṛṣṇa his aversion to fighting. But, the Lord pointed out to the unwilling Arjuna, by unique and various arguments, his imperative duty, under the circumstance, to fight and fight in heroic earnestness with the result that Arjuna shed his disinclination to fight and entered the fray, which ended in the ultimate victory of the Pāṇḍavas. And the dialogue between Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa, and especially the great teaching of Kṛṣṇa on the field form the theme of the Gītā. The Gītā contains three spheres or fields of teaching; the karma yoga (philosophy of action), jñāna yoga (philosophy of knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (philosophy of devotion). The three yogas are treated each in six chapters. <dvsn n='NI'/>The theme of the Gītā is philosophy, and it is revered as one of the most sublime philosophical texts of the Hindu religion. Many a great thinker and philosopher like Ācārya Śaṅkara, Rāmānujācārya and Madhvācārya have annotated, and written commentaries on the Gītā. There is a school of thought which believes that the Gītā was taught to Arjuna by Kṛṣṇa himself on the battle-field in something like tabloid form and that Vyāsa elaborated the mighty teaching in its present form. The poet, Bāṇa, who flourished in the 7th century A.D., and the great Śaṅkara, who lived in the 8th century believed that the Gītā was sung by Kṛṣṇa himself. But there are some modern thinkers, who argue that the Gītā was composed some time between the third and fourth centuries B.C. and it was interpolated into the Mahābhārata in the second century A.D. <dvsn n='NI'/>The Gītā has translations in all the languages of the world. The whole world has acclaimed it as a very weighty and valuable contribution in the sphere of philosophy. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Theme of the Gītā.</i> It has been mentioned above that the Gītā forms chapters 25-45 in the Bhīṣma Parva of the Mahābhārata.
