A King born of the Yadu dynasty. <dvsn n='NI'/>1) <i>Genealogy.</i> Descending in order from Viṣṇu— Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-NahuṣaYayāti-Yadu-Kroṣṭā-Vṛjivān-Śvāhi-Ruśeku-CitrarathaŚaśabindu-Pṛthuśravas-Gharma-Rucaka (Rukmakavaca)-Jyāmagha-Lomapāda. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Birth.</i> Rukmakavaca, grandfather of Lomapāda conquered many countries and gave them all as gifts to those brahmins who participated in his Aśvamedhayajña. He got five brave sons, Rukmeṣu, Pṛthurukma, Jyāmagha, Parigha and Hari. Of them he made Parigha and Hari live and rule in Videha. Rukmeṣu ruled his father's country and Pṛthurukma helped his brother. Jyāmagha was sent out from his country and he lived quietly in a hermitage. One day as per the advice of a sage he left the place in a chariot with a flag flying to the shores of the river Narmadā. He had neither servants nor the means for his daily food. He lived on the mountain Ṛkṣavān eating only roots and fruits. He was very old and his wife Śaibyā also was getting old. They had no sons and still Jyāmagha did not marry again. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once when Jyāmagha gained a victory in a fight, he brought a girl and entrusted the child to his wife saying “This child is your daughter-in-law.” Śaibyā was surprised and enquired “How can that be when I have no son?” Jyāmagha replied, “She is to be the wife of a son who will be born to you soon.” By means of the hard penance of that girl, Śaibyā got a handsome son named Vidarbha. Vidarbha married her and got two wise sons, Kratha and Kaiśika and a third son Lomapāda, who was righteous, virtuous and wise. All the three were great warriors also. Descending in order from Lomapāda came Babhru-Heti-Kaiśika-Cidi. From this Cidi came the Cedi dynasty of Kings. (Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa, Bhīṣmapulastya Saṃvāda)."
