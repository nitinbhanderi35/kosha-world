But a careful scrutiny will support the reading Puṣyamitra as more likely. In the passages quoted by Bühler from the Prakrit Gāthās, ascribed to Merutuṅga, Dharmasāgara and Jayavijayāgni<sup>29</sup>, the name of the early king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Puṣyamitra. <dvsn n='P'/>Puṣyamitra in plural may denote the followers of king Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India, is also mentioned in the Purāṇas."
