            "content": "<b>Rāmopākhyāna</b><sup>2</sup>¦ (“the episode relating to Rāma Jāmadagnya”). § 638<i>b</i> (Rājadh.): <i>Jahnu > Aja > Balākāśva</i> <i>> Kuśika</i>, who performed penances in order to get a son; <i>Indra</i> became his son: <C n='1'/><i>Gādhi</i>. <C n='2'/><i>Bhṛgu</i>. <C n='1'/>(2) <i>Viśvāmitra</i>. <C n='2'/>(1) <i>Satyavatī~Ṛcīka</i>. <C n='1'/><i>Jamadagni</i>. <C n='1'/><i>Paraśu-Rāma</i>. <i>Ṛcīka</i> destined a certain portion of the sacrificial food (wherein had been placed the <i>brahman</i> energy) for <i>Satyavatī</i>, which would give her a son of great wisdom, the foremost of <i>brahmans</i>; and another (wherein had been placed the sum total of <i>kṣatriya</i> energy) for her mother, which would give her for a son an invincible <i>kṣatriya</i>. Then <i>Ṛcīka</i> proceeded to the woods to practise penances. King <i>Gādhi</i>, on a <i>tīrtha-</i> <i>yātrā</i>, arrived at <i>Ṛcīka's</i> retreat with his queen. There the mother of <i>Satyavatī</i>, from ignorance, exchanged the two portions of the food. <i>Ṛcīka</i> predicted that the son of <i>Satyavatī</i> would become a terrible <i>kṣatriya</i>, but asked by <i>Satyavatī</i>, he granted that not her son (<i>Jamadagni</i>) but her grandson (<i>Paraśu-Rāma</i>) would become such; her mother would give birth to a brahman (<i>Viśvāmitra</i>). Besides the other sciences, <i>Rāma</i> mastered the <i>Dhanurveda</i>; gratifying <i>Mahādeva</i> on <i>Gandhamādana</i>, he asked him for weapons, especially the axe, which made him unrivalled on earth. Meanwhile the virtuous <i>kṣatriya</i>, the <i>Haihaya</i> king <i>Arjuna</i> <i>Kārtavīrya</i>, who had got 1,000 arms through the grace of <i>Dattātreya</i>, having subjugated the whole earth with its mountains and seven islands, became a powerful emperor, and gave away the earth to the <i>brahmans</i> at a horsesacrifice. Once, solicited by <i>Agni</i>, he gave alms to that deity: springing from the points of his shafts, <i>Agni</i> burnt villages, etc., and also the retreat of <i>Āpava</i> (i.e. <i>Vasiṣṭha</i>, Nīl.), who cursed <i>Arjuna</i>, saying that <i>Rāma</i> should lop off his arms. <i>Arjuna</i>, always devoted to peace, always regardful of <i>brahmans</i>, etc., did not think of that curse. His sons, always haughty and cruel, seized and brought away the calf of <i>Jamadagni's homa-</i>cow, without the knowledge of <i>Arjuna; Rāma</i> lopped off the arms of <i>Arjuna</i> and brought back the calf; the sons of <i>Arjuna</i> came and slew <i>Jamadagni</i>, in the absence of <i>Rāma</i>, who vowed to free the earth of <i>kṣatriyas</i>, and slaughtered all the sons and grandsons of <i>Arjuna</i>, and thousands of <i>Haihayas</i>, and annihilated all <i>kṣatriyas</i>, and then, filled with compassion, retired into the woods. After some thousands of years, the grandson of <i>Viśvāmitra</i> and son of <i>Raibhya, Parāvasu</i> said to <i>Rāma</i> in public: “were not <i>Pratardana</i>, etc., who were assembled at a sacrifice at the time of <i>Yayāti's</i> fall, <i>kṣatriyas</i> by birth; thou art not true of thy vow; through fear of <i>kṣatriya</i> heroes thou hast betaken thyself to the mountains.” <i>Rāma</i> once more slew <i>kṣatriyas</i> by hundreds. Those <i>kṣatriyas</i>, however, that he spared, counted by hundreds, multiplied and became mighty monarchs on earth. <i>Rāma</i> once more slaughtered them, not sparing the very children. Some <i>kṣatriya</i> ladies, however, succeeded in protecting their children. Having made the earth destitute of <i>kṣatriyas</i> twenty-one times, <i>Rāma</i>, at the completion of a horsesacrifice, gave away the earth as a sacrificial present to <i>Kaśyapa</i>. In order to preserve the remnant of the <i>kṣatriyas</i>, <i>Kaśyapa</i> told <i>Rāma</i> to repair to the shores of the southern ocean and not to reside within his dominion. The ocean suddenly created <i>Śūrpāraka</i> for <i>Rāma. Kaśyapa</i> gave the earth to the <i>brahmans</i> and then entered the great forest. Then <i>śūdras</i> and <i>vaiśyas</i> began to cohabit with the wives of <i>brahmans</i>; unprotected duly by <i>kṣatriyas</i>, the earth quickly sank, and was held by <i>Kaśyapa</i> on his lap (<i>ūru</i>), whence she was called <i>Urvī</i>. For protection's sake she asked <i>Kaśyapa</i> for a king, saying that she had concealed some <i>Haihaya kṣatriyas</i> among women; [further] <i>Paurava</i> (son of <i>Vidūratha</i>), brought up among bears in the <i>Ṛkṣavat</i> mountain; [further] a son of <i>Saudāsa</i>, protected through compassion by <i>Parāśara</i>, and named <i>Sarvakarman</i> (etymology); <i>Śibi's</i> son <i>Gopati</i>, brought up in the forest among kine; <i>Pratardana's</i> son <i>Vatsa</i>, brought up among calves in a cowpen; <i>Dadhivāhana's</i> grandson and <i>Diviratha's</i> son, concealed on the banks of <i>Gaṅgā</i> by <i>Gautama; Bṛhadratha</i>, protected by apes (<i>? golāṅgūlaiḥ</i>, cf. BR.; PCR.: wolves) on <i>Gṛdhrakūṭa</i>; many <i>kṣatriyas</i> belonging to the race of <i>Marutta</i> have been brought up by the ocean; they are living among artisans and goldsmiths; “their fathers and grandfathers have been slain for my sake by <i>Rāma</i>; it is my duty to see that their funeral rites are duly performed.” <i>Kaśyapa</i>, seeking out those <i>kṣatriyas</i>, installed them duly as kings in days of yore. Those <i>kṣatriya</i> races that are now extant are the progeny of those princes."
