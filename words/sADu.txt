The Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa contains the following story about it. <dvsn n='NI'/>When the Himālaya and Maināka mountains once began a very intense tapas, the Devas and Ṛṣis fearing great ruin to the world in case the mountains got salvation, sought Śiva's protection and prayed for a solution for the problem. So Śiva, in the guise of a brahmin named Sādhu, went to the mountains, spoke to them condemning Śiva and thus made them retract from their devotion to Śiva."
