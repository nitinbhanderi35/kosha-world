This fort is seven yojanas high. All things inside it, the ground, the trees, the birds, the animals, plants, creepers and gardens are puṣparāga-studded and look red like saffron. Therefore the fort is called Ratnaśālā also. All the dikpālakas of the universe live with their family and attendants in this fort. (12th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata)."
