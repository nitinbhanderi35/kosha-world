The six divorced wives of the <i>ṛṣis</i>, together with <i>Vinatā</i>, obtained permission from <i>Skanda</i> to become his mothers. At the request of <i>Indra</i> the <i>Kṛttikās</i> (i.e. the six wives of the <i>ṛṣis</i>) (together with <i>Vinatā</i>, see v. 14464 and Nīl.) are placed among the <i>nakṣatras</i> (and presided over by <i>Agni</i>) instead of <i>Abhijit</i>, the younger sister of <i>Rohiṇī</i>, who from jealousy had repaired to the woods. <i>Brahmán</i> ordered that time should be reckoned from <i>Dhaniṣṭhā</i>, while it had formerly been reckoned from <i>Rohiṇī</i> (so Nīl.). Then (these seven) mothers asked <i>Skanda</i> that they might become the mothers of the worlds instead of the old mothers (<i>Brāhmī, Māheśvarī</i>, etc.; Nīl.) and devour the progeny of those old mothers, because they had slandered them before their husbands, and always dwell with <i>Skanda</i>. <i>Skanda</i> granted that until the age of 16 years they should have the power of afflicting the human kind, and he loosed from his body his <i>Raudra</i> nature, under the name of <i>Skandāpasmāra</i>, that they might dwell with him. Enumeration of several grahas (the number 18 in v. 14490 is difficult to explain), among others (α) the male and female children of <i>Skanda</i> (the males are the husbands of the females); they are all named <i>Skandagrahas</i>; they are propitiated with offerings, ablutions, unguents, etc., and particularly by the worship of <i>Skanda</i>; and when they are propitiated they bestow good on men. Then are mentioned the <i>grahas</i>, that afflict men from the 16th to the 70th year; after the 70th year fever takes the place of the <i>grahas</i>. These evil spirits always avoid those who have subdued their senses, etc., and those who are devoted to <i>Maheśvara</i> (III, <b>230</b>)."
