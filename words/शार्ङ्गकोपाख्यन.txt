He then reflected how he could obtain numerous offspring in the shortest time possible; he learnt that the birds were peculiarly prolific, and, becoming a <i>śārṅgika</i>, he married the <i>śārṅgikā Jaritā</i>, and begat upon her four sons, who were all reciters of the <i>Vedas</i>. Then he left her and married <i>Lapitā</i>. When <i>Agni</i> came to the forest of <i>Khāṇḍava</i> to burn it down, <i>Mandapāla</i> praised <i>Agni</i> (vv. 8353—8360) and prevailed upon him to spare his children (I, <b>229</b>). <i>Jaritā</i> told her sons (<i>Jaritāri, Sārisṛkva, Stamba-</i> <i>mitra</i>, and <i>Droṇa</i>), who would have her to rescue herself by abandoning them, to conceal themselves in the hole of a mouse; but they were afraid of the mouse (I, <b>230</b>). Finally <i>Jaritā</i> was prevailed upon by her sons to abandon them, and <i>Agni</i> approached the spot where the sons were (I, <b>231</b>). The four young <i>ṛṣis</i> praised <i>Agni</i>, who promised them safety and granted them a boon. <i>Droṇa</i> asked him to consume the cats that troubled them every day (I, <b>232</b>). Mean while <i>Manda-</i> <i>pāla</i> addressed <i>Lapitā</i>, being anxious about his children. <i>Lapitā</i>, from jealousy, told him to go to <i>Jaritā</i>, who, she said, was the real cause of his anxiety. When <i>Agni</i> had spared the children, <i>Jaritā</i> came and embraced them. When <i>Mandapāla</i> came they did not speak to him, and <i>Jaritā</i>, from jealousy, told him to go to <i>Lapitā. Mandapāla</i> declared that nothing was so destructive to the happiness of women as a concubine, except a lover; witness <i>Arundhatī (b</i>). Then all his children came forward to worship him, and he also spoke kindly to them all (I, <b>233</b>). <i>Mandapāla</i> told that he had asked <i>Agni</i> to protect them, and therefore he had not come earlier. Then he took his wives and sons with him and went away to some other country (I, <b>234</b>)."
