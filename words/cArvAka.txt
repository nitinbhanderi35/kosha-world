The following story is told about how he happened to become Duryodhana's friend. <dvsn n='NI'/>In the Kṛtayuga this Rākṣasa did tapas to please Brahmā at Badaryāśrama, and Brahmā gave him the boon that he would be safe from all beings. Then he went round the world troubling brahmins, who, at last sought refuge in Brahmā, and he pacified them with the assurance that Cārvāka would become a friend of Duryodhana when he would insult Brahmins and be reduced to ashes in the fire of their anger. <dvsn n='NI'/>Accordingly Cārvāka became a friend of Duryodhana. When, after the great war, Dharmaputra entered Hastināpura with his followers thousands of brahmins gathered around and blessed him. Cārvāka also disguised as a brahmin came there and condemning Dharmaputra as an enemy of his own people cursed him. The brahmins recognised him and cursed him to ashes. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapters 38, 39)."
