Droṇa, after practising severe austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught by Droṇa to Arjuna when he was satisfied (<i>pritimān, prīyamāṇaḥ</i>) with him (Arjuna) 1. 123. 72; 10. 12. 5 and, not with great delight (<i>nātihṛṣṭamanāḥ</i>), to Aśvatthāman whom he had apparently first refused to teach 10. 12. 6. <b>B.</b> Description: powerful missile (<i>para-</i> <i>māstra</i>) 1. 123. 78; 10. 15. 3, 6; famous as ‘uncomparable’ in the worlds (<i>asāmānyam</i> <i>idaṃ tāta lokeṣv astraṃ nigadyate</i>) 1. 123. 76; divine (<i>divya</i>) 10. 15. 16; outstanding (<i>viśiṣṭa</i>) 1. 123. 74; highly irresistible (<i>ati-</i> <i>durdhara</i>) 1. 123. 74; fiery (<i>mahārciṣmat</i>) 10. 14. 7; difficult to obtain (<i>duravāpa</i>) 10. 15. 9; worshipped by gods and Gandharvas (<i>devagandharvapūjita</i>) 10. 12. 14; capable of burning the whole earth (<i>dahed yad pṛthivīm</i> <i>api</i>) 10. 12. 4. <b>C.</b> Restrictions on its use: (1) while giving the <i>astra</i> to Arjuna, Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but to use it only if he was attacked in a battle by a superhuman enemy (<i>amānuṣaḥ śatruḥ</i>); if released against an enemy of lesser mettle (<i>alpatejas</i>), the missile would burn the world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it even under dire circumstances in battle, especially not against men (<i>paramāpadgatenāpi</i> <i>na sma tāta tvayā raṇe / idam astraṃ</i> <i>prayoktavyaṃ mānuṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ</i>) 10. 12. 7-8. <b>D.</b> Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be distinguished among his pupils (<i>viśiṣṭaṃ sarva-</i> <i>śiṣyebhyaḥ</i>) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled archer (<i>bhavitā tvatsamo nānyaḥ pumāl̃ loke</i> <i>dhanurdharaḥ</i>) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal (<i>saprayoganivartanam</i>) 1. 123. 74; its withdrawal very difficult; once released, no one except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be withdrawn by one who had not observed celibacy; if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw it, it would cut his head and destroy his belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could withdraw it as he was truthful, brave, had practised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher 10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the epic war nor outside it, even under stress (<i>brahmacārī vratī cāpi duravāpam avāpya</i> <i>tat / paramavyasanārto 'pi nārjuno 'straṃ</i> <i>vyamuñcata</i>) 10. 15. 9, (<i>brahmāstram apy</i> <i>avāpyaitad … kṣatradharmān mahābāhur</i> <i>nākampata dhanaṃjayaḥ</i>) 10. 15. 21; (2) Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave it to him but not with a pleased mind (<i>nāti-</i> <i>hṛṣṭamanā iva</i>) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthāman could not make use of it) he wanted to exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana) Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invincible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman without receiving from him in return his Brahmaśiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose the Cakra but failed even so much as to move it from its place 10. 12. 20-23. <b>E.</b> Use: As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12. 40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an <i>iṣīkā,</i> Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down from the chariot with bow and arrow in hand, wished ‘well’ (<i>svasti</i> 10. 14. 5; 1. 1. 155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then bowing down to deities and teachers, he released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthāman's) missile’ (<i>utsasarja śivaṃ dhyāyann</i> <i>astram astreṇa śāmyatām</i>) 10. 14. 4-6; 10. 15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvatthāman's missile; as a result terror struck the creatures, skies were filled with great sound and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11; just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, desiring welfare for all the people, appeared and stood between the two missiles; they pointed out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response to their appeal, Arjuna immediately withdrew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras was pacified by the other powerful missile (<i>paramāstra</i>) there would be no rain in the land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthāman then directed his missile towards the foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10. 16. 9.
