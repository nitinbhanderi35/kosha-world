By slaying <i>Vṛtra, Indra</i> became <i>Mahendra</i> (“the great Indra”), and obtained the <i>soṃa</i>-cup of Mahendra (v. 4562, B.: <i>Māhendraṃ ca grahaṃ lebhe</i>), and the lordship of all the worlds…Sovereignty is either the door of heaven or <i>amṛta…</i> In the possession of wealth, rejoice, as before, with the <i>Sauvīra</i>-maidens, and be not ruled over by the <i>Saindhava</i>-maidens…Handed down by tradition from time immemorial, the eternal essence of <i>kṣatriya</i>-virtues (<i>kṣatrahṛdayaṃ</i>) has been ordained by <i>Prajāpati</i> himself… A <i>kṣatriya</i> should rather break than yield. He should bow down to <i>brahmans</i> only and to virtue (<i>dharmāya</i>); he should rule over all other orders, destroying all evil-doers” (V. <b>134</b>). The son complained that the heart of his mother was made of steel, and blamed the <i>kṣatriya</i>-practices. <i>Vidulā</i> said that if <i>Sañjaya</i> was about to be stained by infamy and she did not say it to him, her affection for him would be like that of a she-ass for her young. He ought to have recourse to virtue and profit (V, <b>135</b>)…“We have many treasure-houses unknown to thee…thou hast also more than one friend.” Despair left <i>Sañjaya's</i> heart, though he was not gifted with great intelligence. He roused himself and achieved all that his mother had pointed out. Indeed, this history, named <i>Jaya</i>, should be listened to by everyone desirous of victory, etc. (V, <b>136</b>)."
