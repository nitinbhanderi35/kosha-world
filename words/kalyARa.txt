But nobody was sure about the Devayāna path which leads to Heaven. So they selected Kalyāṇa to find out the path. He went in search of the Devayāna path and on the way he met Ūrṇāyu, a Gandharva who was in the company of some apsarā women. The gandharva disclosed the Sāma which would enable Kalyāṇa to find out the Devayāna path. On his return, Kalyāṇa told the other Ṛṣis that he had received the Sāma, but he refused to disclose from whom he obtained it. With the help of that Sāma known as Aurṇāyuva, the Aṅgirases attained Heaven, but because of his failure to disclose the whole truth, Kalyāṇa was denied access to Heaven. Besides that, he became a victim to the disease of leprosy. (Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇam)."
