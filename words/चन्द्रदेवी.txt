Hiranand Shastri takes the relevant legend to be <i>‘Śrīvainya-</i> <i>devyām’</i><sup>122</sup> but regards the correct reading to be <i>Candra</i> in place of <i>Vainya.</i><sup>123</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>No. 47 mentions Candradevī as the name of the mother of Narasiṃhagupta. <dvsn n='P'/>In No. 53 Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Budhagupta and wife of Pūrugupta. <dvsn n='P'/>The name Candradevī is based on the god Candra (Moon)."
