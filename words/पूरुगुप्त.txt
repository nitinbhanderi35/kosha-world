In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father and predecessor of Narasiṃhagupta is spelt as Pūrugupta.<sup>89</sup> The reading Pūrugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary Nālandā Seal of Narasiṃhagupta and is also fairly clear on the seals of Kumāragupta II. The medial <i>ū</i> sign in the first letter of the name Pūrugupta is indicated by an additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial <i>u</i> as in <i>puttras</i> in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name, viz. <i>ru.</i> the medial <i>u</i> is shown by a small hook turned to left and joined to the foot of <i>r.</i> Palaeographical considerations apart, the name Pur<i>u</i>gupta yields a more plausible-sense than Pur<i>a</i>gupta and fits better in the series of the grand and dignified names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz. <i>gupta,</i> which being family surname was a mere adjunct. <i>Pura,</i> by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while <i>Puru</i> is both. <i>Pūru</i> or its variant <i>Puru</i> may, like <i>Vainya</i> in Vainyagupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, or may mean abundant or great.<sup>90</sup>"
