            "content": "PRASENAJIT IV¦. A King who lived in the city of Śrāvastī. Once a very virtuous brahmin came to this city. Finding him to be a man of great virtues a Vaiśya took him to his house and kept him there worshipping him. Many rich men coming to know of the brahmin came and worshipped him with offerings of costly clothes and ornaments. Within a short time the poor brahmin got a huge heap of gold and silver. He collected his lot and at night without letting anybody know went and buried it in a secret place in the forest. After some days he went and looked for it and found his buried wealth missing. When the brahmin returned weeping, the host, the Vaiśya, gathered from him all that had happened. The house-holder consoled him but the miserly and greedy brahmin was not to be pacified thus and he started to commit suicide. He went to a pond nearby and was about to jump into it when Prasenajit who heard about this came to the spot and told him thus:—“Do not grieve over your loss. I shall make enquiries about it and if the stolen wealth is not recovered I shall give you compensation from my treasury.” <dvsn n='NI'/>After consoling the brahmin thus the King went to his palace. He pretended to be ill and called the physicians of the city to his side. He asked them about their patients, their illness and the medicines prescribed for them. One of the physicians during the enquiry said thus: “Oh lord, Mātṛdattavaṇik is my patient. Yesterday I prescribed to him the root of Ūraka plant.” The King soon dispersed the physicians and sent for Mātṛdattavaṇik and asked him who had brought for him the root. When Mātṛdattavaṇik replied that it was his servant the King sent for the servant and on questioning the servant the latter confessed having taken the hidden treasure. Thus because of the intelligence and wisdom of the King the brahmin got back his wealth. (Taraṅga 7, Madanamañcukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara)."
