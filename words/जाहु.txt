Since it is scarcely possible that the <lang>Vedic</lang> verb aj-, <i>drive</i> (away), is concerned ('jā = aja, hu = khalu, <i>drive them away like serpents!</i>), I believe that some form of hā, <i>abandon</i> (less likely of han, <i>smite</i>) must be involved; the ā might well be <ab>m.c.</ab> (meter requires two long syllables), but I cannot explain the final u (ū ?). Perhaps read jāhā = jaha, 2 <ab>sg.</ab> <lex>impv.</lex>, <i>abandon!</i> (?)]"
