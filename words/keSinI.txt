Both wagered their lives and accepted Prahlāda as their judge. The decision of Prahlāda was that the Brahmin was the nobler of the two. Because Prahlāda said the truth Sudhanvā did not kill Virocana. But Virocana had to wash the feet of Sudhanvā in the presence of Keśinī, feet Sudhanvā married Keśinī in the presence of Virocana. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 35)."
