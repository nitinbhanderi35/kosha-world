The kingdoms there are full of righteousness, and the men never die; there is no famine; the people are all full of forbearance and great energy. There are seven mountains decked with jewels, etc., and many rivers. The mountains are: (1) <i>Meru</i>, the abode of D., Ṛ., and G.; (2) <i>Malaya</i>, to the east; there the clouds are generated, and thence they disperse on all sides; (3) <i>Jaladhāra</i>, whence <i>Indra</i> daily takes water, and from that we get showers of rain; (4) <i>Raivataka</i>, over which the constellation <i>Revati</i> is placed by <i>Brahmán</i> himself; (5) on the north of this is <i>Śyāma</i>. Because the hue of these mountains is dark, the people residing there are all dark in complexion; (6) <i>Durga-</i> <i>śaila</i>; (7) <i>Keśarin</i> (B. <i>Kesara</i>). The measure of each of these mountains is double that of the one mentioned immediately before. There are seven <i>Varṣas</i> (β,) one for each mountain. In the midst is a large tree called <i>Śāka</i>, in height and breadth equal to the <i>Jambu</i>-tree in <i>Jambudvīpa</i>, and it is always adored by the people. There are many delightful provinces where <i>Śiva</i> is worshipped, and thither repair D., Si., and Cā. The people are virtuous, and all the four orders are devoted to their respective occupations. There is no instance of theft. They are free from decrepitude and death, and gifted with long life. The rivers (γ) are full of sacred water whence <i>Indra</i> draws water to shower it as rain. <i>Gaṅgā</i> herself is among them. They are all sin-cleansing. There are four sacred provinces (δ). There is no king and no punishment, and no person that deserves to be punished: VI, <b>11</b>, 408, 411, 413, 441.— § 623 (Rājadh.): XII, <b>14</b>α, 406 (east of Meru, swayed by Yudhiṣṭhira), 407."
