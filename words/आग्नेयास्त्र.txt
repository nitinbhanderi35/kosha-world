            "content": "<b>Āgneyāstra<sup>1</sup></b>¦ nt.: Name of a missile; referred to as Āgni-astra in <i>ubhe caivāgni-</i> <i>mārute</i> 5. 140. 6. <b>A.</b> Origin and succession: Arjuna told Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa that Bṛhaspati gave it first to Bharadvāja, Bharadvāja to sage Agniveśya, Agniveśya to Droṇa, and Droṇa to Arjuna 1. 158. 26-27; 1. 121. 6-7; but Arjuna told Uttara that he obtained Āgneyāstra from god Agni 4. 56. 14; when Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa expressed his desire to learn the <i>astra,</i> Arjuna taught it to him in exchange of the Gandharva horses (<i>gandhar-</i> <i>vajāḥ … hayāḥ</i> 1. 158. 51) 1. 158. 54-55; Arjuna taught it to the Gandharva with due rites (<i>yathāvidhi</i>) 1. 174. 3; when Arjuna requested Indra for heavenly weapons, Indra assured him that he would give him all the heavenly missiles, <i>āgneya</i> and the rest (<i>āgneyāni ca sarvāṇi</i>) after Arjuna had satisfied god Mahādeva 1. 225. 12, 10; among the epic heroes, besides Droṇa and Arjuna, its use was known also to Kṛṣṇa (6. 116. 38; also see <b>Āgneyāstra<sup>2</sup></b>), Bhīṣma, Karṇa and Aśvatthāman (7. 166. 2) [See the section <b>C</b> below]. <b>B.</b> Description: divine (<i>divya</i>) 6. 116. 38; 7. 73. 46; very dreadful (<i>mahā-</i> <i>ghora</i>) 7. 73. 46; very frightful (<i>sudāruṇa</i>) 4. 59. 21; irresistible even by the gods (<i>devair</i> <i>api sudurdharṣam</i>) 7. 172. 14. <b>C.</b> Its use in war and its effects: 1. In the epic war: (i) when used by Karṇa against Arjuna, it gave to Karṇa's bow a fiery look and it released fiery arrows; Arjuna apparently combated it with the same kind of <i>astra (astraṃ astreṇa saṃvārya</i>) 7. 31. 5152; (ii) used by Droṇa against Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); this was combated by Sātyaki with Vāruṇāstra 7. 73. 46; (iii) Bhāradvāja (Droṇa) used Āgneya and other heavenly missiles against Yudhiṣṭhira which were rendered ineffective by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 29-30; (iv) Aśvatthāman used it against Arjuna; when released, it produced a shower of arrows (<i>śaravarṣam ajāyata</i> 7. 172. 16; <i>śaravṛṣṭayaḥ</i> 7. 172. 22); cold winds blew, sun lost its lustre, clouds rained blood, all beings became restless; the arrows were fiery and produced good deal of heat; they burnt down enemies, elephants, horses and chariots; the god Fire burnt the army like the Saṃvartaka fire at the end of the aeon 7. 172. 16-27; the whole army, including Arjuna, could not be seen due to the darkness; the like of the <i>astra</i> released by Aśvatthāman was never seen before by Saṃjaya and his colleagues 7. 172. 30-31; Arjuna combated it with Brāhma Astra 7. 172. 14, 32; it was meant to be used by Arjuna in the war 5. 140. 6 (here referred to as Āgni instead of Āgneya). 2. Outside the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it against Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa; when released, it burnt down the excellent chariot of Aṅgāraparṇa, and he fell down, head downwards, as he swooned due to the lustre of the missile 1. 158. 28, 29, 37; (ii) used by Droṇa (besides using other divine missiles) against Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid; Arjuna combated it with his Āgneyāstra 4. 53. 48; (iii) on the same occasion used by Bhīṣma and Arjuna against each other to combat each other's missiles 4. 59. 21; (iv) in his fight with Citrasena and the Gandharvas Arjuna killed thousands of Gandharvas with Āgneyāstra 3. 234. 7; when released once again, the Gandharvas, afflicted by heat, were dejected 3. 234. 17; (v) at the time of displaying his skill in the use of missiles, Arjuna produced fire by releasing Āgneyāstra 1. 125. 19; (vi) employed by Bhīṣma against Rāma (Jāmadagnya); it was rendered ineffective by the counter-use of Vāruṇāstra 5. 181. 12. <b>D.</b> Mode of use: The normal arrows were supposed to be infused by this <i>astra</i> (<i>astre te vāruṇāgneye tābhyāṃ</i> <i>bāṇasamāhite</i> 7. 73. 48) by reciting <i>mantras</i> over it (<i>anumantrya</i> 5. 181. 12, <i>abhimantrya</i> 7. 172. 15); Aśvatthāman also sipped water (<i>vāry upaspṛśya</i> 7. 172. 14) before reciting <i>mantras.</i> <b>E.</b> Status: Inferior to Śivā's Pāśupatāstra 13. 14. 127."
