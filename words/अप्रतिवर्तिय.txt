In <lang>Pali</lang> apparently only appaṭi° occurs, and I believe this must have been the original reading. No being could <i>turn back</i> the wheel started by the Buddha. But evidently in <lang>BHS</lang> tradition this became confused with forms (<lex>ppp.</lex> as well as <lex>gdve.</lex>) of pra-, pari-vṛt-, which of course also yield a tolerable sense: <i>which had never been set in motion</i> or <i>could not be set in motion</i> by any (other) being."
