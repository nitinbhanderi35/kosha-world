One day seeing the handsome figure of Candra, Tārā became amorous. Candra was the Disciple of Bṛhaspati. It was not right on the part of the wife of the teacher to feel amorous towards a disciple. Bṛhaspati came to know of the affair and sending for Candra asked him to return his wife. Both Candra and Tārā did not pay any heed to Bṛhaspati. Both sides were about to engage in a battle. The devas arrayed themselves on both sides. Seeing that this was not an honourable thing some devas tried for a compromise. Finally Candra returned Tārā to Bṛhaspati. At this time Tārā was pregnant. Both Candra and Bṛhaspati claimed the paternity of the child in the womb of Tārā, who witnessed that Candra was the father of the child. All accepted the words of Tārā. Budha was the child Tārā gave birth to. <dvsn n='NI'/>2) <i>Marriage and birth of a child.</i> Budha grew up to be a youth.

Budha who was the incarnation of all vices drank too much and spent a whole night lying unconscious on the veranda of the house of a harlot. His father became anxious about him as he had not returned though the night had advanced much. He searched everywhere and finally came to the place where he was lying unconscious. He reviled the son, who getting angry killed his father then and there. <dvsn n='NI'/>After that he returned home. His mother advised him to leave off his vices. His wife shed tears before him. Seeing that his mother and wife were impediments on his way, he put an end to their lives. <dvsn n='NI'/>Once this Brāhmaṇa carried away Sulabhā the beautiful wife of hermit Kālabhūti and ravished her. Sulabhā cursed him and made him a leper. <dvsn n='NI'/>Budha wandered about and reached the city of King Śūrasena. On that day the King was about to go to Heaven with the entire city by aeroplane. However hard the pilots might try the plane would not move an inch. Then the devas told the King: “Drive away the leper there. The vices of that sinful murderer have made the plane stationary.” <dvsn n='NI'/>Śūrasena who was kind and righteous, neared the leper and cured him with caturākṣarīmantra (a spell of four letters) and got ready to take him also to heaven.
