As the year was about to expire, Kīcaka, the senāpati and brotherin-law of Virāṭa, became enamoured of Kṛṣṇā, who rebuked him and warned him of the Gandharvas, her husbands (IV, <b>14</b>). Then he caused Sudeṣṇā (<i>Kaikeyī</i>) to send Kṛṣṇā to him to fetch wine. Kṛṣṇā adored the Sun, who commanded a Rākṣasa to protect her invisibly (IV, <b>15</b>). As Kīcaka seized her, she dashed him to the ground and rushed to Yudhiṣṭhira, followed by Kīcaka, who brought her down and seized her by the hair, but the Rākṣasa gave him a puṣ, so that he fell down senseless. Yudhiṣṭhira, apprehensive of discovery, commanded Bhīmasena to forbear. Kṛṣṇā rebuked Virāṭa and was praised by the courtiers, but sent back to Sudeṣṇā by Yudhiṣṭhira: “the Gandharvas will surely dispel thy woe.” Sudeṣṇā said: “I shall cause Kīcaka to be slain, if thou wishest it.” Kṛṣṇā answered: “Even others will slay him” (IV, <b>16</b>). Kṛṣṇā rose up at night and proceeded to Bhīmasena (IV, <b>17</b>), and complained of their plight and especially that of Sahadeva (<i>b</i>) (IV, <b>18—21</b>). Bhīmasena exhorted her to endure a little longer, reminding her of Sukanyā, Indrasenā (<i>c</i>), Sītā, Lopāmudrā, and Sāvitrī (IV, <b>21</b>), and said: “To-morrow evening you should manage to have a meeting with Kīcaka in the dancing hall, but so that others may not espy thee.” Kīcaka came to the rendezvous and was slain by Bhīmasena, and Kṛṣṇā said to the keepers of the dancing-hall: “Kīcaka has been slain by my Gandharva husbands” (IV, <b>22</b>). Kīcaka's relatives obtained permission from Virāṭa to cremate Kṛṣṇā with him, and carried her towards the burning-place. She cried “Jaya”, etc. (α). Bhīmasena hearing it, came and slew 105 of them with a tree (IV, <b>23</b>). Virāṭa got afraid and caused Sudeṣṇā to ask Kṛṣṇā to leave the country, but she obtained permission to remain for thirteen days (IV, <b>24</b>)."
