At that time the real Sītā disappeared in Agni and in her place a false Sītā was installed. It was this phantom Sītā who was carried away by Rāvaṇa and who lived in Laṅkā till the time of Rāvaṇa's death. It was this Māyāsītā whom Rāma asked to jump into the fire to test her purity. At that time Māyāsītā disappeared and the real Sītā came out from the fire. (See under SĪTĀ)."
