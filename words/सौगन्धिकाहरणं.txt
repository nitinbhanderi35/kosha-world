Tīrthayātrāp.). § 431: When <i>Bhīma</i> was embraced by <i>Hanumat</i> his fatigue went off. <i>Hanumat</i> asked him not to tell anyone that he dwelt there; this was the time of the arrival of the gods and of the <i>Gandharvas</i> (cf. v. 11220); he declared himself willing if <i>Bhīma</i> might wish it to go to <i>Hāstinapura</i> and slay the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i>, etc., and dive into the army of his foes, giving leonine roars and remaining on the flagstaff of <i>Arjuna's</i> chariot. Then <i>Hanumat</i> vanished (III, <b>151</b>).—§ 432: Description of the proceeding of <i>Bhīma</i> along the <i>Gandhamādana</i> till he found the lotuses (III, <b>152</b>). Description of the lotus-lake, near <i>Kailāsa</i>, guarded by hundreds of thousands of <i>Rākṣasas</i> (called <i>Krodhavaśāḥ</i>), sprung from a cascade near the abode of <i>Kubera</i>, the sporting place of <i>Kubera</i>, frequented by <i>Gandharvas, Apsarases</i>, gods, divine <i>ṛṣis, Yakṣas, Kimpuru-</i> <i>ṣas, Rākṣasas</i>, and <i>Kinnaras. Bhīma</i> drank of the water (III, <b>153</b>). The <i>Krodhavaśas</i> ordered <i>Bhīma</i> to ask the permission of <i>Kubera</i> before he entered the lake; but <i>Bhīma</i> plunged into the water, and as the <i>Rākṣasas</i> attacked him, he slew 100 of them with his mace, inlaid with golden plates, and then drank of the water, by which his strength was fully restored, and gathered <i>saugandhika</i>-lotuses, while the <i>Krodhavaśas</i> fled through the sky to the peaks of <i>Kailāsa</i> and gave account to <i>Kubera</i>, who said: “Let <i>Bhīma</i> take as many lotuses as he likes.” The <i>Rākṣasas</i> then returned to <i>Bhīma</i> (III, <b>154</b>).—§ 433: As there arose a violent wind with gravel, meteors, thunder, darkness, earthquake, dust, and evil omens, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, having learned from <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> the depart of <i>Bhīma</i>, and alleging that <i>Bhīma</i> had not formerly done any wrong to the <i>Siddhas</i> (<i>siddhānāṃ brahma-</i> <i>vādināṃ</i>, v. 11415), resolved to find out <i>Bhīma</i> and let <i>Ghaṭotkaca</i> carry <i>Kṛṣṇā</i>, while other <i>Rākṣasas</i> carried the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the brahmans, and so they proceeded with <i>Lomaśa</i> to the lake, where the slaughtered <i>Yakṣas</i> were lying, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> entreated <i>Bhīma</i> never again to offend the gods; the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> began to sport in the lake, and the warders (i.e. the Rākṣasas), with rocks for weapons, bowed down in humility. There they dwelt for a short time on the slopes of <i>Gandhamādana</i>, expecting <i>Arjuna</i> (III, <b>155</b>). —§ 434: One day when <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, remembering the tīrthas, rivers (<i>Ilā</i>, etc.), etc., that they had visited, consulted with <i>Bhīma</i> how they should repair to the abode of <i>Vaiśravaṇa (b</i>), a voice from the sky said that they must first return to <i>Badarī</i> and thence to the hermitage of <i>Vṛṣaparvan(c</i>) and that of <i>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa</i>. There came a shower of blossoms. According to the counsel of <i>Dhaumya</i>, they all returned to the hermitage of <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (III, <b>156</b>)."
