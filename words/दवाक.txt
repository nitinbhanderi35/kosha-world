According to Fleet it was the ancient name of Dacca.<sup>533</sup> V.A. Smith takes it as corresponding to Bogra, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts.<sup>531</sup> But as these districts were not actually incorporated in the Gupta dominions, D.R. Bhandarkar suggests that Ḍavāka corresponds to the hill-tract of Chittagong and Tippera.<sup>535</sup> K. L. Barua identifieds it with Kopili valley in Assam.<sup>536</sup> Generally Ḍavāka is identified with modern Daboka in Nowgong district, Assam.<sup>537</sup> It thus corresponds to the valley of the Kapili and the Yamuna rivers in Nawgong district where we still find a place called Doboka.<sup>538</sup>"
