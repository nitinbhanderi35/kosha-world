Dey<sup>16</sup> identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra). Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.<sup>17</sup> According to R.D. Banerjee<sup>18</sup> Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in Kaliṅga. B.C. Law<sup>19</sup> identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Raychaudhuri,<sup>20</sup> S.B. Chaudhuri,<sup>21</sup> Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.<sup>22</sup> This view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas. Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tāmralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.<sup>23</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15): <dvsn n='P'/>L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to MūlaNāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that MūlaNāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.<sup>24</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a country of the Nāgas’."
