It is stated in Devībhāgavata, Skandha 7, as follows about the origin of this Solar dynasty. <dvsn n='NI'/>The Lord of creation Brahmā originated from the lotus in the navel of Viṣṇu. That Brahmā did penance for ten thousand years and pleased Parāśakti, the great goddess of power, and started creation. First of all he created seven mental sons. Of them Marīci became expert in creation. Prajāpati Kaśyapa the son of Marīci became a greater expert. The Sun is the son of Kaśyapa. Nine sons named Ikṣvāku, Nābhāga, Dhṛṣṭa, Śaryāti, Nariṣyanta, Prāṃśu, Nṛga, Diṣṭa, Karūṣa and Pṛṣadhra were born to the Sun. Of these Ikṣvāku became King. This line of Kings born from the Sun is called Sūryavaṃśa (Solar dynasty). (See the Genealogy)."
