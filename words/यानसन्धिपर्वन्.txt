After the night had passed away, all the princes and chiefs, <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (α) entered the court-hall (description) to hear the message of <i>Sañjaya</i> (adorned with ear-rings), who had come back from the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> by the aid of <i>Saindhava</i> steeds. <i>Sañjaya</i> related the salutations of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (V, <b>47</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> related that <i>Arjuna</i> (! cf. § 556: Sañjayayānap., V, <b>23—28</b>) had said, with <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> sanction, that <i>Sañjaya</i> should say to <i>Duryodhana</i> and <i>Karṇa</i>, threatening them with <i>Bhīmasena</i>, etc. (β), that if the <i>Dhārtarāṣṭras</i> desired war, then all the aims of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> were accomplished, as <i>Duryodhana</i> should lie down on the bare earth, deprived of life, etc. <i>Arjuna (b</i>) trusted himself and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (<i>c</i>); he said that <i>Duryodhana</i> often thought of imprisoning <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and sought to create a sudden disunion between <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i>. “There are with us many aged <i>brahmans</i>, versed in various sciences…who are prophesying the great destruction of the <i>Kurus</i> and the <i>Sṛñjayas</i>, and the ultimate victory of the <i>Pāṇḍavas…</i> thy bow <i>Gāṇḍīva</i> yawns without being handled, etc.; on the top of my flagstaff are heard terrific voices (‘when shall thy car be yoked, O <i>Kirīṭin?’</i>); innumerable jackals howl at night, and <i>Rākṣasas</i> frequently alight from the sky…I will use the <i>Sthūṇākarṇa, Pāśupata</i>, and <i>Brāhma</i> weapons, and all those that <i>Śakra</i> gave me.” [This speech of Arjuna is not found in § 556: Sañjayayānap.] (V, <b>48</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> said to <i>Duryodhana</i> that <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa (Nara-Nārāyaṇau</i>) (<i>d</i>) were <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>: it was with their aid that <i>Śakra</i> vanquished the <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Dānavas; Nara</i> slew hundreds and thousands of <i>Paulomas</i> and <i>Kālakañjas</i> in battle; <i>Arjuna</i>, with an arrow, severed the head of the <i>Asura Jambha</i> while the latter was about to swallow him; he afflicted <i>Hiraṇyapura</i> on the other side of the ocean, having vanquished in battle 60,000 of <i>Nivātakavacas</i>; and in the same way also <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> has, in this world, destroyed numberless other <i>Daityas</i> and <i>Dānavas. Karṇa</i> boasted that he would slay all the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> in battle, but was rebuked by <i>Bhīṣma</i>, saying that <i>Karṇa</i> had seen his own brother slain by <i>Arjuna</i> in the city of <i>Virāṭa</i>, and alluding to the contents of the Goharaṇa-, and the Ghoṣayātrāparvan. <i>Droṇa</i> also counselled peace, but got no answer from <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> (V, <b>49</b>). At the request of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> related that the <i>Pañcālas</i>, etc. (γ) looked up to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. As he was questioned about <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> and the <i>Somakas</i>, he first fell down in a swoon. Then, regarding <i>Bhīmasena (e</i>) he mentioned the lac-house, etc. (δ); regarding <i>Arjuna</i>, the burning of the <i>Khāṇḍava</i> forest, etc. (ε); then <i>Nakula (f</i>) and <i>Sahadeva (g); Śikhaṇḍin</i> (ζ); the five <i>Kekaya</i> princes, etc. (η) (V, <b>50</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was most afraid of <i>Bhīma</i> (who was taller than <i>Arjuna</i> by the span of the thumb), with his mace (full four cubits in length, with six sides), mentioning his killing <i>Jarāsandha</i> (V, <b>51</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was also afraid of <i>Arjuna</i>, who he feared would conquer <i>Karṇa</i> (being compassionate and heedless), and <i>Droṇa</i> (being aged and having affection for his pupil Arjuna); “thirtythree years have passed since the burning of the <i>Khāṇḍava</i> forest; we have never heard of his being defeated anywhere” [but cf. the reading of B. <i>trayastṛṃśat samāhūya</i>, i.e. challenging the thirty-three gods] (V, <b>52</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was afraid of the allies of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>: the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, <i>Kekayas</i>, etc. (θ) (V, <b>53</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> rebuked <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> for his behaviour towards the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; “the <i>Matsyas</i>, etc. (ι) all decline to pay thee homage now” (V, <b>54</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> said, that when the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> had been exiled, there came to them <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (κ), all assembled in a place not far from <i>Indraprastha</i>, and suggested to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that he should take back the kingdom; “the people of the realm were all annoyed with us, and all our friends also were angry with us”; but <i>Bhīṣma, Kṛpa</i>, and <i>Aśvatthāman</i> had despised the foes (“inflamed with anger at the death of his father this <i>Bhīṣma</i>, in days of old, had conquered all the kings of the earth, in a single chariot”). “Now the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> are without allies; and all these kings can, for my sake, enter the fire or the sea…Having given up all hopes of a town, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> craves only five villages…There is none on earth equal to me in an encounter with the mace. In battle, I am <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa's</i> equal; I will certainly slay <i>Bhīma</i>, <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (λ), every one of these is singly capable of slaying the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>.” He alluded to the superhuman circumstances concerning <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (μ), to the resolution of the <i>Saṃśaptakas</i> to slay <i>Arjuna</i> or be slain by him; “our chief warriors are <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ν); they have seven <i>akṣauhiṇīs</i>, we have eleven; <i>Bṛhaspati</i> has said, that an army which is less by one-third ought to be encountered” (V, <b>55</b>). At the request of <i>Duryodhana, Sañjaya</i> described the chariots of <i>Arjuna (h), Yudhiṣṭhira (i), Bhīmasena (j</i>), <i>Sahadeva (k), Nakula (l</i>); “and excellent steeds, presented by the celestials, carry the sons of <i>Subhadrā</i> and <i>Draupadī</i>” (V, <b>56</b>). At the request of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> mentioned the allies of the <i>Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (ξ), and who had been assigned to each of them as his share: <i>Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma</i>; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> & the <i>Madra</i> king; <i>Bhīmasena & Duryodhana's</i> sons and 100 brothers, the rulers of the east and the south; <i>Arjuna & Karṇa, Jayadratha</i>, etc.; the five <i>Kekayas</i> & the <i>Kekayas, Mālavas, Śālvakas, Trigartau Saṃśaptakau</i>; <i>Abhimanyu & Duryodhana's</i> sons (?), <i>Duḥśāsana's</i> sons, king <i>Bṛhadbala; Draupadeyāḥ + Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa</i>; <i>Cekitāna & Somadatta; Sātyaki & Kṛtavarman; Sahadeva</i> <i>& Śakuni; Nakula & Ulūka, Sārasvatāḥ</i>. All the other kings had been distributed in their respective shares. Thus the <i>Pāṇḍava</i> host had been distributed into divisions. <i>Virāṭa</i> with all his <i>Matsya</i> warriors would support <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> was exceedingly afraid of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (ο), <i>Duryodhana</i> said that <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (π) were invincible. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> maintained that <i>Bhīṣma</i> did not wish a battle. <i>Sañjaya</i> said that <i>Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> was always urging the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to fight, and professed that he would alone encounter all the assembled kings: <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ρ), and his words were approved by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira; Dhṛṣṭadyumna</i> had told <i>Sañjaya</i> to say to the <i>Kurus</i>, etc. (σ), that they ought not to suffer themselves to be slain by <i>Arjuna</i>, who was protected by the celestials; they should send a good man to <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> and entreat him to accept the kingdom. [This is not found in Sañjayayānap., § 556] (V, <b>57</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> mentioned that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> led the <i>brahmacarya</i> mode of life from his very youth, and saying that he himself, etc. (τ) did not applaud war, he urged <i>Duryodhana</i> to desist from hostilities and give back to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> their kingdom, saying, that it was <i>Karṇa, Duḥśāsana</i>, and <i>Śakuni</i> who led <i>Duryodhana</i> astray. <i>Duryodhana</i> answered that, without depending upon <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. (υ), he and <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duḥśāsana</i> would perform, in honour of <i>Yama</i>, a sacrifice in battle and slay the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; he said that he would sacrifice his life rather than surrender to the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> even that much of land which may be covered by the sharp point of a needle. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> said that he abandoned <i>Duryodhana</i> for ever, and grieved for the kings who would be crushed by <i>Yuyudhāna</i>, etc. (ϕ) (V, <b>58</b>). At the request of <i>Dhṛta-</i> <i>rāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> related how he had entered the inner apartments (description) in order to inform <i>Arjuna</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>; he had seen two straight lines on <i>Arjuna's</i> foot-soles. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> had threatened the <i>Kurus</i>, mentioning that <i>Kṛṣṇā</i> had invoked him with tears, and that D., As., men, Y., G., and N. were incapable of encountering <i>Arjuna</i> in battle, and alluding to his exploits in the city of <i>Virāṭa</i> (v. Goharaṇap.) (V, <b>59</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> represented to <i>Duryodhana</i> that <i>Agni</i> would help <i>Arjuna</i>, remembering what was done to him at <i>Khāṇḍava</i>, that <i>Dharma</i>, etc., would help the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> from parental affection, that <i>Arjuna</i> took up 500 arrows at a time, that <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ω) regarded him as invincible, and said he desired peace (V, <b>60</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i>, inflamed with wrath, said that according to <i>Vyāsa, Nārada</i>, and <i>Paraśu-Rāma</i>, the gods never engaged in work; if <i>Agni, Vāyu, Dharma, Indra</i>, or the <i>Aśvins</i> had ever engaged in work, the <i>Pārthas</i> could never have fallen into distress, and they and the <i>Maruts</i> would not venture to protect his foes; “charmed by me, <i>Agni</i> will be instantly extinguished…,my energy is greater than that of the gods;…it is I who set agoing all the affairs of both gods and <i>Asuras</i>…; neither D. nor G., nor As. nor Rā. are capable of saving him who has incurred my displeasure…; thou wilt hear of the defeat of the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (ψ);…whatever knowledge of weapons there is in <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (ω), exists in me as well” (V, <b>61</b>). <i>Karṇa</i> said to <i>Duryodhana</i>, mentioning the curse of <i>Paraśu-Rāma</i>, when he, by a lie, obtained the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon from him, that he would slay the <i>Pāñcālas</i>, etc. (αα). <i>Bhīṣma</i> mentioned the <i>Khāṇḍava</i> forest, and said that the dart which <i>Karṇa</i> had got from <i>Indra</i>, would be reduced to ashes by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> with his discus, and that his other shaft (having a head like a serpent), which he respectfully worshipped with flowery garlands, would be destroyed by <i>Arjuna</i> because he was protected by <i>Kṛṣṇa. Karṇa</i> made the pledge not to fight before <i>Bhīṣma's</i> fall, and went to his own abode. <i>Bhīṣma</i> ridiculed <i>Karṇa's</i> boasting before the kings of <i>Avanti</i>, etc. (ββ) (V, <b>62</b>). <i>Duryodhana</i> boasted; <i>Vidura</i> praised self-restraint (V, <b>63</b>). <i>Vidura</i> related that once two birds had flown away with the net in which they were caught, but were again caught when they began to quarrel. “So it is also with kinsmen. Once we, with some hunters and <i>brahmans</i> conversant with magic and charms, repaired to the northern mountain <i>Gandhamādana</i>, with excellent medicinal herbs, and inhabited by Si. and G. There was, on a precipice, some honey, <i>Kubera's</i> favourite drink, guarded by poisonous snakes; the <i>brahmans</i> said that a mortal drinking of it would win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight, and an old man would become a youth. The hunters desired to obtain it, and all perished. So it is with <i>Duryodhana</i>. In a single chariot <i>Arjuna</i> conquered the whole earth; <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>, etc. were routed by him at the city of <i>Virāṭa</i>. Remember also <i>Drupada</i> and the king of the <i>Matsyas</i>” (V, <b>64</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> warned <i>Duryodhana</i> against the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (γγ), and recommended him to follow <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (δδ) as his guides, mentioning the combat at the city of <i>Virāṭa</i> (V, <b>65</b>). At the request of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, <i>Sañjaya</i> related that <i>Arjuna</i> had said that <i>Bhīṣma</i>, etc. (εε) were all on the eve of death, if they did not give up to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> his own share of the kingdom (V, <b>66</b>). As <i>Duryodhana</i> showed little regard for the words of <i>Sañjaya</i>, and the rest remained silent, the assembled kings rose and retired. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, who always followed the counsels of his son, began to inquire in secret of <i>Sañjaya</i> about the resolves of his own party and of the foes. <i>Sañjaya</i> caused him to let <i>Vidura</i> introduce <i>Vyāsa</i> and <i>Gāndhārī</i> (V, <b>67</b>). <i>Sañjaya</i> extolled <i>Kṛṣṇa (m</i>), and mentioned some of those whom he had vanquished (ζζ) (V, <b>68</b>). Discourse between <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> and <i>Sañjaya</i> on the attributes of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> told <i>Duryodhana</i> to seek refuge with <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. <i>Duryodhana</i> refused. <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> complained of him to <i>Gāndhārī. Gāndhārī</i> threatened <i>Duryodhana</i> with <i>Bhīmasena</i>. <i>Vyāsa</i> recommended to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> to seek salvation through <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. Requested by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> explained the path of salvation through <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (V, <b>69</b>). At the request of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya</i> enumerated some names of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (V, <b>70</b>). <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> complained that he could not see <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, whom he extolled under several names (ηη) (V, <b>71</b>)."
