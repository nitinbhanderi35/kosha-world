Rājadharmānuśāsana). § 621: After the completion of the water rites by the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (α), many <i>Brahmarṣis</i>, etc. (β), came to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira. Nārada</i> congratulated <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> upon his success. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> lamented the loss of his kinsmen (γ); <i>Yudhiṣthira</i> at the match of dice had wondered seeing that <i>Karṇa's</i> feet resembled the feet of <i>Kuntī</i>; he inquired of <i>Nārada</i>, why the earth had swallowed up the wheels of <i>Karṇa's</i> chariot (XII, <b>1</b>). <i>Nārada</i> recited to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> the story of <i>Kaṛna's</i> pupilage with <i>Droṇa</i> and <i>Rāma</i> (among G., Rā., Y., and D.) and the curse called down upon him by a brahman whose cow <i>Karṇa</i> had inadvertently slain (δ) (XII, <b>2</b>); then the story of <i>Karṇa's</i> extraordinary powers of endurance, in consequence of which his real caste became known to <i>Rāma</i> (who had taught him the <i>Brāhma</i> weapon), who thereupon cursed him for his deceit; the worm <i>Alarka</i> was an Asura named <i>Daṃśa</i>, who in the <i>Kṛta</i> age had ravished the spouse of <i>Bhṛgu</i> and been cursed by him, until he should be liberated by <i>Paraśu-Rāma. Karṇa</i>, arriving before <i>Duryo-</i> <i>dhana</i>, told him: “I have mastered every weapon” (XII, <b>3</b>). <i>Nārada</i> said: “To a self-choice at <i>Rājapura</i>, the capital of the <i>Kāliṅga</i> king <i>Citrāṅgada Duryodhana</i> (with <i>Karṇa</i>), <i>Śiśupāla</i>, etc. (ε), repaired; the maiden (who was accompanied by her nurse and a guard of eunuchs) passed by <i>Duryodhana</i>, who then (relying upon <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Droṇa</i>) took her up on his chariot and abducted her by force. <i>Karṇa</i>, riding on his chariot, proceeded in <i>Duryodhana's</i> rear. The kings pursued <i>Karṇa</i> and <i>Duryodhana</i>; but <i>Karṇa</i> made them all turn away, and <i>Duryodhana</i> reached <i>Hāstinapura</i> with the maiden” (XII, <b>4</b>). <i>Nārada</i> said: “The <i>Māgadha</i> king <i>Jarāsandha</i> challenged <i>Karṇa</i> to a single combat; at last they fought with bare arms, and <i>Karṇa</i> was about to sever the two portions of <i>Jarāsandha's</i> body that had been united together by <i>Jarā</i>; then <i>Jarāsandha</i> gave up all desire of hostility and gave unto <i>Karṇa</i> the town <i>Mālinī</i> (i.e. <i>Campā</i>). From that time he ruled over <i>Campā</i> and the <i>Aṅgas</i> agreeably to the wishes of <i>Duryodhana</i>.” Allusions to XII, <b>2, 3</b>, etc. (ζ) (XII, <b>5</b>). D.-ṛ. <i>Nārada</i> became silent; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> grieved; <i>Kuntī</i> comforted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> by telling him that neither she nor <i>Sūrya</i> could dissuade <i>Karṇa</i> from fighting the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> (XII, <b>6</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> lament (η) before <i>Arjuna</i>; he wished to renounce the sovereignty (XII, <b>7</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> addressed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, justifying war and approving of the acquisition of wealth, quoting <i>Nahuṣa</i> (who cried fie on the state of poverty, in which he had done many wicked acts, and which is for recluses and <i>Ṛ</i>.), and citing the conduct of the gods and Dā., which is sanctioned by the <i>Vedas</i>; “this earth formerly belonged to king <i>Dilīpa</i>, etc. (θ); she now belongs to thee; a great sacrifice awaits thee; if thou dost not perform this sacrifice, the sins of this kingdom shall all be thine; those subjects whose king performs a horse-sacrifice…all become pure,” as shown by the example of <i>Mahādeva (Śiva (b)</i>); “this is the great path called <i>Dāśaratha</i> (affording place for ten waggons, i.e. the sacrifice [Nīl.])” (XII, <b>8</b>). Unmoved by <i>Arjuna's</i> words, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> desired to lead the life of a religious recluse (XII, <b>9</b>). <i>Bhīma's</i> address to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> commending sovereignty (XII, <b>10</b>).—§ 622: <i>Arjuna</i> recited the story of the discourse between <i>Śakra</i> (in the shape of a golden bird) and certain youths (Ṛ.) desirous of leading a forest life (XII, <b>11</b>). —§ 623: <i>Nakula</i> addressed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, blaming renunciation and commending the life of a householder (XII, <b>12</b>). <i>Sahadeva</i> recommended to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> a life of action with the soul free from attachments (XII, <b>13</b>). <i>Draupadī</i> reminded <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> of his former counsels (α) (XII, <b>14</b>). <i>Arjuna</i> praised him who wields the rod of chastisement; “<i>Indra</i>, by the slaughter of <i>Vṛtra</i>, became the great <i>Indra</i>; those among the gods that are given to slaughtering others are adored much more by men; <i>Rudra</i>, etc. (β) are all slaughterers; all people bend to these gods, but not to <i>Brahmán</i> or <i>Dhātṛ</i> or <i>Pūṣan</i> at any time, except a few men of noble disposition” (XII, <b>15</b>). <i>Bhīma's</i> second address to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (γ), urging him to subdue his grief (XII, <b>16</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> exposed the folly of earthly enjoyments quoting <i>Janaka</i> (observant of the religion of <i>mokṣa</i>): “my treasures are immense; yet I possess nothing; if again the whole of <i>Mithilā</i> were burnt, nothing of mine will be burnt” (XII, <b>17</b>).—§ 624: <i>Arjuna</i> recited the story of the discourse between the <i>Videha</i> king <i>Janaka</i> (who had shaved his head) and his queen (the princess of <i>Kośala</i>), in which the latter explained the claims of a life of poverty and renunciation (XII, <b>18</b>).—§ 625: <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira's</i> reply to <i>Arjuna</i> on the vanity of wealth (XII, <b>19</b>). —§ 626: <i>Devasthāna</i> pointed out to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> that the period had not come when he could retire into the woods (α) (XII, <b>20</b>), and recommended the assumption of sovereignty with his soul freed from attachment, quoting a discourse which <i>Bṛhaspati</i> delivered to <i>Indra</i>; the Ṛ., etc., adopt the religion of Exertion (not Emancipation), and attain to heaven through their acts (XII, <b>21</b>).—§ 627: <i>Arjuna</i> justified before <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> the slaughter of foes in battle: “<i>Indra</i>, himself, though a brahman, became a <i>kṣatriya</i> in his acts, and battled with his sinful kinsfolk 810 times” (XII, <b>22</b>).—§ 628: <i>Vyāsa</i> dissuaded <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> from a life of retirement and commended a life of domesticity, quoting a verse of <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (“like a snake devouring mice, the Earth devours a king that is inclined to peace and a <i>brahman</i> that is exceedingly attached to domesticity”), and reciting the story of R.-ṛ. <i>Sudyumna</i>: the brothers <i>Śaṅkha</i> and <i>Likhita</i> dwelled in two separate dwellings on the banks of <i>Bāhudā</i>; once, when <i>Śaṅkha</i> had gone out, <i>Likhita</i> came to his asylum and ate many ripe fruits. <i>Śaṅkha</i> told him to confess to the king and ask him to inflict on him the punishment of a thief. King <i>Sudyumna</i> would pardon him; but <i>Likhita</i> would not; <i>Sudyumna</i> then caused his hands to be cut off; <i>Likhita</i>, having asked pardon of <i>Śaṅkha</i>, was told by him to gratify D., Ṛ., and P. at <i>Bāhudā</i>, upon which two hands grew out. <i>Śaṅkha</i> said that he was not his chastiser, “but the king has been himself purified, as also thyself, along with P.” That king became eminent by this act and obtained the highest success (XII, <b>23</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> exhorted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to grant the wishes of his brothers, perform sacrifices, and imitate the great monarchs of old, especially <i>Hayagrīva (b</i>) (XII, <b>24</b>).—§ 629: Hearing the words of <i>Vyāsa</i> and seeing <i>Arjuna</i> angry, <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> declared to <i>Vyāsa</i> that earthly rule could give him no delight. <i>Vyāsa</i> answered, pointing out the virtues of Time, quoting “the old story recited by king <i>Senajit</i> in grief”. “Engaging in battle has been said to be the sacrifice for a king; a due observance of the science of chastisement is his <i>yoga</i>; and the gift of wealth in sacrifices in the shape of <i>dakṣiṇā</i> is his renunciation; all this should be regarded as acts that sanctify him” (XII, <b>25</b>).—§ 630: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> reply to <i>Arjuna</i> recommending a life of <i>yoga</i> and austerities; this is the practice of R., regarded by D. as <i>brahmans</i>; this is the opinion of the <i>Vaikhānasas</i>; the <i>Ajāḥ</i>, etc. (α) have all gone to heaven by means of <i>Vedic</i> study; by performing the acts indicated in the <i>Vedas</i>, battle, sacrifices, study of the <i>Vedas</i>, restrainment of passion, one goes to heaven by the southern path of the Sun; the northern path is travelled by those devoted to <i>yoga</i>, and is much applauded by those conversant with the <i>Purāṇas</i>; “one acquires heaven through contentment,” citing the discourse of <i>Yayāti</i> of old (XII, <b>26</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> censured himself for his cupidity and for the slaughter he caused of his kinsmen (β); <i>Bhīṣma</i> had, by the energy of his weapons, burnt <i>Ugrāyudha</i>, etc.; <i>Vyāsa</i> comforted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> by explaining the action of Destiny, and exhorted him to work (XII, <b>27</b>).—§ 631: <i>Vyāsa</i> recited “the old story, that is known by the name of <i>Aśman's</i> discourse”: the <i>Videha</i> king <i>Janaka</i>, filled with sorrow, questioned the wise <i>brahman Aśman</i> as to how a man should behave upon occasions of the accession and the destruction of both kinsmen and wealth. <i>Aśman</i> said that Destiny and Time are inevitable; “no person can see either heaven or hell; the scriptures, however, are the eyes of the virtuous; frame thy conduct according to the scriptures.” <i>Janaka</i> became freed from grief; “enjoy the earth, O son of <i>Kuntī!</i>” (XII, <b>28</b>).—§ 632: <i>Arjuna</i> asked <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (who from his earliest years was dearer to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> than even <i>Arjuna</i> himself) to dispel <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> grief. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> asked <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> not to grieve for men who died heroically in battle in the observance of <i>kṣatriya</i> duties, quoting the <i>Ṣoḍaśarājopā-</i> <i>khyāna (b</i>), i.e. the old discourse of <i>Nārada</i> before <i>Sṛñjaya</i> when the latter was deeply afflicted with grief on account of the death of his son. <i>Sṛñjaya</i> was freed from grief, and <i>Nārada</i> gave back to him his son <i>Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin</i>, whom <i>Parvata</i> had given him, and who had been bereft of life; that child should live 1,000 years (XII, <b>29</b>).—§ 633: Requested by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa</i> told <i>Nārada-Parvatopākhyāna (b</i>) (XII, <b>30</b>).—§ 634: Thereafter <i>Nārada</i> told <i>Suvarṇasṭhīvi-</i> <i>sambhavopākhyāna (b</i>) (XII, <b>31</b>).—§ 635: <i>Vyāsa</i> exhorted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to shake off his grief and assume the reins of sovereignty. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> feared that the guilt of slaughter had stained him; <i>Vyāsa</i> repeated his observations on Destiny (XII, <b>32</b>); as <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> still was remorseful (α), <i>Vyāsa</i> repeated his observations on Time, and pointed to expiatory rites, illustrating the case by the war of 32,000 years, by which the gods, having slain Dai., gained possession of heaven, and slew 88,000 brahmans called <i>Śālāvṛkāḥ</i> who had joined the Dā.; “thou hast only followed the path formerly trodden by the very gods; men like you never go to hell.” He recommended a horse-sacrifice as an expiation, mentioning that <i>Indra</i>, assisted by the <i>Maruts</i>, gradually performed 100 sacrifices and became <i>Śatakratu</i>, and is adored in the heavens by Aps., Ṛ., and D. (XII, <b>33</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i> discoursed on expiation and indicated the acts for which there should be expiation, citing the sage <i>Uddālaka</i>, who caused his son <i>Śvetaketu</i> to be begotten by disciple, etc. (XII, <b>34</b>), and declared that by penances, religious rites, and gifts one may wash off sins if one does not commit them anew, and indicated diverse kinds of expiation for diverse kinds of sins (XII, <b>35</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa</i> declared what food is clean and what is unclean (XII, <b>36</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> desired to hear of the duties of kings and of the four different orders. <i>Vyāsa</i>, casting his eyes on <i>Nārada</i>, directed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to apply to <i>Bhīṣma</i> for discourses on kingly duties, as <i>Bhīṣma</i>, having gratified D.-ṛ. with Bṛh, at their head, had acquired a knowledge of the duties of kings, and of that science, with its interpretations, that <i>Uśanas</i> and <i>Bṛhaspati</i> know; and a knowledge of all the <i>Vedas</i> with their branches, from <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> and <i>Cyavana</i> of <i>Bhṛgu's</i> race; in olden days he studied under <i>Sanatkumāra</i> (the eldest-born son of <i>Brahmán</i>); he learned the duties of the <i>Yatis</i> from <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i>; and obtained all weapons from <i>Rāma</i> and <i>Indra</i>; although childless, yet he has many regions of bliss before himself; B.-ṛ. were always his courtiers. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> was ashamed to approach <i>Bhīṣma. Kṛṣṇa</i> exhorted <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to rise up, shaking off his grief (β). Thus addressed by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (γ), <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> gave up his grief and anxiety, and with his brothers and the other kings, headed by <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, set out for <i>Hāstinapura</i>. The procession described (δ) (XII, <b>37</b>). The citizens welcomed <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Draupadī</i>, etc. (ε). <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i> entered the palace with <i>Dhaumya</i> and <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, and was blessed by the <i>brahmans</i>, but cursed by <i>Cārvāka</i>, a Rā. who had disguised himself as a <i>brahman</i>, and a friend of <i>Duryodhana</i>; the <i>brahmans</i> killed <i>Cārvāka</i> by uttering the mere sound <i>huṃ</i> (XII, <b>38</b>).—§ 636: <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> related: In the <i>Kṛta</i> age Rā. <i>Cārvāka</i> performed penances in <i>Badarī</i>; at last he solicited from <i>Brahmán</i> the boon of immunity from fear at the hands of every being in the universe, which <i>Brahmán</i> granted him, only with the limitation that he should be careful not to offend <i>brahmans</i>. Then he began to cause trouble to the gods; <i>Brahmán</i> predicted <i>Cārvāka's</i> friendship with <i>Duryodhana</i>, and that he would insult the <i>brahmans</i> (XII, <b>39</b>).—§ 637: The ceremony of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> installation on the throne described (α); he made gifts to the <i>brahmans</i>, who all blessed him and his brothers (XII, <b>40</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> answered and enjoined respect for his aged uncle, disposed of the high appointments of state (β) (XII, <b>41</b>), and caused the obsequial rites (<i>śrāddha</i>) to be performed in honour of the slaughtered heroes (γ), and performed acts of kindness to the ladies, widowed in the battle, the destitute, the blind, and helpless (XII, <b>42</b>). Then he adored <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (XII, <b>43</b>), and assigned to his brothers proper residences from among the palaces of the <i>Kuru</i> princes slain in battle (δ). They passed a happy night in their respective abodes, and in the morning presented themselves before king <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (XII, <b>44</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> gifts to diverse persons (ε). Then he addressed <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (with the <i>Kaustubha</i>), whom he found rapt in meditation (XII, <b>45</b>); he uttered a hymn to <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, who awoke and praised <i>Bhīṣma</i> (ζ), asking <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to resort to <i>Bhīṣma</i> for instruction. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> requested <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to grant <i>Bhīṣma</i> the sight of his divine person. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> caused <i>Sātyaki</i> to let <i>Dāruka</i> yoke his chariot with <i>Sugrīva</i> and <i>Śaibya</i>, etc. (XII, <b>46</b>). Description of the bed of arrows on which <i>Bhīṣma</i> lay, surrounded by Ṛ. <i>Vyāsa</i>, etc. (η). <i>Bhīṣma</i> hymned <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (θ). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> moved by <i>Bhīṣma's</i> adorations, bestowed upon him heavenly knowledge compassing the Past, the Present, and the Future, and went away. Those holy brahmans adored <i>Bhīṣma</i> and <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>. Seeing the devotion of <i>Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa</i> suddenly rose from his seat and ascended his chariot with <i>Sātyaki; Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> mounted another; <i>Bhīmasena</i> and the twins a third; <i>Kṛpa, Yuyutsu</i>, and <i>Sañjaya</i> on their respective chariots (XII, <b>47</b>).—§ 638: Then <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (α), proceeded to <i>Kurukṣetra</i> (description). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> pointed out to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> the five lakes of <i>Rāma Bhārgava</i>. Requested by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> (XII, <b>48</b>), <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> related: <i>Rāmopākhyāna (b</i>). Then he proceeded quietly in his chariot (XII, <b>49</b>).—§ 639: <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> eulogy of <i>Rāma</i> (α). Beholding from a distance the spot on which <i>Bhīṣma</i> lay (on the banks of the river <i>Oghavatī</i>), <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc. (β), descended from their chariots and approached and saluted the Ṛ. (headed by <i>Vyāsa</i>). Seeing <i>Bhīṣma</i> on the point of death, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> addressed him kindly (γ), and eulogized him (“competent to subjugate D., G., As., Y., and Rā.; spoken of by <i>brahmans</i> as the ninth of the <i>Vasus</i>; knowing the knowledge of the <i>cāturhotra</i>—v. BR.—and the <i>Sāṅkhya</i> and <i>Yoga</i>, etc., the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Purāṇas</i>”) (XII, <b>50</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> saluted <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (δ), and beheld his eternal form. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> said that it was owing to <i>Bhīṣma's</i> devotion that he had displayed his celestial form to him; “those regions, O king! are ready for thee whence there is no return; fifty-six days still remain for thee to live; when <i>Sūrya</i> turns to his northerly course, you shall go there; D. and V., riding on their chariots, are waiting for thee invisibly.” <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> asked <i>Bhīṣma</i> to instruct <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, etc.; “when thou wilt leave this world for that, all knowledge will expire with thee” (XII, <b>51</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> alleged physical weakness and mental darkness as reasons for his inability to obey <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, and he also hesitated to speak in <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> presence. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> removed <i>Bhīṣma's</i> pain and granted him power to recollect everything and behold the universe like a fish in a limpid stream. M.-ṛ. with <i>Vyāsa</i> adored <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> with words, accompanied by <i>Ṛc, Yojus</i>, and <i>Sāman</i> verses; celestial flowers fell, and Aps. sang, etc. At sunset the M.-ṛ., rising up, saluted <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. Upon this, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (etc.) (ε), returned to <i>Hāstinapura</i>, after having saluted <i>Bhīṣma</i>, saying that they would return next day (description) (XII, <b>52</b>). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> passed the night happily, performed his morning rites, and was welcomed with music and song at early dawn; asked by <i>Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki</i> saw <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and apprised him of <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> readiness to accompany him into the presence of <i>Bhīṣma. Yudhiṣṭhira</i> asked <i>Arjuna</i> to see that his chariot was made ready; then he, with the twins, etc. (ζ), proceeded to <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> abode. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, accompanied by <i>Sātyaki</i>, mounted his chariot, yoked with <i>Balāhaka</i>, etc. (η), urged by <i>Dāruka</i>. The princes set out. Arrived near <i>Bhīṣma</i> (surrounded by M.-ṛ.), <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, etc. (θ), alighting from their chariots, saluted Ṛ. by raising their right hands. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> approached <i>Bhīṣma</i>, eying him timidly (XII, <b>53</b>).—§ 640: Many Ṛ. and Sā., etc. (α), came to <i>Bhīṣma</i>. <i>Nārada</i> urged the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> to take advantage of the short span of life still left to <i>Bhīṣma</i> for soliciting him to discourse on morality. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> requested <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> to put questions to <i>Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma's</i> cheerful answer. He enquired of <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> why he was desired to discourse on morality and the duties of kings, <i>Kṛṣṇa's</i> divine self being best fitted to do so; <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> explained that his motive was only the enhancement of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> glory; “thou hast always worshipped Ṛ. and D.” (XII, <b>54</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> consented to discourse on morality and duty, and desired <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to question him. <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> introduced <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to <i>Bhīṣma</i>, who comforted <i>Yudhi-</i> <i>ṣṭhira</i>, saying that what he had done he had done in observance of <i>kṣatriya</i> duties. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> humbly approached <i>Bhīṣma</i> and touched his feet; <i>Bhīṣma</i>, kissing his head, asked him to take a seat and question him without anxiety (XII, <b>55</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> solicited <i>Bhīṣma</i> to discourse on kingly duties which are regarded as the root of all other duties in the world. <i>Bhīṣma</i>, bowing to <i>Dharma</i>, <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> (who is <i>Bráhman</i> in full), and the <i>brahmans</i>, set forth the general duties of kings (“as regards Ṛ. also, truth is their great wealth”); he quoted two <i>ślokas</i> of <i>Manu</i>: “fire has sprung from water, the <i>kṣatriya</i> from the <i>brahman</i>, and iron from stone; these three can exert their force on every other thing; but on their origins (<i>yoniṣu</i>), it is extinguished (<i>śāmyati</i>)”; and two <i>ślokas</i> of M.-ṛ. <i>Uśanas</i> (a <i>brahman</i> who rushes to battle may be chastised by a <i>kṣatriya</i>); and a <i>śloka</i> of <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (according to B.) (a king should not always be mild, nor always fierce) (XII, <b>56</b>). Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse, enjoining readiness for action on kings; quoting a <i>śloka</i> sung by <i>Uśanas</i> (“like a snake swallowing up mice”; cf. ch. <b>23</b>); and one by king <i>Marutta</i>, agreeably to <i>Bṛhaspati's</i> opinion; <i>Bāhu's</i> son, king <i>Sagara</i>, who exiled his eldest son <i>Asamañjas</i>, who used to drown the children of the citizens in the <i>Sarayū</i>; Ṛ. <i>Uddālaka</i> who cast off his favourite son <i>Śvetaketu</i>, because the latter used to invite <i>brahmans</i> with deceptive promises of entertainment. The king should administer justice like <i>Yama</i> and amass wealth like <i>Kubera</i>. He quoted a verse sung in days of old by <i>Bhārgava</i> [i.e. <i>Vālmīki</i> (cf. Hopkins, p. 61)], in the narrative called <i>Rāmacarita</i>, on king[ly duties] (“one should first select a king; then should he select a wife, and then earn wealth; if there be no king, what would become of his wife and acquisitions?” (XII, <b>57</b>). Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse, inculcating that protection is the very essence of kingly duties, quoting <i>Bṛhaspati</i>, etc. (β), and verses sung by <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (“by exertion the <i>amṛta</i> was obtained, by exertion the <i>Asuras</i> were slain,” etc.). <i>Vyāsa</i>, etc. (γ), expressed their delight with the discourse. Ṛ. and the princes left <i>Bhīṣma</i> for the night and ascended their chariots; then they bathed in the <i>Dṛṣadvatī</i>, offered oblations of water to their ancestors, etc., and entered <i>Hāstinapura</i> (XII, <b>58</b>).—§ 641: The next morning the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and the <i>Yādavas</i> set out to <i>Kurukṣetra</i>, approached <i>Bhīṣma</i> and saluted the Ṛ.; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> enquired about the origin of the word <i>rājan</i> (“king”). <i>Bhīṣma's</i> answer: In the <i>Kṛta</i> age sovereignty first began; the population of the earth became sinful; the <i>Vedas</i>, etc., were lost; D. applied to <i>Brahmán</i>, who composed a treatise of 100,000 lessons, on virtue, profit, and pleasure, and emancipation, etc. (description). <i>Brahmán</i>, addressing the gods, said that his work, aided by Chastisement (<i>Daṇḍanīti</i>), would protect the world. <i>Śiva</i> studied the great work and abridged it (then called <i>Vaiśālākṣa</i>, in 10,000 lessons) for <i>Indra</i>, who abridged it further to 5,000 lessons, and called it <i>Bāhudantaka; Bṛhaspati</i> further abridged it to 3,000 lessons, and called it <i>Bārhaspatya</i>; <i>Kāvya</i> [i.e. <i>Uśanas</i>] (the preceptor of <i>yoga</i>) further abridged it to 1,000 lessons. Thus, in view of the period of men's lives and [the general] decrease, that science (<i>śāstra</i>) was abridged by M.-ṛ. Asked by the gods, who deserved to have superiority among men, <i>Viṣṇu</i> created by his will a son, <i>Virajas</i>; but he inclined to renunciation; and so did <i>Virajas'</i> son <i>Kīrtimat</i> and the latter's son <i>Kardama. Kardama's</i> son <i>Anaṅga</i> became a protector of creatures, fully conversant with the science of chastisement. <C n='1'/><i>Anaṅga</i> <C n='2'/><i>Mṛtyu</i> <C n='1'/><i>Atibala (b) ~Sunīthā (c</i>) <C n='1'/><i>Vena (d</i>) <dvsn n='P'>Then follows the history of <i>Pṛthu Vainya (f</i>). Thus the tales of all past events (<i>āgamaś ca Purāṇānāṃ</i>), the origin of M.-ṛ., etc. (ε) were all treated of in this treatise of <i>Brahmán</i> (<i>Paitāmahe śāstre</i>) (XII, <b>59</b>). Requested by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, <i>Bhīṣma</i> discoursed on the general duties of the four orders and the special duties of each of the orders. Sacrifice has been laid down for the <i>śūdra</i> also, but without <i>svāhā</i> and <i>vaṣaṭkāra</i> or any other <i>mantra</i>; he should perform <i>pāka-</i> <i>yajñas</i>, where the <i>dakṣiṇā</i> is <i>pūrṇapātra</i> (v. the note of PCR., p. 195); in days of old a <i>śūdra</i> of the name of <i>Paijavana</i> gave a <i>dakṣiṇā</i> of 100,000 <i>pūrṇapātras</i> according to the ordinance called <i>Aindrāgnya</i> (B. <i>Aindrāgna</i>). Devotion cleanses all sacrifices. The members of the three other classes have all sprung from the <i>brahmans</i>; the <i>brahmans</i> are the gods of the very gods. The <i>śūdra</i>, who is without <i>Ṛe, Yajus</i>, and <i>Sāman</i>, has <i>Prajāpati</i> for his god, and devotion for his sacrifice. A verse sung in praise of sacrifice by the <i>Vaikhānasa munis</i>. The <i>homas</i> called <i>skanna</i> and <i>askanna</i> (XII, <b>60</b>). The four modes of life specified (ζ). M.-r. cite a verse sung by <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (XII, <b>61</b>). The four stages of life have been laid down for the <i>brahman</i>; the other three orders do not adopt them. What duties are improper for a <i>brahman</i> (XII, <b>62</b>). Continuation. The duties in the four stages of life stated more specifically. A <i>kṣatriya</i>, for leading the life of Ṛ., may adopt the <i>bhikṣu</i> mode of life; [but] a life of mendicancy is not obligatory upon the three orders (XII, <b>63</b>). The nature of kingly duties. “It has been told to you how, in days of old, many kings repaired to <i>Viṣṇu (Nārāyaṇa</i>) for the sake of the science of chastisement. S., etc. (η) are all observant of <i>kṣatriya</i> duties. In days of old when Dā. had multiplied, <i>Māndhātṛ</i> became king and performed a great sacrifice from desire of beholding <i>Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu</i>), who, in the form of <i>Indra</i>, had a discourse with him touching <i>Viṣṇu</i>, extolling the <i>kṣatriya</i> duties above all other duties, and citing the example of <i>Viṣṇu</i> himself, who for the sake of D. and Ṛ. and <i>Brahmán</i> and the <i>brahmans</i>, slew all his foes among the As. (XII, <b>64</b>). <i>Indra</i> extolled the <i>kṣatriya</i> duties. Asked by <i>Māndhātṛ</i>, he set forth the duties of the <i>Yavanas</i>, etc. (θ). Then <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> (in the form of <i>Indra</i>), accompanied by M., repaired to his eternal abode (XII, <b>65</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> discoursed in detail on the four stages of life (XII, <b>66</b>). What should be the characteristics of kingdoms. In days of old, in consequence of anarchy, men met with destruction; they made certain compacts, but soon repaired to <i>Brahmán</i> to get a king; <i>Manu</i> was prevailed upon to accept the kingdom, against getting one-fiftieth of their animals, one-tenth of their grain, one-quarter of their merit, etc. <i>Manu</i> then made his round through the world, checking everywhere all acts of wickedness. Men desiring happiness must choose a king (XII, <b>67</b>). Why the king is regarded as a god on earth. <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the discourse between <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (the son of <i>Aṅgiras</i>) and <i>Vasumanas</i> (king of <i>Kośala</i>); <i>Bṛhaspati</i> described the evils of anarchy; the king becomes <i>Agni</i>, etc. (ι). <i>Vasumanas</i> thenceforth began to protect his subjects (XII, <b>68</b>). The special duties of a king; the duties of a king in case of an invasion by a stronger monarch, quoting <i>Bṛhaspati</i> (v. 2619) and two verses (v. 2667—8) sung by <i>Aṅgiras</i> (i.e. <i>Bṛhaspati</i>). The blessedness of chastisement; the king causes the <i>Kṛta</i> age, etc. (κ), to set in (XII, <b>69</b>). The thirty six virtues that a king should possess. Hearing the words of <i>Bhīṣma</i>, king <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, protected by <i>Bhīma</i>, etc., worshipped <i>Bhīṣma</i>, and from that time began to rule according to his teaching (XII, <b>70</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>, <i>Bhiṣma</i> explained the way in which the king should discharge the duty of protection (XII, <b>71</b>). The qualifications of the king's priest: <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the old story about the discourse between <i>Aila's</i> son <i>Purūravas</i> and <i>Mātariśvan</i>, explaining the order of birth of the four classes (from <i>Brahmán's</i> mouth, arms, thighs, and feet, respectively) and their duties, the right of dominion appertaining to the <i>brahman</i>; therefore a king should appoint a priest; D., men, P., G., Us., and Rā. all depend upon sacrifices for their support, and sacrifices depend upon the king, who is <i>Indra, Yama</i>, and <i>Dharma</i> (XII, <b>72</b>). The effects of a disunion between <i>brahmans</i> and <i>kṣatriyas</i>: the old story about the discourse of <i>Aila's</i> son and <i>Kaśyapa</i>; the <i>brahman</i> and the <i>kṣatriya</i> are said to be the progenitors of all men; in consequence of the sins perpetrated by sinful men, the god <i>Rudra</i> appears in the kingdom. Asked by <i>Aila, Kaśyapa</i> explained who <i>Rudra</i> is and what his acts are (<i>Rudra</i> exists in the hearts of men; his shape is like that of the wind-gods). Then follows a discussion of the following question: “If chastisement touches the wicked and the good equally, why should the good yet abstain from acts of wickedness” (XII, <b>73</b>). The preservation and growth of the king rest upon the king's priest: <i>Mucukundopākhyāna</i> (<i>g</i>), the old narrative about the discourse between king <i>Mucukunda</i> and king <i>Vaiśravaṇa</i> (the lord of <i>Alakā</i>, Kubera) (XII, <b>74</b>). The conduct by which a king aggrandises his subjects and wins regions of felicity hereafter. <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> did not see any merit in sovereignty and wished to retire into the woods. <i>Bhīṣma</i> urged <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> to put forth manliness and exertion (XII, <b>75</b>). The difference between <i>brahmans</i> engaged in their own duties and those amongst them that are not so engaged (XII, <b>76</b>). The king is the lord of all wealth except what belongs to the <i>brahmans</i>. The old narrative of the speech made by the <i>Kaikeya</i> king unto a Rā., who was about to abduct him, but at last left him (XII, <b>77</b>). Whether a <i>brahman</i>, in seasons of distress, can practise, as a means of livelihood, the duties of a <i>vaiśya</i>; what articles, in this case, he may sell; how the king should behave when he is opposed by all the orders of men; if <i>kṣatriyas</i> become hostile to <i>brahmans</i>, how the latter should be protected; <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> inquired whether, upon an anarchy happening, any man that protects and rules acquires merit; <i>Bhīṣma</i> answered in the affirmative; a king that does not or cannot protect is useless (XII, <b>78</b>). The king of persons that are eligible as royal priests; the limits or measure of the <i>dakṣiṇā</i> (XII, <b>79</b>). Who should and who should not be trusted by the king (XII, <b>80</b>). How the king should conduct himself for winning over kinsmen and friends: the old story of a discourse between <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Nārada: Kṛṣṇa</i> said: “My heart is worried through the cruel speeches of my kinsmen; might resides in <i>Saṅkarṣaṇa</i>, mildness in <i>Gada</i>; and as regards <i>Pradyumna</i>, he surpasses even myself in beauty of person; [but] many others of the <i>Andhakas</i> and the <i>Vṛṣṇis</i> are possessed of great prosperity and might. What can be more painful than [my relation to] <i>Ahuka</i> and <i>Akrūra</i> (v. the note of PCR., p. 260)?” <i>Nārada</i> said that the calamity was due to Kṛṣṇa himself; “the kingdom cannot be taken back from <i>Babhru</i> and <i>Ugrasena</i>, employ soft words, etc.; the <i>Yādavas</i>, etc. (λ) are dependent on thee; Ṛ. always pray for thy advancement; thou art the lord of all creatures, etc.” (XII, <b>81</b>). The second means by which a king may win kinsmen and friends; an old story is cited of what the sage (<i>brahmarṣi) Kālakavṛkṣīya</i> had said to the <i>Kośala</i> king <i>Kṣemadarśin; Kālakavṛkṣīya</i> travelled through the country with a crow in a cage and observed the misdeeds of all the officers of the king, saying that it was the crow that told him all this, and related it to the king; the crow then was found pierced with a shaft within the cage; he quoted <i>Yama</i> as to the painful lot of those that serve the king; “this thy kingdom is like the river <i>Sītā</i>, boats sink in it; thy father regarded me lovingly as his friend; when distress overtook this kingdom during the reign of thy father I performed many penances.” <i>Kṣemadarśin</i> then took a minister from the <i>kṣatriya</i> order, and appointed <i>Kālakavṛkṣīya</i> as his <i>purohita</i>, and subjugated the whole earth (XII, <b>82</b>). The qualifications of legislators, ministers, courtiers, and counsellors (XII, <b>83</b>). The merits of agreeableness of speech; the old account of a conversation between <i>Bṛhaspati</i> and <i>Śakra</i> (i.e. Indra) (XII, <b>84</b>). Which are the affairs of state that a king has to deal with, and by which persons ought they to be executed? (XII, <b>85</b>). The kind of city which a king should have (XII, <b>86</b>). How a kingdom should be consolidated and how it should be protected (XII, <b>87</b>). How a king should behave if he wishes for wealth (XII, <b>88</b>). A king should not cut down trees yielding edible fruits. How one man acquires superiority over the rest; the gifts made by thee in this world support D., P., men, N., Rā., birds, and animals (XII, <b>89</b>). The duties of kings (<i>kṣatradharmān</i>) explained by <i>Aṅgiras Utathya</i> to <i>Māndhātṛ</i> <i>Yauvanāśva</i>, about the king's power being only a trust for the good of his people and not for the gratification of his own caprices; the Ṛ. made the king, intending that he should be the embodiment of righteousness on earth; he is called <i>rājan</i> (“king”) in whom righteousness shines (<i>rājeta</i>); he in whom there is no righteousness is called a <i>vṛṣala</i> (<i>yasminvilīyate dharmaḥ (= vṛṣaḥ)); dharma</i> (“righteousness”) comes (<i>sravati</i>) from <i>dhana</i> (“wealth”) or from <i>dhāraṇa</i> (“restraining”); <i>Svayambhū</i> (Brahmán) created <i>Dharma</i> for the advancement and growth of creatures; in consequence of his malice towards the brahmans <i>Śrī</i> deserted <i>Bali</i> <i>Vairocana</i> and repaired to <i>Indra</i>, and <i>Bali</i> indulged in many vain regrets. The <i>śrutis</i> declare that Unrighteousness (<i>Adharma</i>) begat a son named Pride (<i>Darpa</i>) upon <i>Śrī</i>; Pride led many D. and As. to ruin, and many R.-r.; when the king does not restrain vice, sinful Rā., and persons of neutral sex, etc., begin to take birth even in respectable families, etc. (XII, <b>90</b>). Continuation of <i>Utathya's</i> discourse. “The ages <i>Kṛta</i>, etc. (μ), are all dependent on the conduct of the king. It is said that the Creator (<i>Dhātṛ</i>) created power for the object of protecting the weak; weakness is indeed a great being, for everything depends upon it. The king is <i>Yama</i> himself. This is the way in which <i>Indra</i>, etc. (ν) have acted. D., R., P., and G. sing the praises, both here and hereafter, of that king whose conduct is righteous.” Thus addressed by <i>Utathya, Māndhātṛ</i> did as he was directed, and became the sole lord of the wide earth (XII, <b>91</b>). How a righteous king desirous of acting righteously should behave: the old story of what M.-ṛ. <i>Vāmadeva</i> sang in ancient times to king <i>Vasumanas</i> (XII, <b>92</b>); the consequences that result from the king's acting unrighteously. “<i>Yayāti Nāhuṣa</i>, thus having propounded the king's lore (<i>rājopaniṣadaṃ</i>), said that a king should slay even contemptible foes” (XII, <b>93</b>). Continuation of <i>Vāmadeva's</i> discourse. Thus addressed by <i>Vāmadeva</i>, king <i>Vasumanas</i> did as he was directed (XII, <b>94</b>). How a <i>kṣatriya</i> should act who desires to subjugate another (XII, <b>95</b>). A king should never desire to subjugate the earth by unrighteous means. It was by such behaviour that <i>Indra</i> got the sovereignty of the world. King <i>Pratardana</i>, subjugating his foes in great battle, took all their wealth, including their very grain and medicinal herbs, but left their land untouched. King <i>Divodāsa</i>, after subjugating his foes, brought away the very remnants of their sacrificial fires, their clarified butter, and their food; for this reason he was deprived of the merit of his conquest. King <i>Nābhāga</i> gave away whole kingdoms with their rulers as sacrificial presents to the <i>brahmans</i>, excepting the wealth of learned <i>brahmans</i> and ascetics (XII, <b>96</b>). <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> condemnation of <i>kṣatriya</i> practices. <i>Bhīṣma</i> pointed out that by chastening the wicked, protecting the good, performing sacrifices, etc., a king cleanses himself, and ultimately obtains a residence in <i>Indra's</i> heaven (XII, <b>97</b>). The regions of felicity acquired by heroes killed in battle: the old story of the discourse between <i>Ambarīṣa</i> and <i>Indra</i>. <i>Ambarīṣa</i>, the son of <i>Nābhāga</i>, having repaired to heaven, beheld his own generalissimo <i>Sudeva</i> in the company of <i>Indra</i>, and going to regions still higher. <i>Indra</i> explained to <i>Ambarīṣa</i> the sacrifice of battle. “That warrior who, having slain the commander of the hostile army, mounts the vehicle of his fallen antagonist, comes to be regarded as possessed of the powers of <i>Viṣṇu</i> and the intelligence of <i>Bṛhaspati</i>…thousands of Aps. covet him for their lord; having slain <i>Jambha</i>, etc. (ξ), I myself have become the chief of the celestials” (XII, <b>98</b>). The old story of the battle between <i>Pratardana</i> and king <i>Janaka</i>, who cheered his troops by showing them both heaven (full of G.-girls, etc.) and hell; his warriors vanquished their foes in battle (XII, <b>99</b>). How kings should lead their troops to battle. “It is proper to set the troops in motion on <i>Caitrī</i> or <i>Mārgaśīrṣī</i>. Keeping <i>Saptarṣayaḥ</i> (Ursa major) behind them, the troops should fight; the wind, the sun, and <i>Śukra</i> (Venus) should blow and shine from behind them; the wind is superior to the sun, the sun to <i>Śukra</i>. When a small number of troops is to fight with a great many, the array called <i>Sūcīmukha</i> should be formed” (XII, <b>100</b>). How the troops should be accoutred, armed, and disposed for battle. The <i>Gāndhāras</i>, etc. (ο), fight best with their curved knives (<i>nakhara</i>) and lances. The <i>Uśīnaras</i> are possessed of great strength and skilled in all kinds of weapons. The <i>Prāvyas</i> are skilled in fighting from the backs of elephants and conversant with stratagems (<i>kūṭayodhinaḥ</i>). The <i>Yavanas</i>, etc. (π), are well skilled in fighting with bare arms. The <i>Dākṣiṇātyas</i> are skilled in fighting sword in hand. Indications of courage (XII, <b>101</b>). What the indications are of the future success of an army. “<i>Śambara</i> has said that having afflicted a foe first, forgiveness should be shown afterwards” (XII, <b>102</b>). How a king should behave towards a foe that is mild, towards one that is fierce, and towards one that has many allies: the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Bṛhaspati</i> and <i>Indra; Bṛhaspati</i> recommended conciliation or lulling a foe into security; other means; a king should never slay a large number of the defeated troops, etc.; the indications of wicked persons. <i>Indra</i>, in subduing his foes, acted strictly according to the words of <i>Bṛhaspati</i>, and reduced all his enemies to subjection (XII, <b>103</b>). How a righteous king deprived of his kingdom should act; the discourse between <i>Kṣemadarśin</i> and <i>Kālakavṛkṣīya</i> in days of old, when prince (<i>nṛpasutaḥ) Kṣema-</i> <i>darśin</i> had become weak and fallen into great distress; “only a fool, deprived of former prosperity, censures the Supreme Ordainer (<i>Dhātṛ</i>)” (XII, <b>104</b>). Continuation of the discourse; “do thou serve the <i>Mithilā</i> king <i>Janaka</i>…; cause thy enemy to perform the great sacrifice called <i>viśvajit</i> and divest him by that means of all his possessions, and cause an ascetic conversant with <i>yoga</i> to make thy foe desire to adopt renunciation” (XII, <b>105</b>). The king's reply discountenancing deceit and fraud. Asked by <i>Kālakavṛkṣīya</i>, the <i>Videha</i> king <i>Janaka</i> made friends with the <i>Kośala</i> prince <i>Kṣemadarśin</i>, took him to <i>Mithilā</i>, and bestowed upon him his own daughter, etc. (XII, <b>106</b>). How the king should behave towards the aristocracy (XII, <b>107</b>). Important duties in brief; the relative superiority of parents and preceptors (XII, <b>108</b>). Characteristics of truth and falsehood; “even a person that is disrespectable…may succeed in earning great merit as the hunter <i>Balāka</i> by slaying the blind [beast]”; <i>Kauśika</i> again, on the banks of the <i>Gaṅgā</i>, obtained great merit (<i>sic!</i> cf. PCR., p. 352, and Kauśika<sup>6</sup>); a deceitful person always wishes to betake himself to the practice of As. (PCR. <i>amānavaṃ dharmaṃ</i>) (XII, <b>109</b>). How many creatures avoid difficulties? “they that worship with devotion the god <i>Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa</i>), that Supreme Lord of all creatures…succeed in overcoming all difficulties. He is always engaged in doing what is agreeable to <i>Arjuna</i>, and also to <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>.” Blessing upon the reader (XII, <b>110</b>). How may good and wicked men be recognized? the old story of the discourse between a tiger and a jackal: in ancient times, in a rich city called <i>Purikā</i>, there was a cruel king <i>Paurika</i>, who was reborn as a jackal; remembering his former prosperity he became filled with grief and abstained from meat, and became compassionate and truthful, etc., and lived upon fruit that had dropped from the trees; he dwelt in a vast crematorium, his birth-place. The other jackals in vain endeavoured to make him eat carrion, promising to give him food. He consented to become the minister of a tiger, on the condition that the latter should always meet with him alone and in secret, etc. The old servants of the king (i.e. the tiger) first in vain tried to bribe him; then they secretly placed the meat intended for the king in the house of the jackal. The king ordered the jackal to be slain. The mother of the king dissuaded him (“the firmament seems to be like the solid base of a vessel, the fire-fly seems to be like the actual spark of fire; in reality, however, the sky has no base, and there is no fire in the fire-fly; there is necessity for secreting”). A righteous agent of the jackal discovered everything about the false accusation. Notwithstanding the entreaties of the king, the jackal retired to the forest, gave up his body by sitting in <i>prāya</i>, and proceeded to heaven (XII, <b>111</b>). A king should not behave after the manner disclosed in the history of a camel: There was, in the <i>Kṛta</i> age, a huge camel who had recollection of all the acts of his former life; he practised severe austerities in the forest; <i>Brahmán</i> granted him the boon that he should have a neck so long that he could seize any food at even the end of 100 <i>yojanas</i>. He became idle. One day a great storm arose. The camel placed his head and a portion of his neck within the cave of a mountain; it began to pour in torrents; a jackal with his wife entered the cave for shelter and began to eat of the camel's neck, and thus the camel met with his death because of his idleness. “<i>Manu</i> has said that victory depends upon intelligence” (XII, <b>112</b>). The old story of the discourse between the Ocean and the Rivers. The Ocean (the refuge of the foes of the gods) asked the Rivers why the latter never washed away a cane; <i>Gaṅgā</i> replied that the reason is that the cane bends (XII, <b>113</b>). How a man of worth should behave when insulted with harsh words in an assembly (XII, <b>114</b>). The qualifications of persons that may be employed by the king. “Criminal laws should be duly administered, even after the manner of <i>Śaṅkha</i> and <i>Likhita</i>” (XII, <b>115</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> related the story of the dog who by favour of the Ṛ. became a <i>śarabha</i> and was, for misconduct, retransformed into his own canine form; <i>Bhīṣma</i> had heard the tale in the hermitage of <i>Rāma Jāmadagnya</i>, recited by many Ṛ.; the dog first was transformed into a leopard, then into a tiger subsisting upon the other animals of the forest (XII, <b>116</b>); then into an elephant > a lion > a <i>śarabha</i> (having eight legs and eyes on the forehead); one day, eagerly thirsting for blood, he wished to slay the sage, who then retransformed him into a dog (XII, <b>117</b>); the dog became very cheerless, and was driven by Ṛ. from his hermitage. Continuation of <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on the qualifications of servants (XII, <b>118</b>). The lessons to be drawn from the story of the dog that was transformed into a <i>śarabha</i> (XII, <b>119</b>). How a king should exercise the duty of protection; “the human body is the residence of <i>Indra</i>, etc. (ρ)” (XII, <b>120</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> discoursed about the origin and character of chastisement (“the foremost of all beings among D., Ṛ., P., Y., Rā., Pś., Sā., As., etc.”), quoting <i>Manu</i> and <i>Brahmán</i> (“the first word”: <i>prāgvacanaṃ</i>); some of the names of chastisement (σ); “beggars, principal judges, astrologers, performers of propitiatory and <i>Atharvan</i> rites, treasury, allies, grain, etc., constitute the body, composed of seven attributes and eight limbs, of a kingdom; chastisement is another powerful limb of a kingdom”; it springs from <i>Brahmán</i> (the creator of the universe with D., As., Rā., etc.) and the <i>Veda</i>; several kinds of <i>vyavahāra; Brahmán</i> has laid down: “neither mother nor father, nor brother, nor wife, nor priest, is unpunishable with that king who rules agreeably to his duty” (XII, <b>121</b>). The discourse between the <i>Aṅga</i> king <i>Vasuhoma</i> (who was pious and, with his spouse, always practised penances) and <i>Indra's</i> friend king <i>Māndhātṛ</i>, at <i>Muñjapṛṣṭha</i> (esteemed by P. and D.-ṛ.) on that peak of <i>Himavat</i> (near <i>Meru</i>) (<i>yatra Muñjāvaṭe Ramo jaṭāharaṇam</i> <i>ādiśat</i>; Nīl. is silent) a favourite haunt of <i>Rudra</i>, where <i>Vasuhoma</i> came to be regarded as a D.-r. Asked by <i>Māndhātṛ</i> about the origin of chastisement, <i>Vasuhoma</i> (who knew the doctrines of <i>Bṛhaspati</i> and <i>Uśanas</i>) related: Once <i>Brahmán</i>, desiring to perform a sacrifice, failed to find a priest; he conceived in his brain; after 1,000 years he sneezed; the fœtus, <i>Kṣupa</i>, fell from his head; he became a lord of creatures and a priest in the sacrifice of <i>Brahmán</i>. Chastisement disappeared; a great confusion set in; <i>Brahmán</i> repaired to <i>Viṣṇu</i> (armed with an enormous <i>śūla</i>), who created his own self into the form of chastisement (having righteousness for its legs); from that form the goddess <i>Sarasvatī</i> created the Science of Chastisement (<i>daṇḍanīti</i>); after this <i>Viṣṇu (śūlavarāyudhaḥ</i>) made <i>Indra</i> the ruler of D., <i>Yama Vaivasvata</i> of P., <i>Kubera</i> of treasures and Rā., <i>Meru</i> of the mountains, the Ocean of the rivers, <i>Varuṇa</i> of the waters and As., Death of life and all living things, Fire of all things possessed of energy, <i>Mahādeva</i> of R., <i>Vasiṣṭha</i> of the <i>brahmans, Jātavedas</i> of V., <i>Sūrya</i> of all luminous bodies, the Moon of Stars and constellations, <i>Aṃśumat</i> of herbs, <i>Skanda</i> (of twelve arms) of spirits and ghostly beings; Time of all creatures and the fourfold death (v. PCR.) and of grief and joy. Upon the completion of that sacrifice, <i>Mahādeva</i> made over chastisement to <i>Viṣṇu > Aṅgiras > Indra</i> and <i>Marīci > Bhṛgu ></i> all Ṛ. > Lp. > <i>Kṣupa > Manu Vaivasvata (śrāddhadeva) ></i> his sons. Chastisement remains awake, protecting all creatures, being in the hands of successive holders: <i>Indra > Agni > Varuṇa</i> <i>> Prajāpati ></i> righteousness > the son of <i>Brahmán</i>, i.e. Law > energy > the herbs > the mountains > the juices > <i>Nirṛti</i> > the planets and the luminous bodies in heaven > the <i>Vedas</i> > the form of <i>Viṣṇu</i> with equine head > <i>Brahmán ></i> <i>Mahādeva > Viśvedevāḥ ></i> Ṛ. > <i>Soma</i> > D. > the <i>brahmans</i> > the <i>kṣatriyas</i>. Several names of <i>Mahādeva</i> (τ). Blessing upon the reader (XII, <b>122</b>). <i>Bhīṣma's</i> discourse on Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure. The narrative of the discourse in olden times between Ṛ. <i>Kāmanda[ka]</i> and king <i>Āṅgariṣṭha</i> (XII, <b>123</b>). How may one acquire a virtuous behaviour? <i>Bhīṣma</i> recited the discourse of <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> to <i>Duryodhana</i>; as the latter was burning with envy at the sight of the prosperity of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and his brothers at <i>Indraprastha</i> and his mistakes in the palace he, accompanied by <i>Karṇa</i>, went to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> with the same question; “10,000 <i>snātakas</i> eat at <i>Yudhiṣṭhira's</i> palace off plates of gold; his steeds are of the <i>Tittiri</i> and the <i>Kalmāṣa</i> breeds (? so PCR.; <i>aśvāṃs</i> <i>tittiri-kalmāṣān</i>), etc.” <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> said: “<i>Māndhātṛ</i> conquered the whole world in only one night, <i>Janamejaya</i> in the course of three, <i>Nābhāga</i> in seven,” and he related the story of <i>Indra's</i> taking away from Dai. <i>Prahlāda</i> the latter's prosperity; <i>Prahlāda</i> in days of yore, by the merit of his behaviour, snatched from <i>Indra</i> his sovereignty and reduced the three worlds to subjection. <i>Indra</i> repaired for knowledge to <i>Bṛhaspati</i>, who caused him to repair to <i>Bhārgava</i> (Uśanas), who said that <i>Prahlāda</i> had better knowledge. <i>Indra</i>, in the shape of a <i>brahman</i>, repaired to <i>Prahlāda</i>, who said that he was ever obedient to the teachings of <i>Śukra</i>, etc. <i>Prahlāda</i> granted him a boon, and <i>Indra</i> wished him to acquire <i>Prahlāda's</i> nature (<i>śīla). Prahlāda</i> was filled with fear, but granted the boon. A flame of light issued out of his body: it was the embodiment of his nature, which was going away and entered the body of <i>Indra</i>. Then a similar apparition issued out: it was Righteousness; then Truth; then Good Deeds; then Might; then Prosperity, that informed him that the brahman was <i>Śakra</i>. Asked by <i>Duryodhana, Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> told him how moral conduct (<i>śīla</i>) might be acquired (XII, <b>124</b>). The characteristics of Hope; “<i>Duryodhana</i> destroyed the hope I had cherished,” said <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i>. The discourse between R.-ṛ. <i>Sumitra</i> (of the <i>Haihaya</i> race) and <i>Ṛṣabha. Sumitra</i>, when hunting, was led away by a deer that he had pierced with an arrow; he shot at it again, but in vain (XII, <b>125</b>); arrived at an asylum he asked Ṛ. about Hope (XII, <b>126</b>); <i>Ṛṣabha</i> told him that he had visited <i>Badarī</i>, the asylum of <i>Nara</i> and <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>, where the sage <i>Aśvaśiras</i> reads the <i>Vedas</i>; “having performed my ablutions in the lake and offered oblations of water to P. and D., I entered the asylum; not far from that spot I entered another retreat, where I beheld a very tall and emaciated Ṛ., <i>Tanu</i>, exceedingly feeble; he began to discourse in the midst of Ṛ.; a king came with his forces and ladies on a chariot drawn by fleet steeds; the name of this king was <i>Vīradyumna</i>; his son and only child <i>Bhūridyumna</i> had been missing, and <i>Vīradyumna</i> came there in course of his wanderings amidst the forest in pursuit of the missing one. <i>Tanu</i> said that a Ṛ. had been insulted by <i>Bhūridyumna</i>, who, asked by him for a golden jar and vegetable barks, contemptuously had refused to gratify the ascetic, who became disappointed (XII, <b>127</b>). <i>Tanu</i> hung down his head; in former days he had been disappointed by the king, and he had practised penances for a long time, and determined to drive away hope from his mind. He then discoursed about the slenderness of Hope. Then he caused the lost prince to be brought thither, rebuked the king, and displayed himself to be the god of righteousness.” Thus addressed by <i>Ṛṣabha</i>, king <i>Sumitra</i> gave up his hope (XII, <b>128</b>). <i>Bhīṣma</i> cited the old narrative of the discourse between <i>Gautama</i> and <i>Yama. Gautama</i> owned a wide retreat on the <i>Pāripātra</i> hills; for 60,000 years he underwent ascetic austerities there. One day Lp. <i>Yama (Dharma</i>) came and spoke about truth, etc. (XII, <b>129</b>). How may a king in great danger and distress left by his friends behave? (XII, <b>130</b>)."
