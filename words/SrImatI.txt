In Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddhakāṇḍa there is a story associating this Gandharva maid with the churning of the ocean of milk:<dvsn n='NI'/>A Gandharva maid named Śrīmatī who had acquired incomparable proficiency in music used to sing hymns in praise of Lakṣmīdevī. Devī appeared before her and presented a garland of Kalpaka flowers to Śrīmatī. As she was returning with the garland, she met sage Durvāsas on the way. She offered the garland to him. Durvāsas who reached Devaloka with the garland gave it to Indra. Indra used it for adorning the tusk of Airāvata. Airāvata who was annoyed at it threw it away in a fury. Durvāsas took it as a personal insult to him and in his rage cursed all the gods to be subjected to the infirmities of old age. It is to save them from the effects of old age that the ocean of milk was churned to obtain Amṛta. (For more details see under Amṛta)."
