(-कम्) A technical term in the Sāṅkhya philosophy denoting one of the five sorts of external acquiescence or indifference (see तुष्टि), viz. that condition of mind in which a man abstains from sensual enjoyments on the ground that it is sinful to injure created things, enjoyment however being impossible without doing so. Some call this indifference उत्तमाम्भस्. Compare the preceding and the terms named there. E. अनुत्तम and आम्भसिक(?)."
