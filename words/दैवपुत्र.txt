The title devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa kings.<sup>88</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>The common belief is that the designation <i>devaputra</i> ‘godson’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.<sup>89</sup> Thomas considers that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly from the Chinese.<sup>90</sup> Narain also believes the title to have been borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.<sup>91</sup> The title has been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents discovered from Chinese Turkestan.<sup>92</sup> As regards the origin of the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in many ancient empires.<sup>93</sup> The ancient Indian concept for ‘Devaputra’<sup>94</sup> meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished divinities, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters, East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the sense of Royal insignia.<sup>95</sup> In a Buddhist text of this period the question is raised ‘why kings are called <i>devaputra</i>’ and the answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods (each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.<sup>96</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’. Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as <i>deva.</i> The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt <i>devaputra</i> as an official title in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in consultation with Allan.<sup>97</sup> Kaniṣka has not used the title even in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved. It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title <i>‘devaputra’</i> is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.<sup>98</sup> The title is used for the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).<sup>99</sup> <i>Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra</i> Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.<sup>100</sup> As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll inscription is the first known instance of the application to the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly, though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his successors.”<sup>101</sup> <dvsn n='P'/>Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appellation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as ‘guardian of the northern heaven’.<sup>102</sup> It is also likely that the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara, whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.<sup>103</sup> These facts need further investigation. <dvsn n='P'/>Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity and not as a title.<sup>104</sup> Aśoka could claim the title only of <i>‘Devānām priya’</i><sup>105</sup> meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus <i>Devaputra</i> or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet <i>Devaputravat</i> has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions<sup>106</sup>"
