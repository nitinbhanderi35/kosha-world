When Dharmaputra refused to live in heaven without his brothers like Karṇa it was this Devadūta with whom Indra sent Dharmaputra to Karṇa and others. (M.B. Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 2, Verse 14). This Devadūta is to be meditated upon at dawn and before sun-set everyday. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 165, Verse 14)."
