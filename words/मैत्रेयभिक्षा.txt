As he smiled, <i>Maitreya</i> said that he did not see much difference between one that behaved as an ordinary person [such as Vyāsa] [and himself], [or generally] between one who is unemancipated and one who is emancipated, especially when [the latter, such as Maitreya] was distinguished by birth (<i>pṛthag ācaratas tāta pṛthagātmasukhātmanoḥ|alpāntaram ahaṃ</i> <i>manye, viśiṣṭam api cānvayāt</i>; cf. Nīl. and PCR.). <i>Vyāsa</i> said that he wondered that the <i>Vedas</i> should [seemingly] contain an untruth; for even a small gift (as, for instance, a little water given to a thirsty man) produces great results, and <i>Maitreya</i> had, by feeding <i>Vyāsa</i>, conquered many high regions of felicity, as one does [according to the <i>Vedas</i>, only] by great sacrifices. Gift is more auspicious than all sacred acts (XIII, <b>120</b>). <i>Maitreya</i>, approving of the words of <i>Vyāsa</i>, praised the brahmans as the root of righteousness: “if the brahman be gratified, D. and P. also are gratified,” referring to Ṛ. (XIII, <b>121</b>). <i>Vyāsa</i>, saying that even the most atrocious sins are washed off by (gifts and) penances, recommended to him the duties of householders (XIII, <b>123</b>)."
