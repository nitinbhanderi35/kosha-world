He beheld <i>Bhīṣma</i> surrounded by Ṛ <i>Vyāsa</i>, <i>Nārada, Asita Devala</i>, and by the remnant of unslain kings from various parts of the country, guarded by the warriors appointed for that duty; all the inhabitants of <i>Kurujāṅgala</i> were also there. When <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> had told his errand, <i>Bhīṣma</i> opened his eyes and saw all the <i>Bharatas</i> assembled. He seized the hand of <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> and welcomed him; he had now been lying there for fifty-eight nights, which he had felt to be as long as a century; now it was the bright fortnight of <i>Māgha</i>, and of this one-fourth had passed away. Then he reminded <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> of the instructions he had received from <i>Vyāsa</i>, and that he should regard the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> and especially <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> as his own sons. Then he praised <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> as the Supreme God, and asked him to grant him leave to die, and that he should ever protect the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>; he complained that <i>Duryodhana</i> had never been willing to follow his counsels; he said that he knew from <i>Nārada</i> and <i>Vyāsa</i>, that <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> and <i>Arjuna</i> were Ṛ <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> and <i>Nara</i>, who had lived for a long time in <i>Badarī. Kṛṣṇa</i> then gave <i>Bhīṣma</i> leave to die and come to the <i>Vasus</i>, comparing him to <i>Mārkaṇḍeya</i>. Having given some few admonitions to <i>Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i>, etc. (XIII, <b>168</b>), <i>Bhīṣma</i> successively caused his life-breaths to leave his body, and the parts of his body became successively free from wounds and arrows, at which the bystanders became filled with wonder. His soul passed through the crown of his head, ascended to heaven like a meteor, and soon became invisible, while the celestial kettledrums began to play, a rain of flowers fell down, and Si. and B-ṛ. applauded. Then the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i>, etc. (α) cremated the corpse. Then, accompanied by Ṛ., etc. (β), they proceeded to <i>Bhāgīrathī</i> (Gaṅgā), where they offered oblations of water to <i>Bhīṣma</i>. Then <i>Bhāgīrathī</i> appeared and, weeping, praised <i>Bhīṣma</i> (γ). <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> comforted her, mentioning the present felicity of <i>Bhīṣma</i> as one of the <i>Vasus</i>, and declared that he had not been slain by <i>Śikhaṇḍin</i>, but by <i>Arjuna</i>. <i>Gaṅgā</i> gave up her grief; all the kings, headed by <i>Kṛṣṇa</i>, obtained her permission to depart, and all returned [to the city] (XIII, <b>169</b>)."
