The Dramatic composition ‘Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi’ is his work. <dvsn n='NI'/>Śaktibhadra, after writing his drama, once read it out to Śaṅkarācārya. As the ācārya was observing silence that day, he made no comments about the drama. Disappointed at this silence of his Guru, the dramatist burnt his work to ashes in fire. When his observance of silence was over, the Guru asked his disciple for the drama. When told about the burning of the drama the ācārya repeated from memory the whole drama. The above legend is widely prevalent in Kerala."
