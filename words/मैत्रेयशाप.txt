Maitreya</i> came, having on a <i>tīrthayātrā</i> arrived at <i>Kurujāṅgala</i>, and having visited <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> in the <i>Kāmyaka</i> wood. As <i>Maitreya</i> advised <i>Duryodhana</i> to make peace with the <i>Pāṇḍavas</i> now that <i>Bhīma</i> had slain <i>Kirmīra</i>, etc., <i>Duryodhana</i> gave him a slight by slapping his thigh and scratching the ground with his foot. Therefore <i>Maitreya</i> cursed him, saying that <i>Bhīma</i> should smash that thigh of his with his mace; this curse, however, should not take effect if he made peace with the <i>Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</i> wished to hear about the death of <i>Kirmīra</i>, but <i>Maitreya</i> would not speak again to him, because his words were not regarded by <i>Duryodhana</i>; saying that <i>Vidura</i> would relate it to him, he went away. <i>Duryodhana</i> went out perturbed. (III, <b>10</b>.)"
