An ugly woman about whom the following story is told in Chapter 126, of Uttarakhaṇḍa in Padma Purāṇa. <dvsn n='NI'/>Kubjā became a widow in her very childhood, and she spent eight years in observing auspicious ceremonies. As she took the ‘Māgha bath’ every year she attained salvation. This was the period when Sunda and Upasunda were harassing the world, and to destroy them Kubjā incarnated as Tilottamā and hooked them by her excellent beauty. They fought each other for her hand and got killed. Brahmā was pleased at this and granted Kubjā a place in Sūryaloka."
