But then he was filled with pride in consequence of the boon he had received from all the gods, and he ceased to perform religious actions; for a very long time he used to employ the Ṛ. by turns as the bearers of his vehicles; but in consequence of his abstention from religious acts his energy began to diminish; when it was <i>Agastya's</i> turn to carry the vehicle, <i>Bhṛgu</i> came to the hermitage of <i>Agastya (Maitrāvaruṇi</i>), and when the latter, mentioning <i>Brahmán's</i> boon to <i>Nahuṣa</i> (that whoever would come within the range of his eyesight would, deprived of all energy, be within his sway), and that <i>Brahmán</i> had given him <i>aṃṛta</i> to drink, despaired of being able to curse him, <i>Bhṛgu</i> said that he had come at the command of <i>Brahmán</i>, and that he would curse <i>Nahuṣa</i> to be a snake, when he insulted <i>Agastya</i> by a kick, and this very day he would hurl him down and re-establish <i>Indra. Agastya</i> became highly gratified (XIII, <b>99</b>). Asked by <i>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma</i> continued [referring to and developing the beginning of XIII, <b>99</b>: <i>Nahuṣa's</i> sacrificial rites and presents were obstructed by Rā.]: <i>Nahuṣa</i> ordered Ṛ. <i>Agastya</i> to carry the vehicle from the banks of <i>Sarasvatī. Bhṛgu</i>, telling <i>Agastya</i> to close his eyes, had entered the matted locks of <i>Agastya</i>, taking care not to cast his eyes upon <i>Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa</i> urged <i>Agastya</i> on with his goad and then struck him on the head with his left foot. Then <i>Nahuṣa</i> was cursed by <i>Bhṛgu</i> and transformed into a snake, but, in consequence of his gifts, etc., he retained his memory, and, assisted by <i>Agastya</i>, pacified <i>Bhṛgu</i>, who said that <i>Yudhiṣṭhira</i> would rescue him, and then went to the abode of <i>Brahmán</i> and informed him, while <i>Agastya</i> returned to his own hermitage. <i>Brahmán</i> once more installed (caused the gods to instal) <i>Indra</i> in the sovereignty of heaven. “Thou hast, O king, rescued <i>Nahuṣa</i> from <i>Bhṛgu's</i> curse; he ascended to the abode of <i>Brahmán</i> before thy eyes; in consequence of the merits he had acquired through acts of the kind I have mentioned, he succeeded in once more regaining his lost position. Hence, when evening comes, persons leading the domestic mode of life, should give lamps” (XIII, <b>100</b>)."
