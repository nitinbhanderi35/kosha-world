The daughters were married to Ruci, Kardama and Dakṣa respectively. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata). <dvsn n='NI'/>Priyavrata married Barhiṣmatī daughter of Kardamaprajāpati. He got of her two daughters named Samrāṭ and Kukṣi and ten sons named Agnīdhra, Agnibāhu, Vapuṣmān, Dyutimān, Medhas, Medhātithi, Bhavya, Savana, Putra and Jyotiṣmān. Of these Jyotiṣmān was really possessing jyotis (brilliance). All the sons, Medhas, Agnibāhū and Putra, were interested in the practice of yoga and were aware of their previous births. Priyavrata distributed seven islands to seven of his sons as follows: <dvsn n='NI'/>Jambūdvīpa to Agnīdhra; Plakṣadvīpa to Medhātithi; Śālmalīdvīpa to Vapuṣmān; Kuśadvīpa to Jyotiṣmān; Krauñcadvīpa to Dyutimān; Śākadvīpa to Bhavya; and Puṣkaradvīpa to Savana. <dvsn n='NI'/>Agnīdhra had nine sons named Nābhi, Kimpuruṣa, Harivarṣa, Ilāvṛta, Ramya, Hiraṇvān, Kuru, Bhadrāśva and Ketumāla. (Chapter 1, Aṃśa 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa). <dvsn n='NI'/>Priyavrata once circled round Meru in his chariot. As if competing with the Sun Priyavrata started his circling along with sunrise and ended it at sunset. He did so seven days making nights look like day and the sun appear dim and faded. The Sun was dejected and it was at the request of the Trimūrtis that Priyavrata stopped his circumambulation. It was the path of Priyavrata's circling for seven days that later became the seven oceans of Purāṇic fame. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa)."
