In Mahābhārata, Karṇa Parva, Chapter 156 we read that his younger brother was killed by Arjuna. The Kings of Kāmboja were all known as Kāmbojas. Long ago, this country was ruled by a King named Kāmboja. In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 166, Verse 77, we see that this Kāmboja was given a sword by the King Dhundhumāra. Perhaps it was from this King Kāmboja that the country came to be called ‘Kāmboja’."
