That <i>aṅga-bhoga</i> means decoration of the image of a deity is clear from the fact that a queen is known to have received a village as an <i>agrahāra</i> for her <i>aṅga-bhoga,</i> i. e. as her pin-money (<i>Bomb. Gaz.,</i> Vol. I, Part ii, p. 448). Sometimes the land granted for the <i>aṅga-</i> <i>bhoga</i> of a deity came to be known as the deity's <i>aṅga-bhoga</i> (<i>Ep. Ind.,</i> Vol. XXXIII, p. 182); cf. <i>aṅga,</i> same as <i>gātra</i> (IA 11)."
