At that time a priest of the King had taken life as a Sārasa bird. One day the monkey tried to catch the bird and then the bird (priest) reminded him of his previous birth and told him that in their next birth both of them would be swans and in the birth after that they would become men again. (Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa)."
