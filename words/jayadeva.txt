            "content": "JAYADEVA I¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 13th century A.D. He is the author of the play ‘Prasannarāghavam’. As far as the story of Śrī Rāma is concerned, some changes have been made in this play from that given by Bhavabhūti in his ‘Mahāvīracarita’. According to this play Śrī Rāma and Bāṇāsura both were lovers of Sītā. The famous work ‘Candrāloka’, a treatise on rhetorical figures, was written by this poet Jayadeva. His most important work is ‘Gītagovinda’, the theme of which is the early life of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, especially the love between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, which is very touchingly described. This book consists of 12 sargas and each sarga contains 24 octaves. This poet was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He used to sing lyrics before the image of Kṛṣṇa while his wife danced according to the beat."
